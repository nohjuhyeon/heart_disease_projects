Anterior weight bearing was measured as the horizontal distance of the posterior superior body of the C2 vertebra compared to a vertical line drawn superiorly from the posterior inferior body of the C7 vertebra. The measurements were sorted into 2 groups, cervical complaint and noncervical complaint groups. The data were then partitioned into age by decades, sex, and angle categories.\\nResults: Patients with lordosis of 20 degrees or less were more likely to have cervicogenic symptoms (P < .001). The association between cervical pain and lordosis of 0 degrees or less was significant (P < .0001). The odds that a patient with cervical pain had a lordosis of 0 degrees or less was 18 times greater than for a patient with a noncervical complaint. Patients with cervical pain had less lordosis and this was consistent over all age ranges. Males had larger median cervical lordosis than females (20 degrees vs 14 degrees) (2-sided Mann-Whitney U test, P = .016). When partitioned by age grouping, this trend is significant only in the 40- to 49-year-old range (2-sided Mann-Whitney U test, P < .01).\\nConclusion: We found a statistically significant association between cervical pain and lordosis < 20 degrees and a \\\"clinically normal\\\" range for cervical lordosis of 31 degrees to 40 degrees. Maintenance of a lordosis in the range of 31 degrees to 40 degrees could be a clinical goal for chiropractic treatment.\",\n          \"A well established premise in the field of craniomandibular and cervical spine orthopedics is that forward head posture (FHP) adversely affects mandibular position and therefore dental occlusion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of FHP on the initial occlusal contact pattern (IOCP) in order to provide further clarification on this important topic. Thirty-nine healthy subjects, 10-74 years old, underwent a series of tests in which the IOCP was recorded in four different head positions using the T-Scan Occlusal Diagnostic System. Three tests each were performed in military posture (MP), natural sitting posture (NP), FHP, and maximal forward head posture (MFHP) for a total of twelve trials. A repeated measures analysis of variance failed to demonstrate a correlation between FHP and IOCP; however, a multiple linear regression analysis revealed a relationship between age and the IOCP. This study raises questions about the relationship between FHP and occlusion.\",\n          \"Our aim was to investigate the potential effect of advancement by bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) on the natural position of the head by using 3-dimensional cephalomentric analysis. Seven consecutive patients who had had only BSSO advancement, and had had preoperative and 6-week postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CT) scans, were recruited to this retrospective study. Two variables, SNB and SNC2, were used to indicate the craniomandibular alignment and craniocervical inclination, respectively, in the midsagittal plane. Using 3-dimensional cephalometric analysis software, the SNB and the SNC2 were recorded in volume and measured in the midsagittal plane at 3 independent time-points. The reliability was measured and a paired t test used to assess the significance of differences between the means of SNB and SNC2 before and after operation. The 3-dimensional cephalometric measurement showed good reliability. The SNB was increased as planned in all the mandibles that were advanced, the cervical vertebrae were brought forward after BSSO, and the SNC2 was significantly increased in 6 of the 7 patients. Three-dimensional cephalometric analysis may provide an alternative way of assessing cephalometrics. After BSSO advancement, the natural position of the head changed by increasing the craniocervical inclination in an anteroposterior direction.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The cervical extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left rotation measurers decreased significantly with VDT work.\\nConclusions: We postulate that even short-term VDT work has the potential to cause problems. It is necessary to develop a CROM self-measuring device and to monitor patients' musculoskeletal changes frequently.\",\n          \"An 84-year-old driver suffered cardiac arrest after a traffic accident. He was quickly resuscitated and transferred to a hospital where he was treated in a state of unconsciousness and respiratory failure for 20 days until his death. The brain stem was rendered anoxic during cardiac arrest, which caused the respiratory failure. Artificial ventilation and catecholamine infusion were carried out, resulting in myocardial degeneration. Bilateral stenosis of the vertebral arteries was disclosed, but no injuries or hemorrhage of the brain and spinal cord were detected. On days 3 and 4 after admission, immediately after the head of the victim was flexed forward for examinations, cardiac arrest was induced twice, but was controlled either by administering atropine or by restoring the original posture. Positional change is known to induce vagal reflex that results in bradycardia, hypotension or cardiac arrest in sensitive persons. The victim might have undergone the reflex-mediated cardiac arrest after the accident, to which the stenosis of the vertebral arteries may have contributed.\",\n          \"Background: Oscillatory stimulation provides strong sensory stimulation, which can activate muscle spindles, strengthening proprioceptive sense and, therefore, helping to strengthen the muscles involved in posture stability.\\nObjective: This study aimed to investigate the difference in average distribution of plantar pressure resulting from changes in the forward head position (FHP) angle caused by controlling muscle activity in the neck and shoulders through Bodyblade.\\nMethods: The subjects were divided into an experimental group (Bodyblade, n= 15) and a control group (general physiotherapy, n= 15). Eighteen sessions of exercise were implemented. Craniovertebral angle (CVA) and cranial rotation angle (CRA) were measured to evaluate the change of FHP. The Gaitview AFA-50 (Alfoots Co, Korea) was used to measure the plantar pressure distribution.\\nResults: The experimental group showed a larger increase in CVA than the control group (p< 0.05). Only the experimental group showed a significant decrease in CRA (p< 0.05).Both the anterior pressure and posterior pressure showed a significant improvement only in the experimental group (p< 0.05). The experimental group showed a larger increase in anterior/posterior ratio than the control group (p< 0.05).\\nConclusions: Bodyblade improves the angle of FHP, thus positively affecting the average

However, few studies have objectively quantified the change in head posture induced shoulder pain during VDT work.\\nObjective: This study elucidated changes in pressure pain in the upper trapezius muscles, cervical ROM, and the cervical flexion--relaxation ratio after continuous long-term VDT work.\\nParticipants: Twelve young VDT workers were recruited.\\nMethods: The pressure pain of the upper trapezius muscles, active CROM, and cervical flexion--relaxation ratio were measured in all subjects once before and once after VDT work.\\nResults: The pressure pain threshold of the right upper trapezius muscle was 6.9 \\u00b1 1.6 lb before VDT work and 6.1 \\u00b1 1.0 lb after VDT work, revealing a significant increase with VDT work. The cervical extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left rotation measurers decreased significantly with VDT work.\\nConclusions: We postulate that even short-term VDT work has the potential to cause problems. It is necessary to develop a CROM self-measuring device and to monitor patients' musculoskeletal changes frequently.\",\n          \"An 84-year-old driver suffered cardiac arrest after a traffic accident. He was quickly resuscitated and transferred to a hospital where he was treated in a state of unconsciousness and respiratory failure for 20 days until his death. The brain stem was rendered anoxic during cardiac arrest, which caused the respiratory failure. Artificial ventilation and catecholamine infusion were carried out, resulting in myocardial degeneration. Bilateral stenosis of the vertebral arteries was disclosed, but no injuries or hemorrhage of the brain and spinal cord were detected. On days 3 and 4 after admission, immediately after the head of the victim was flexed forward for examinations, cardiac arrest was induced twice, but was controlled either by administering atropine or by restoring the original posture. Positional change is known to induce vagal reflex that results in bradycardia, hypotension or cardiac arrest in sensitive persons. The victim might have undergone the reflex-mediated cardiac arrest after the accident, to which the stenosis of the vertebral arteries may have contributed.\",\n          \"Background: Oscillatory stimulation provides strong sensory stimulation, which can activate muscle spindles, strengthening proprioceptive sense and, therefore, helping to strengthen the muscles involved in posture stability.\\nObjective: This study aimed to investigate the difference in average distribution of plantar pressure resulting from changes in the forward head position (FHP) angle caused by controlling muscle activity in the neck and shoulders through Bodyblade.\\nMethods: The subjects were divided into an experimental group (Bodyblade, n= 15) and a control group (general physiotherapy, n= 15). Eighteen sessions of exercise were implemented. Craniovertebral angle (CVA) and cranial rotation angle (CRA) were measured to evaluate the change of FHP. The Gaitview AFA-50 (Alfoots Co, Korea) was used to measure the plantar pressure distribution.\\nResults: The experimental group showed a larger increase in CVA than the control group (p< 0.05). Only the experimental group showed a significant decrease in CRA (p< 0.05).Both the anterior pressure and posterior pressure showed a significant improvement only in the experimental group (p< 0.05). The experimental group showed a larger increase in anterior/posterior ratio than the control group (p< 0.05).\\nConclusions: Bodyblade improves the angle of FHP, thus positively affecting the average ratio of plantar pressure.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date_year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

However, few studies have objectively quantified the change in head posture induced shoulder pain during VDT work.\\nObjective: This study elucidated changes in pressure pain in the upper trapezius muscles, cervical ROM, and the cervical flexion--relaxation ratio after continuous long-term VDT work.\\nParticipants: Twelve young VDT workers were recruited.\\nMethods: The pressure pain of the upper trapezius muscles, active CROM, and cervical flexion--relaxation ratio were measured in all subjects once before and once after VDT work.\\nResults: The pressure pain threshold of the right upper trapezius muscle was 6.9 \\u00b1 1.6 lb before VDT work and 6.1 \\u00b1 1.0 lb after VDT work, revealing a significant increase with VDT work.

He was quickly resuscitated and transferred to a hospital where he was treated in a state of unconsciousness and respiratory failure for 20 days until his death. The brain stem was rendered anoxic during cardiac arrest, which caused the respiratory failure. Artificial ventilation and catecholamine infusion were carried out, resulting in myocardial degeneration. Bilateral stenosis of the vertebral arteries was disclosed, but no injuries or hemorrhage of the brain and spinal cord were detected. On days 3 and 4 after admission, immediately after the head of the victim was flexed forward for examinations, cardiac arrest was induced twice, but was controlled either by administering atropine or by restoring the original posture. Positional change is known to induce vagal reflex that results in bradycardia, hypotension or cardiac arrest in sensitive persons.

Eighteen sessions of exercise were implemented. Craniovertebral angle (CVA) and cranial rotation angle (CRA) were measured to evaluate the change of FHP. The Gaitview AFA-50 (Alfoots Co, Korea) was used to measure the plantar pressure distribution.\\nResults: The experimental group showed a larger increase in CVA than the control group (p< 0.05). Only the experimental group showed a significant decrease in CRA (p< 0.05).Both the anterior pressure and posterior pressure showed a significant improvement only in the experimental group (p< 0.05).

              "      <td>Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p &lt; 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Background: Forward head posture and rounded shoulder posture are common postural variants found in upper crossed syndrome, which can lead to limited neck mobility, respiratory problems, and other issues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p &lt; 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for the Rt.

Clinical outcomes included neck pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale, neck disability measured through the neck disability index, and forward head posture measured through the cranial vertebral angle. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and the four and eight weeks after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain intensity, CVA, and neck disability after the intervention. However, the CBT group demonstrated greater improvements than the MRT group. The difference in outcomes between the groups was statistically significant.

Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P &lt; .05) and strategy scores (P &lt; .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P &lt; .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P &gt; .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.</td>\n",

              "0     Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p < 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.   \n",

The participants were assessed based on age, gender, dominant side, the amount of time they spent on their smartphones, the purpose of their use, and their posture. The Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Form (SAS-SF) was used to determine addictes and non-addicts. The cut-off value of SAS-SF is 31 and above for male and 33 and above for female.\\nResults: There were 136 participants in the study. The posture score for addicts and non-addicts ones was not significantly different (p > 0,05), but the number of trigger points, maximal bending posture and trigger points in the right levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles were significantly higher in the smartphone addict participants (p < 0,05).\\nConclusions: Smartphone addiction in university students is associated with postural changes and trigger points in the bilateral levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles. Public health programs should be developed to raise awareness about smartphone addiction, encourage screen breaks, and emphasize physical activity and exercise regularly.   \n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj < 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj < 0.05/4) for the Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD.

A total of sixty-six eligible participants with chronic neck pain and forward head posture were randomized into the Myofascial Release Therapy (MRT) group (n = 33) and MRT and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) group (n = 33). Clinical outcomes included neck pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale, neck disability measured through the neck disability index, and forward head posture measured through the cranial vertebral angle. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and the four and eight weeks after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain intensity, CVA, and neck disability after the intervention. However, the CBT group demonstrated greater improvements than the MRT group. The difference in outcomes between the groups was statistically significant. Myofascial Release Therapy combined with CBT is an effective treatment method for patients with chronic neck pain and forward head posture.   \n",

Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P < .05) and strategy scores (P < .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P < .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P > .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.   \n",

This hypothesis is examined in the light of the clinical evidence provided by the symptomatology and treatment of 19 consecutive cases of intracranial mass lesions exhibiting truncal ataxia.   \n",

This lesion, untreated, may result in damage to the spinal cord, paresis or sudden death. Occipital headache, present in 13 of 22 patients, was often aggravated by working with the head in forward flexion. Paresthesias were present in six patients. The spine of the axis was often prominent. In three patients there was objective evidence of cord compression with sensory and/or pyramidal signs. In eight the lesion was asymptomatic and discovered by routine lateral radiography in flexion, the position of maximum subluxation.Conservative treatment involved the continuous use of a cervical collar to limit neck flexion.

Since positional nystagmus may be difficult to evoke and may be elicited at one time and not at another, it is important to make repeated tests, lest a causative lesion be overlooked. Vertigo in such cases may be caused by pathologic change in the eighth peripheral nerve or in the central vestibular pathways. Sometimes no organic disease is observable even though positional nystagmus validates a complaint of vertigo. In such instances the patient should be assured that he does not have a progressive disease and be advised against activity in which dizziness would be hazardous.   \n",

              "      <td>Background: Jaw clenching improves dynamic reactive balance on an oscillating platform during forward acceleration and is associated with decreased mean sway speed of different body regions.\\nObjective: It is suggested that jaw clenching as a concurrent muscle activity facilitates human motor excitability, increasing the neural drive to distal muscles. The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon was studied based on leg and trunk muscle activity (iEMG) and co-contraction ratio (CCR).\\nMethods: Forty-eight physically active and healthy adults were assigned to three groups, performing three oral motor tasks (jaw clenching, tongue pressing against the palate or habitual lower jaw position) during a dynamic one-legged stance reactive balance task on an oscillating platform. The iEMG and CCR of posture-relevant muscles and muscle pairs were analysed during platform forward acceleration.\\nResults: Tongue pressing caused an adjustment of co-contraction patterns of distal muscle groups based on changes in biomechanical coupling between the head and trunk during static balancing at the beginning of the experiment.

              "      <td>Purpose: With the increasing level of automation in automobiles, the advent of autonomous vehicles has reduced the tendency of drivers and passengers to focus on the task of driving. The increasing automation in automobiles reduced the drivers' and passengers' focus on driving, which allowed occupants to choose a more relaxed and comfortable sitting position. Meanwhile, the occupant's sitting position went from a frontal, upright position to a more relaxed and reclined one, which resulted in the existing restraint systems can not to keep occupants safe and secure. This study aimed to determine the effects of different reclining states on occupants' lumbar and neck injuries.\\nMethods: This is an original research on the field of automotive safety engineering. Occupants in different initial seating positions (25°, 35°, 45°, and 55°) were adapted to changes in seat back angle and restraint systems and placed in the same frontal impact environment. Neck injury indexes, lumbar axial compression force and acceleration, as well as occupant dynamic response during the impact, were compared in different seating positions. The injury response and kinematic characteristics of occupants in different reclining positions were analyzed by the control variable method.\\nResults: As the sitting angle increased, the occupant's head acceleration decreased, and the forward-lean angle decreased. Occupants in the standard sitting position had the greatest neck injury, with an Nij of 0.95, and were susceptible to abbreviated injury scale 2+ cervical medullary injuries. As the seatback angle increased, the geometric position of the lumbar spine tended to be horizontal, and the impact load transmitted greater forces to the lumbar spine. The occupant's lumbar injury was greatest in the lying position, with a peak axial compression force on the lumbar region of 5.5 KN, which was 2.3 KN greater than in the standard sitting position.\\nConclusion: The study of occupant lumbar and neck injuries based on different recline states can provide a theoretical basis for optimizing lumbar evaluation indexes, which is conducive to the understanding of the lumbar injury mechanism and the comprehensive consideration of occupant safety protection.</td>\n",

This study aimed to explore the impact of unilateral mastectomy on body posture.\\nMethods: A prospective, longitudinal, observational study with a one-group repeated-measures design was conducted. Patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy were recruited from a university-affiliated hospital in Western China and monitored for 12 months post-surgery. A trained nurse assessed seven postural baseline parameters on the day of suture removal and at 3, 6, and 12 months after unilateral mastectomy. Two parameters were in the sagittal plane (forward head posture and trunk rotation angle), and five were in the coronal plane (neck tilt, shoulder asymmetry, scapular asymmetry, scapular asymmetry relative to the spine, and pelvic tilt).\\nResults: The final analysis included 159 patients. Baseline prevalence of most postural abnormalities ranged from 50.94% to 59.75%, with mean deviations between 2.74 and 4.51 mm. At 12 months post-mastectomy, prevalence and mean deviations increased by more than 30% and 3.50 mm, respectively, compared to baseline. Postural abnormalities increased gradually in the first 3 months, notably between the 3rd and 6th months, and slowed between the 6th and 12th months. On the mastectomy side, coronal plane abnormalities significantly increased within 12 months: earlobe to acromion distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P &lt; 0.001), depressed shoulder height (Wald χ2 = 42.253, P &lt; 0.001), depressed scapula height (Wald χ2 = 31.587, P &lt; 0.001), scapula to spine distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P &lt; 0.001), and elevated pelvic height (Wald χ2 = 48.924, P &lt; 0.001).\\nConclusions: Postural changes are common post-unilateral mastectomy, with prevalence and deviation increasing gradually, particularly between 3 and 6 months post-mastectomy.

              "      <td>Objective: Real-life car crashes are often preceded by an evasive maneuver, which can alter the occupant posture and muscle state. To simulate the occupant response in such maneuvers, human body models (HBMs) with active muscles have been developed. The aim of this study was to implement an omni-directional rotational head-neck muscle controller in the SAFER HBM and compare the bio-fidelity of the HBM with a rotational controller to the HBM with a translational controller, in simulations of evasive maneuvers. Methods: The rotational controller was developed using an axis-angle representation of head rotations, with x, y, and z components in the axis. Muscle load sharing was based on rotational direction in the simulation and muscle activity recorded in three volunteer experiments in these directions. The gains of the rotational and translational controller were tuned to minimize differences between translational and rotational head displacements of the HBM and volunteers in braking and lane change maneuvers using multi-objective optimizations. Bio-fidelity of the model with tuned controllers was evaluated objectively using CORrelation and Analysis (CORA). Results: The results indicated comparable performance for both controllers after tuning, with somewhat higher bio-fidelity for rotational kinematics with the translational controller. After tuning, good or excellent bio-fidelity was indicated for both controllers in the loading direction (forward in braking, and lateral in lane change), with CORA scores of 0.86-0.99 and 0.93-0.98 for the rotational and translational controllers, respectively. For rotational displacements, and translational displacements in the other directions, bio-fidelity ranged from poor to excellent, with slightly higher average CORA scores for the HBM with the translational controller in both braking and lane changing. Time-averaged muscle activity was within one standard deviation of time-averaged muscle activity from volunteers. Conclusion: Overall, the results show that when tuned, both the translational and rotational controllers can be used to predict the occupant response to an evasive maneuver, allowing for the inclusion of evasive maneuvers prior to a crash in evaluation of vehicle safety. The rotational controller shows potential in controlling omni-directional head displacements, but the translational controller outperformed the rotational controller. Thus, for now, the recommendation is to use the translational controller with tuned gains.</td>\n",

A full field (360 degrees) flight simulator projection system was used to investigate the sensations resulting from pitch, roll, and yaw stimuli at various head orientations. Steady yaw rate (circularvection) and development of a constant roll tilt angle, for the head erect and constant velocity yaw and roll stimuli, confirmed previous reports. Pitch stimuli also were found to produce a sensation of tilting to a steady pitch angle, which was much stronger for pitch forward than backward. Pitch and roll effects were strongly dependent on head position, increasing for the head rolled 90 degrees to the side or inverted, and decreasing for the head pitched 25 degrees forward.

The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon was studied based on leg and trunk muscle activity (iEMG) and co-contraction ratio (CCR).\\nMethods: Forty-eight physically active and healthy adults were assigned to three groups, performing three oral motor tasks (jaw clenching, tongue pressing against the palate or habitual lower jaw position) during a dynamic one-legged stance reactive balance task on an oscillating platform. The iEMG and CCR of posture-relevant muscles and muscle pairs were analysed during platform forward acceleration.\\nResults: Tongue pressing caused an adjustment of co-contraction patterns of distal muscle groups based on changes in biomechanical coupling between the head and trunk during static balancing at the beginning of the experiment. Neither iEMG nor CCR measurement helped detect a general neuromuscular effect of jaw clenching on the dynamic reactive balance.\\nConclusion: The findings might indicate the existence of robust fixed patterns of rapid postural responses during the important initial phases of balance recovery.   \n",

The increasing automation in automobiles reduced the drivers' and passengers' focus on driving, which allowed occupants to choose a more relaxed and comfortable sitting position. Meanwhile, the occupant's sitting position went from a frontal, upright position to a more relaxed and reclined one, which resulted in the existing restraint systems can not to keep occupants safe and secure. This study aimed to determine the effects of different reclining states on occupants' lumbar and neck injuries.\\nMethods: This is an original research on the field of automotive safety engineering. Occupants in different initial seating positions (25°, 35°, 45°, and 55°) were adapted to changes in seat back angle and restraint systems and placed in the same frontal impact environment. Neck injury indexes, lumbar axial compression force and acceleration, as well as occupant dynamic response during the impact, were compared in different seating positions. The injury response and kinematic characteristics of occupants in different reclining positions were analyzed by the control variable method.\\nResults: As the sitting angle increased, the occupant's head acceleration decreased, and the forward-lean angle decreased. Occupants in the standard sitting position had the greatest neck injury, with an Nij of 0.95, and were susceptible to abbreviated injury scale 2+ cervical medullary injuries. As the seatback angle increased, the geometric position of the lumbar spine tended to be horizontal, and the impact load transmitted greater forces to the lumbar spine. The occupant's lumbar injury was greatest in the lying position, with a peak axial compression force on the lumbar region of 5.5 KN, which was 2.3 KN greater than in the standard sitting position.\\nConclusion: The study of occupant lumbar and neck injuries based on different recline states can provide a theoretical basis for optimizing lumbar evaluation indexes, which is conducive to the understanding of the lumbar injury mechanism and the comprehensive consideration of occupant safety protection.   \n",

There is a strong association between temporomandibular disorders and forward head syndrome. Where the muscular component is the main affected, with the appearance of more trigger points at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscles, upper trapezius, rectus capitis posterior and upper oblique capitis. Degenerative changes in the temporomandibular joint have been observed, but evidence is still lacking to ensure that Forward Head Syndrome is the etiological factor.   \n",

This study aimed to explore the impact of unilateral mastectomy on body posture.\\nMethods: A prospective, longitudinal, observational study with a one-group repeated-measures design was conducted. Patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy were recruited from a university-affiliated hospital in Western China and monitored for 12 months post-surgery. A trained nurse assessed seven postural baseline parameters on the day of suture removal and at 3, 6, and 12 months after unilateral mastectomy. Two parameters were in the sagittal plane (forward head posture and trunk rotation angle), and five were in the coronal plane (neck tilt, shoulder asymmetry, scapular asymmetry, scapular asymmetry relative to the spine, and pelvic tilt).\\nResults: The final analysis included 159 patients. Baseline prevalence of most postural abnormalities ranged from 50.94% to 59.75%, with mean deviations between 2.74 and 4.51 mm. At 12 months post-mastectomy, prevalence and mean deviations increased by more than 30% and 3.50 mm, respectively, compared to baseline. Postural abnormalities increased gradually in the first 3 months, notably between the 3rd and 6th months, and slowed between the 6th and 12th months. On the mastectomy side, coronal plane abnormalities significantly increased within 12 months: earlobe to acromion distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P < 0.001), depressed shoulder height (Wald χ2 = 42.253, P < 0.001), depressed scapula height (Wald χ2 = 31.587, P < 0.001), scapula to spine distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P < 0.001), and elevated pelvic height (Wald χ2 = 48.924, P < 0.001).\\nConclusions: Postural changes are common post-unilateral mastectomy, with prevalence and deviation increasing gradually, particularly between 3 and 6 months post-mastectomy. Early rehabilitation initiation is recommended to mitigate postural changes.\\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2000040897.   \n",
              "20    Objective: Real-life car crashes are often preceded by an evasive maneuver, which can alter the occupant posture and muscle state. To simulate the occupant response in such maneuvers, human body models (HBMs) with active muscles have been developed. The aim of this study was to implement an omni-directional rotational head-neck muscle controller in the SAFER HBM and compare the bio-fidelity of the HBM with a rotational controller to the HBM with a translational controller, in simulations of evasive maneuvers. Methods: The rotational controller was developed using an axis-angle representation of head rotations, with x, y, and z components in the axis. Muscle load sharing was based on rotational direction in the simulation and muscle activity recorded in three volunteer experiments in these directions. The gains of the rotational and translational controller were tuned to minimize differences between translational and rotational head displacements of the HBM and volunteers in braking and lane change maneuvers using multi-objective optimizations. Bio-fidelity of the model with tuned controllers was evaluated objectively using CORrelation and Analysis (CORA). Results: The results indicated comparable performance for both controllers after tuning, with somewhat higher bio-fidelity for rotational kinematics with the translational controller. After tuning, good or excellent bio-fidelity was indicated for both controllers in the loading direction (forward in braking, and lateral in lane change), with CORA scores of 0.86-0.99 and 0.93-0.98 for the rotational and translational controllers, respectively. For rotational displacements, and translational displacements in the other directions, bio-fidelity ranged from poor to excellent, with slightly higher average CORA scores for the HBM with the translational controller in both braking and lane changing. Time-averaged muscle activity was within one standard deviation of time-averaged muscle activity from volunteers. Conclusion: Overall, the results show that when tuned, both the translational and rotational controllers can be used to predict the occupant response to an evasive maneuver, allowing for the inclusion of evasive maneuvers prior to a crash in evaluation of vehicle safety. The rotational controller shows potential in controlling omni-directional head displacements, but the translational controller outperformed the rotational controller. Thus, for now, the recommendation is to use the translational controller with tuned gains.   \n",

Despite the classical conception (Lutkens) of gall bladders invariably oblique, it showed that some are vertical, horizontal or even descending. Contrary to this classical conception which describes the infundibulum and cystic ducts as being oblique from the front backwards in the same direction as the long axis of an oblique gall bladder, these lateral views showed that, whilst the infundibulum may continue in the same direction as the long axis of the gall bladder, the same does not apply to the neck and cystic duct. They run from behind forwards and almost always in the direction of feet to head of the subject. Very rarely the neck is directed from head to foot. In addition, and once again contrary to Lukens description, the common bile duct is not the most posterior of the parts of the biliary tree. It is the infundibulocervical region which is the most inclined, regardless of the type of gall bladder. These lateral views also made it possible to demonstrate the pathognomic appearances of hypotonic and hypertonix hepatic/bile ducts and the antero-posterior projecting movements of the main bile duct.   \n",

A full field (360 degrees) flight simulator projection system was used to investigate the sensations resulting from pitch, roll, and yaw stimuli at various head orientations. Steady yaw rate (circularvection) and development of a constant roll tilt angle, for the head erect and constant velocity yaw and roll stimuli, confirmed previous reports. Pitch stimuli also were found to produce a sensation of tilting to a steady pitch angle, which was much stronger for pitch forward than backward. Pitch and roll effects were strongly dependent on head position, increasing for the head rolled 90 degrees to the side or inverted, and decreasing for the head pitched 25 degrees forward. These results support a hypothesis that visually induced tilt is limited by conflict with otolith information.   \n",

Since positional nystagmus may be difficult to evoke and may be elicited at one time and not at another, it is important to make repeated tests, lest a causative lesion be overlooked. Vertigo in such cases may be caused by pathologic change in the eighth peripheral nerve or in the central vestibular pathways. Sometimes no organic disease is observable even though positional nystagmus validates a complaint of vertigo. In such instances the patient should be assured that he does not have a progressive disease and be advised against activity in which dizziness would be hazardous.   \n",

              "20      reallife car crashes are often preceded by an evasive maneuver which can alter the occupant posture and muscle state to simulate the occupant response in such maneuvers human body models hbms with active muscles have been developed the aim of this study was to implement an omnidirectional rotational headneck muscle controller in the safer hbm and compare the biofidelity of the hbm with a rotational controller to the hbm with a translational controller in simulations of evasive maneuvers   the rotational controller was developed using an axisangle representation of head rotations with x y and z components in the axis muscle load sharing was based on rotational direction in the simulation and muscle activity recorded in three volunteer experiments in these directions the gains of the rotational and translational controller were tuned to minimize differences between translational and rotational head displacements of the hbm and volunteers in braking and lane change maneuvers using multiobjective optimizations biofidelity of the model with tuned controllers was evaluated objectively using correlation and analysis cora   the results indicated comparable performance for both controllers after tuning with somewhat higher biofidelity for rotational kinematics with the translational controller after tuning good or excellent biofidelity was indicated for both controllers in the loading direction forward in braking and lateral in lane change with cora scores of  and  for the rotational and translational controllers respectively for rotational displacements and translational displacements in the other directions biofidelity ranged from poor to excellent with slightly higher average cora scores for the hbm with the translational controller in both braking and lane changing timeaveraged muscle activity was within one standard deviation of timeaveraged muscle activity from volunteers   overall the results show that when tuned both the translational and rotational controllers can be used to predict the occupant response to an evasive maneuver allowing for the inclusion of evasive maneuvers prior to a crash in evaluation of vehicle safety the rotational controller shows potential in controlling omnidirectional head displacements but the translational controller outperformed the rotational controller thus for now the recommendation is to use the translational controller with tuned gains   \n",

We often encounter patients whose symptoms, including impaired forward vision and neck pain, deteriorate while walking. This is the first report of a case of dynamic spinal alignment change in a patient with DHS during walking using three-dimensional gait analysis. A 78-year-old Japanese woman complained of impaired forward vision and neck pain while walking. Her radiograph showed severe cervical kyphosis. C2-C7 SVA was +74 mm and C7-S1 SVA was -18.4 mm. The patient attempted to compensate to improve forward vision through lumbar hyperlordosis. We analyzed the gait motion of the patient by using three-dimensional (3D) motion and wireless surface electromyographic analysis systems to measure two systems synchronously. The patient walked continuously for as long as possible. We calculated dynamic SVA from the 3D motion analysis. Her head drop deformity gradually progressed and interfered with her forward vision while walking. Cervical SVA gradually increased from 75 to 85 mm. Thoracic SVA, Lumbar SVA and Whole spine SVA were initially decreased because of compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis, but ultimately increased, suggesting decompensation by the time she had finished walking. EMG activity of the bilateral trapezius muscles gradually reduced, which reflected the disturbance of maintaining her posture. Previous static evaluation could not prove the dynamic change of spinal alignment and EMG activity during walking. By introducing 3D gait analysis, we could evaluate dynamic spinal alignment of a patient with DHS.\",\n          \"[Purpose] To characterize the case report evidence of Chiropractic BioPhysics\\u00ae (CBP\\u00ae) technique methods applied to increase cervical lordosis and improve forward head posture. [Methods] The CBP Non-profit website as well as PubMed and Index to Chiropractic literature were searched for case reports/series documenting the increase of cervical lordosis and improvement of forward head posture in the treatment of various craniocervical spinal disorders by CBP technique methods. [Results] Sixty patients were reported in 41 unique manuscripts detailing the improvement in cervical spine alignment by CBP technique methods. On average, there was a 14\\u00b0 improvement in cervical lordosis and a 12 mm reduction in forward head position after 40 treatments over 16 weeks with a 5-point reduction in pain rating scores. Thirty-eight percent of cases included follow-up showing only slight loss of lordosis, but maintenance of pain and disability improvements after an average of 1.5 treatments per month for 1.8 years. [Conclusion] An abundance of reports document improvement in craniocervical and other ailments by CBP methods that increase cervical lordosis. Routine radiographic imaging of the spine is recommended as it is safe and the only current practical method of screening for critical biomechanical biomarkers of sagittal spine alignment.\",\n          \"Opium smoking has been a common practice in Iran for many years, with people often smoking for long hours. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in opium smoking due to false beliefs about its protective effects against COVID-19 infection. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between the non-ergonomic positions associated with traditional opium smoking in Iran and the development of neck pain and disability, forward head posture (FHP), and hyperkyphosis (HK). In this cross-sectional, correlational study, a total of 120 individuals who smoked opium were selected based on the inclusion criteria. They were interviewed about their addiction profile using the Lite version of the Addiction Severity Index and the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire. The presence of neck pain and disability was also evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale and the Neck Disability Index. The participants were examined for FHP via side-view photography and for HK using a flexible ruler. Data were analyzed using correlation coefficient tests and stepwise linear regression analysis. Based on the results, homelessness, the lifetime duration of opium smoking (in months), the duration of daily opium smoking (in minutes), and the severity of drug dependence had significant relationships with the severity of neck pain, neck disability, FHP, and HK. Homelessness was the strongest predictor of neck pain and disability (R2 = 0.367, p < 0.001), FHP (R2 = 0.457, p < 0.001), and HK (R2 = 0.476, p < 0.001), followed by the lifetime duration of opium smoking and the duration of daily opium smoking, respectively, in which R2 increased to 0.505 (p = 0.011), 0.546 (p = 0.022), and 0.570 (p = 0.004) with the addition of two other variables. Overall, an increase in the duration of sitting in non-ergonomic positions could lead to neck pain and disability, FHP, and HK due to the non-neutral posture of opium smokers.\"\n        ],\n

              "      <td>Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p &lt; 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.</td>\n",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of jaw and neck pain on craniocervico- mandibular functions and postural stability in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs).\\nMethods: Fifty-two patients with TMJDs were included and assessed using Fonseca's Questionnaire and the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index. An isometric strength test was performed for the TMJ depressor and cervical muscles. The TMJ position sense (TMJPS) test and cervical joint position error test (CJPET) were employed for proprioception. Total sway degree was obtained for the assessment of postural stability. Deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE) was assessed using the craniocervical flexion test. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was employed to assess mandibular function, and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured for forward head posture.\\nResults: Jaw and neck pain negatively affected CVA (R2 = 0.130), TMJPS (R2 = 0.286), DNFE (R2 = 0.355), TMJ depressor (R2 = 0.145), cervical flexor (R2 = 0.144), and extensor (R2 = 0.148) muscle strength. Jaw and neck pain also positively affected CJPET for flexion (R2 = 0.116) and extension (R2 = 0.146), as well as total sway degree (R2 = 0.128) and MFIQ (R2 = 0.230).\\nConclusions: Patients with painful TMJDs, could have impaired muscle strength and proprioception of the TMJ and cervical region. The jaw and neck pain could also affect postural stability, and the endurance of deep neck flexors as well as mandibular functions in TMJDs.</td>\n",

It is conceivable that relative lengths of the cervical column might influence population differences in craniocervical posture and craniofacial morphology. The present study aimed to elucidate this relationship by comparing head posture and craniofacial morphology in Australian aboriginals to the same features in a previously studied sample of 120 Danish students (Solow and Tallgren, 1976). The aboriginal sample consisted of 42 young male adults from the Yuendumu settlement, Northern Territory, Australia. Cephalometric films of the natural head position were taken during a field trip to the settlement. The comparison comprised 18 postural and 61 morphological variables. In the aboriginals, the cervical column was shorter and had a less pronounced lordosis. The head was held about 3 degrees lower, and the upper cervical column was 8 1/2 degrees more forward inclined. As a consequence, the craniocervical angle was about 6 degrees larger. Comparison of the craniofacial morphology in the two groups showed in the aboriginals a shorter upper facial height, a larger anterior lower facial height, and a larger vertical jaw relationship (NL/ML). The length of the posterior cranial base, s-ba, was 4 mm shorter (P less than 0.001) in the aboriginals, possibly developmentally related to the generally shorter spinal column in Australian aboriginals.</td>\n",

A forward drawn head position producing static overstrain in the posterior neck muscles and compensatory retroflexion of the cranio-cervical junction resulting in blockage in this region. 3. Anteflexion and ligament pain mainly due to faulty position at work and jolting. 4. Static disturbance in the frontal plain due to obliquity producing asymmetrical strain in the neck musculature. 5. Increased muscular tension due to psychological stress. 6. Blockage in the regions of the cervical spine, shoulder girdle and upper ribs with reflex muscular spasm. 7. Reflex spasm of the neck musculature in visceral disorders causing in addition blockage of the cervico-thoracic junction (heart, gall bladder). 8.

              "0     Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p < 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.   \n",

The participants were assessed based on age, gender, dominant side, the amount of time they spent on their smartphones, the purpose of their use, and their posture. The Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Form (SAS-SF) was used to determine addictes and non-addicts. The cut-off value of SAS-SF is 31 and above for male and 33 and above for female.\\nResults: There were 136 participants in the study. The posture score for addicts and non-addicts ones was not significantly different (p > 0,05), but the number of trigger points, maximal bending posture and trigger points in the right levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles were significantly higher in the smartphone addict participants (p < 0,05).\\nConclusions: Smartphone addiction in university students is associated with postural changes and trigger points in the bilateral levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles. Public health programs should be developed to raise awareness about smartphone addiction, encourage screen breaks, and emphasize physical activity and exercise regularly.   \n",

A total of sixty-six eligible participants with chronic neck pain and forward head posture were randomized into the Myofascial Release Therapy (MRT) group (n = 33) and MRT and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) group (n = 33). Clinical outcomes included neck pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale, neck disability measured through the neck disability index, and forward head posture measured through the cranial vertebral angle. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and the four and eight weeks after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain intensity, CVA, and neck disability after the intervention. However, the CBT group demonstrated greater improvements than the MRT group. The difference in outcomes between the groups was statistically significant. Myofascial Release Therapy combined with CBT is an effective treatment method for patients with chronic neck pain and forward head posture.   \n",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of jaw and neck pain on craniocervico- mandibular functions and postural stability in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs).\\nMethods: Fifty-two patients with TMJDs were included and assessed using Fonseca's Questionnaire and the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index. An isometric strength test was performed for the TMJ depressor and cervical muscles. The TMJ position sense (TMJPS) test and cervical joint position error test (CJPET) were employed for proprioception. Total sway degree was obtained for the assessment of postural stability. Deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE) was assessed using the craniocervical flexion test. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was employed to assess mandibular function, and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured for forward head posture.\\nResults: Jaw and neck pain negatively affected CVA (R2 = 0.130), TMJPS (R2 = 0.286), DNFE (R2 = 0.355), TMJ depressor (R2 = 0.145), cervical flexor (R2 = 0.144), and extensor (R2 = 0.148) muscle strength. Jaw and neck pain also positively affected CJPET for flexion (R2 = 0.116) and extension (R2 = 0.146), as well as total sway degree (R2 = 0.128) and MFIQ (R2 = 0.230).\\nConclusions: Patients with painful TMJDs, could have impaired muscle strength and proprioception of the TMJ and cervical region. The jaw and neck pain could also affect postural stability, and the endurance of deep neck flexors as well as mandibular functions in TMJDs.   \n",

These changes in muscular and connective tissues can impair cervical spine stability and contribute to developing neck pain symptoms. In this experiment, change in the cervical spine stability associated with a sustained smartphone use posture was evaluated by quantifying the effective stiffness and the reflexive responses of the head to sudden perturbations. Seventeen young smartphone users maintained their heads tilted forward approximately 30° for 30 min while watching videos on their smartphones in sitting. Data show that the measures of cervical spine stability did not change significantly after the smartphone use task despite developing mild to moderate neck and upper body discomfort symptoms. Study findings imply that keeping the head tilt posture for 30 min for smartphone use did not significantly alter spinal stability, rejecting its association with neck discomfort.   \n",

Comparative values have been obtained which may promote evaluation of pathological changes within the cervical spine. Some correlations have been found between the range of active motions and the force in the following motions: backward bending, head bending to the right, head bending to the left. It has been also observed that the difference between the mean force during forward bending and the mean force during backward bending is statistically significant at the significance level of 0.95.   \n",

It is conceivable that relative lengths of the cervical column might influence population differences in craniocervical posture and craniofacial morphology. The present study aimed to elucidate this relationship by comparing head posture and craniofacial morphology in Australian aboriginals to the same features in a previously studied sample of 120 Danish students (Solow and Tallgren, 1976). The aboriginal sample consisted of 42 young male adults from the Yuendumu settlement, Northern Territory, Australia. Cephalometric films of the natural head position were taken during a field trip to the settlement. The comparison comprised 18 postural and 61 morphological variables. In the aboriginals, the cervical column was shorter and had a less pronounced lordosis. The head was held about 3 degrees lower, and the upper cervical column was 8 1/2 degrees more forward inclined. As a consequence, the craniocervical angle was about 6 degrees larger. Comparison of the craniofacial morphology in the two groups showed in the aboriginals a shorter upper facial height, a larger anterior lower facial height, and a larger vertical jaw relationship (NL/ML). The length of the posterior cranial base, s-ba, was 4 mm shorter (P less than 0.001) in the aboriginals, possibly developmentally related to the generally shorter spinal column in Australian aboriginals.   \n",

In many of these increased tension of the neck musculature plays an important role. The following mechanisms underlying headache are described and differentiated: 1. Headache due to faulty muscle pattern (stereotype) resulting in overstrain of the upper fixators of the shoulder girdle (upper part of the m.trapezius and levator scapulae); faulty respiration with the aid of the upper auxillary muscles even at rest is pointed out. 2. A forward drawn head position producing static overstrain in the posterior neck muscles and compensatory retroflexion of the cranio-cervical junction resulting in blockage in this region. 3. Anteflexion and ligament pain mainly due to faulty position at work and jolting. 4. Static disturbance in the frontal plain due to obliquity producing asymmetrical strain in the neck musculature. 5. Increased muscular tension due to psychological stress. 6. Blockage in the regions of the cervical spine, shoulder girdle and upper ribs with reflex muscular spasm. 7. Reflex spasm of the neck musculature in visceral disorders causing in addition blockage of the cervico-thoracic junction (heart, gall bladder). 8. Pain arising from the posterior arch of the atlas (here described for the first time). 9. Headache due to vertebral artery involvement. The type of headache seems to be determined rather by the individual mode of reaction than by the mechanism underlying it. As a rule a combination of mechanisms is actually found.   \n",

This hypothesis is examined in the light of the clinical evidence provided by the symptomatology and treatment of 19 consecutive cases of intracranial mass lesions exhibiting truncal ataxia.   \n",

This lesion, untreated, may result in damage to the spinal cord, paresis or sudden death. Occipital headache, present in 13 of 22 patients, was often aggravated by working with the head in forward flexion. Paresthesias were present in six patients. The spine of the axis was often prominent. In three patients there was objective evidence of cord compression with sensory and/or pyramidal signs. In eight the lesion was asymptomatic and discovered by routine lateral radiography in flexion, the position of maximum subluxation.Conservative treatment involved the continuous use of a cervical collar to limit neck flexion. This usually relieved subjective symptoms including headaches. Successful surgical fixation was performed in two individuals. Surgical indications included acute or chronic cord compression or severe symptoms unrelieved by a collar.   \n",

              "      <td>Background: Forward head posture and rounded shoulder posture are common postural variants found in upper crossed syndrome, which can lead to limited neck mobility, respiratory problems, and other issues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p &lt; 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for the Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the telerehabilitation training group, which included diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, was more effective in improving Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD in males with UCS.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Objective: This study aimed to compare sensory organization test and postural control strategies between individuals with mild and moderate-to-severe forward head posture (FHP).\\nMethods: A sensory organization test (SOT) was performed in 6 conditions using computerized dynamic posturography, to assess postural control. Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P &lt; .05) and strategy scores (P &lt; .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P &lt; .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P &gt; .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Forward Head Posture (FHP) is one of the most commonly occurring musculoskeletal abnormalities. Despite exercise therapy being an effective approach for FHP treatment, it can be long, monotonous, and tedious. Virtual reality (VR) can be used as an innovative solution to address these challenges. We designed an affordable and immersive VR-based exercise therapy (VRET) system for FHP correction. The VRET contents (i.e., exercises and VR scenarios) were determined by physiotherapists and game designers at the focus group meetings. Hardware requirements include a VR box, smartphone, and sensors (i.e., a smartphone accelerometer and an affordable Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)) to measure head motions and transfer them via Wi-Fi to the VRET system. The IMU was designed using the MPU6050, Arduino Nano, and ESP8266-01S. Gwet's AC1, Game Experience Questionnaires (GEQ), and System Usability Scale (SUS) were used to measure intra-rater reliability, user experience, and system usability, respectively. The determined exercises, including Capital Flexion-Extension and Chin Tuck, were designed in the form of a shooting game. A physiotherapist and twenty-one FHP individuals took part in evaluating the system. High precision was obtained for the designed IMU (i.e., pitch and roll &lt; 0.1° and yaw &lt; 1.3 °). Gwet's AC1 and SUS results showed very good intra-rater reliability (coefficient = 0.892) and excellent usability (score = 87.14), respectively. According to the mean scores of the GEQ, participants were confident about competence, immersion, flow, and positive affect components.

              "      <td>Maternal treatment with methylmercury (MeHg) has been shown to induce a high frequency of cleft palate and produce growth retardation in rat and mouse fetuses, but the relation between these effects is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if mandibular growth retardation was a factor that contributed to induction of cleft palate in C57BL/6J mice. Two doses of MeHg (10 mg/kg maternal body weight) were given subcutaneously on days 10 and 11 of gestation, and the fetuses were morphometrically studied on days 14, 15, and 18. Full clefts of the secondary palate were present in approximately half of the treated day 15 and 18 fetuses; therefore, the cleft palate (CP) and noncleft palate (NCP) groups were analyzed separately to facilitate identification of morphologic changes associated with the clefting. The results showed that, compared with controls, the day 14 MeHg-treated fetuses had significantly smaller placental weights, but only half of the fetuses had delayed palatal shelf elevation, reduced body weight, and delayed morphological development. However on day 15, the CP and the NCP groups had similar reductions in body weight and placental weight. A striking downward and forward positioning of the head was present in the MeHg-treated fetuses with the CP group more severely affected than the NCP group. Significant differences between the three groups (control, NCP, and CP) were present with mean head-to-body angles of 67 degrees, 60 degrees and 51 degrees, respectively. The absence of normal head lifting resulted in a relative mandibular retrognathia that when combined with a decrease in mandibular length produced alterations in spatial relations that were most severe in the CP fetuses. The results suggest that after exposure to MeHg, palatal closure is affected by altered tongue posture associated with the abnormal head positioning and shortening of the mandible that develop following placental and embryonic growth retardation.</td>\n",

When a 60 sec BH or FI was performed while leaning forward, there was a significant linear correlation between the maximal bradycardial response (delta HRmax) and ambient pressure for simple BH (r-0.08, P less than 0.05) and 31 degrees C FI (r = 0.91, P less than 0.01), but not for 27 degrees C FI. A similar trend was seen during 30 sec BH's while seated erect. The facial cold-dependent component of the FI bradycardia was not significantly altered by pressure. In general, there were significant correlations between the initial HR and the initial thoracic conductive volume (TCV; measured by the four-electrode Minnesota impedance cardiograph), and between the initial TCV and delta HRmax observed during seated erect BH's. Since the TCV was generally higher at depth, it is suggested that a mechanical effect due to increased TCV at depth, possibly related to increased gas density, is at least partly responsible for the pressure dependence of BH bradycardia.</td>\n",

              "      <td>A simplified test for anterolateral rotary subluxation of the knee is largely based on the concepts described by Galway and McIntosh although performed in a different manner. The examiner places the right hand gently on the lateral side of the knee with the thumb overlying the posterior aspect of the fibula and the index finger palpating the anterolateral aspect of the joint line to determine the the tibiofemoral relationship. The left hand embraces the lateral side of the distal end of the femur with the thumb over the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. With equal pressure on the lateral femoral condyle and fibular head the knee is pushed gently forward into flexion. When anterointernal tibial luxation is present, a reduction phenomenon is felt as the knee passes into the 25 to 40 degree flexion range. This may occur as a sudden palpable and occasionally audible repositioning which is responsible for such terminology as a \"pivot shift\" or \"jerk sign.\" We have experienced many instances where the reduction phenomenon is more subtle and is determined by palpation alone. The pathologic mechanics are determined by observations at surgery in 45 patients with a positive test. This test has improved our diagnositc ability and is easly taught to those unfamiliar with knee joint disorders.</td>\n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj < 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj < 0.05/4) for the Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the telerehabilitation training group, which included diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, was more effective in improving Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD in males with UCS.   \n",

Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P < .05) and strategy scores (P < .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P < .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P > .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.   \n",

Despite exercise therapy being an effective approach for FHP treatment, it can be long, monotonous, and tedious. Virtual reality (VR) can be used as an innovative solution to address these challenges. We designed an affordable and immersive VR-based exercise therapy (VRET) system for FHP correction. The VRET contents (i.e., exercises and VR scenarios) were determined by physiotherapists and game designers at the focus group meetings. Hardware requirements include a VR box, smartphone, and sensors (i.e., a smartphone accelerometer and an affordable Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)) to measure head motions and transfer them via Wi-Fi to the VRET system. The IMU was designed using the MPU6050, Arduino Nano, and ESP8266-01S. Gwet's AC1, Game Experience Questionnaires (GEQ), and System Usability Scale (SUS) were used to measure intra-rater reliability, user experience, and system usability, respectively. The determined exercises, including Capital Flexion-Extension and Chin Tuck, were designed in the form of a shooting game. A physiotherapist and twenty-one FHP individuals took part in evaluating the system. High precision was obtained for the designed IMU (i.e., pitch and roll < 0.1° and yaw < 1.3 °). Gwet's AC1 and SUS results showed very good intra-rater reliability (coefficient = 0.892) and excellent usability (score = 87.14), respectively. According to the mean scores of the GEQ, participants were confident about competence, immersion, flow, and positive affect components. The development of low-cost VRET systems for FHP correction is a step towards facilitating rehabilitation challenges by providing positive experiences for users as well as helping them perform therapeutic exercises correctly.   \n",

Thus, this study investigated the effects of FHP on neck and ankle joint position sense, and conducted a comparison between the joint position sense of the right and left ankle.\\nMethods: Fifty-seven subjects were assigned according to the craniovertebral angle (CVA) into the FHP group (CVA <49°; n = 27) or the control group (CVA >49°; n = 30). Head and ankle joint repositioning accuracy was measured by using a cervical range-of-motion device and an isokinetic dynamometer, respectively.\\nResults: There was a significant increase in the joint position error (JPE) of the cervical flexion, extension, and right and left side bending motions of the FHP group compared to the control group (P < .05). There were significant increases in the JPE of the right and left ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the FHP group compared to the healthy group (P < .05). Moreover, the JPE of the right ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the FHP group were significantly higher than the left ankle (P < .05).\\nConclusions: The FHP decreases the position sense of cervical flexion, extension, and right and left side bending motions, and the plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of both ankle joints, especially the right ankle joint.   \n",

STEG included progressive strengthening, proprioceptive, and stabilization exercises. All participants were assessed before treatment, at the end of the 8th week treatment period and at the 12th week post-treatment follow-up. Cranio-vertebral angle measurement, Fonseca's Questionnaire, Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index, TMJ position test, cervical joint position error test and postural stability assessment were used.\\nResults: The TMJ and cervical joint position sense, total sway degree, area gap percentage, sway velocity and antero-posterior body sway results showed significant improvement in the STEG compared to the CG (p< 0.05), however medio-lateral body sway did not differ between groups (p> 0.05).\\nConclusions: Postural stability, TMJ and cervical joint position sense appear to be affected in individuals with CCM malalignment. Our results showed that an exercise program including ST stabilization, proprioception and strengthening of the scapular muscles may be effective in the management of CCM malalignment and will allow clinicians to plan holistic treatment.   \n",

              "1222  Maternal treatment with methylmercury (MeHg) has been shown to induce a high frequency of cleft palate and produce growth retardation in rat and mouse fetuses, but the relation between these effects is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if mandibular growth retardation was a factor that contributed to induction of cleft palate in C57BL/6J mice. Two doses of MeHg (10 mg/kg maternal body weight) were given subcutaneously on days 10 and 11 of gestation, and the fetuses were morphometrically studied on days 14, 15, and 18. Full clefts of the secondary palate were present in approximately half of the treated day 15 and 18 fetuses; therefore, the cleft palate (CP) and noncleft palate (NCP) groups were analyzed separately to facilitate identification of morphologic changes associated with the clefting. The results showed that, compared with controls, the day 14 MeHg-treated fetuses had significantly smaller placental weights, but only half of the fetuses had delayed palatal shelf elevation, reduced body weight, and delayed morphological development. However on day 15, the CP and the NCP groups had similar reductions in body weight and placental weight. A striking downward and forward positioning of the head was present in the MeHg-treated fetuses with the CP group more severely affected than the NCP group. Significant differences between the three groups (control, NCP, and CP) were present with mean head-to-body angles of 67 degrees, 60 degrees and 51 degrees, respectively. The absence of normal head lifting resulted in a relative mandibular retrognathia that when combined with a decrease in mandibular length produced alterations in spatial relations that were most severe in the CP fetuses. The results suggest that after exposure to MeHg, palatal closure is affected by altered tongue posture associated with the abnormal head positioning and shortening of the mandible that develop following placental and embryonic growth retardation.   \n",

Preoperatively, patients with rheumatoid arthritis functioned at lower levels than patients with osteoarthritis. Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis improved steadily after surgery, while progress of those with osteoarthritis was often irregular. The group with rheumatoid arthritis improved more than those with osteoarthritis, but they did not generally reach the functional level attained by the patients with osteoarthritis, and neither group reached the lower limits of normal variability 1 year postoperatively. On the average, both groups gained knee extensions, lost knee flexion, and gained isometric knee flexor muscle strength postoperatively. Every patient with osteoarthritis lost extensor muscle strength 1 year after surgery, while most with rheumatoid arthritis gained. During quiet standing, most patients had straighter knees postoperatively and bore a greater percent of body weight on the operated limb. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis improved more than patients with osteoarthritis in the type and amount of force applied to canes and crutches. Most patients walked faster postoperatively, took longer and more rapid steps, improved the pattern of knee motion used, and had smoother forward, lateral and vertical head motion.   \n",

When a 60 sec BH or FI was performed while leaning forward, there was a significant linear correlation between the maximal bradycardial response (delta HRmax) and ambient pressure for simple BH (r-0.08, P less than 0.05) and 31 degrees C FI (r = 0.91, P less than 0.01), but not for 27 degrees C FI. A similar trend was seen during 30 sec BH's while seated erect. The facial cold-dependent component of the FI bradycardia was not significantly altered by pressure. In general, there were significant correlations between the initial HR and the initial thoracic conductive volume (TCV; measured by the four-electrode Minnesota impedance cardiograph), and between the initial TCV and delta HRmax observed during seated erect BH's. Since the TCV was generally higher at depth, it is suggested that a mechanical effect due to increased TCV at depth, possibly related to increased gas density, is at least partly responsible for the pressure dependence of BH bradycardia.   \n",

The examiner places the right hand gently on the lateral side of the knee with the thumb overlying the posterior aspect of the fibula and the index finger palpating the anterolateral aspect of the joint line to determine the the tibiofemoral relationship. The left hand embraces the lateral side of the distal end of the femur with the thumb over the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. With equal pressure on the lateral femoral condyle and fibular head the knee is pushed gently forward into flexion. When anterointernal tibial luxation is present, a reduction phenomenon is felt as the knee passes into the 25 to 40 degree flexion range. This may occur as a sudden palpable and occasionally audible repositioning which is responsible for such terminology as a \"pivot shift\" or \"jerk sign.\" We have experienced many instances where the reduction phenomenon is more subtle and is determined by palpation alone. The pathologic mechanics are determined by observations at surgery in 45 patients with a positive test. This test has improved our diagnositc ability and is easly taught to those unfamiliar with knee joint disorders.   \n",

              "1222  maternal treatment with methylmercury mehg has been shown to induce a high frequency of cleft palate and produce growth retardation in rat and mouse fetuses but the relation between these effects is unknown the objective of this study was to determine if mandibular growth retardation was a factor that contributed to induction of cleft palate in cblj mice two doses of mehg  mgkg maternal body weight were given subcutaneously on days  and  of gestation and the fetuses were morphometrically studied on days   and  full clefts of the secondary palate were present in approximately half of the treated day  and  fetuses therefore the cleft palate cp and noncleft palate ncp groups were analyzed separately to facilitate identification of morphologic changes associated with the clefting the results showed that compared with controls the day  mehgtreated fetuses had significantly smaller placental weights but only half of the fetuses had delayed palatal shelf elevation reduced body weight and delayed morphological development however on day  the cp and the ncp groups had similar reductions in body weight and placental weight a striking downward and forward positioning of the head was present in the mehgtreated fetuses with the cp group more severely affected than the ncp group significant differences between the three groups control ncp and cp were present with mean headtobody angles of  degrees  degrees and  degrees respectively the absence of normal head lifting resulted in a relative mandibular retrognathia that when combined with a decrease in mandibular length produced alterations in spatial relations that were most severe in the cp fetuses the results suggest that after exposure to mehg palatal closure is affected by altered tongue posture associated with the abnormal head positioning and shortening of the mandible that develop following placental and embryonic growth retardation   \n",
