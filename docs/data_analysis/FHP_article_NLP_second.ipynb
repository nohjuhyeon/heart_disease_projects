       "      <td>Background:Forward head posture (FHP) and altered cervical lordotic curvatures are common spine displacements often associated with neck pain and disability. Two primary categories for determining FHP exist: radiographic and postural measurements.Methods:This study investigated the correlation between the craniovertebral angle (CVA), the radiographically measured C2–C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and cervical lordosis (absolute rotation angle: ARA C2–C7) in a sample of participants with chronic myofascial pain (CMP). In 120 participants, we performed both a postural measurement of the CVA and a lateral cervical radiograph, where the C2–C7 SVA and ARA C2–C7 were measured. A linear-regression Rvalue to assess the correlation between the CVA, C2–C7 SVA, and ARA C2–C7 was sought.Results:A statistically significant weak linear fit was identified (Spearman’s r = 0.549; R= 0.30,p&lt; 0.001) between the CVA and C2–C7 SVA, having considerable variation between the two measures. A statistically significant linear fit (very weak) was identified for the lordosis ARA C2–C7 and the CVA: Spearman’s r = 0.524; R= 0.275;p&lt; 0.001. A value of 50° for the CVA corresponded to a value of 20 mm for the C2–C7 SVA on an X-ray.Conclusion:While the CVA and radiographic C2–C7 SVA are weakly correlated in an individual, they seem to represent different aspects of sagittal cervical balance. The CVA cannot replace radiographically measured cervical lordosis. We recommend that more emphasis be given to radiographic measures of sagittal cervical alignment than the CVA when considering patient interventions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: Neck and jaw pain is common and is associated with jaw functional limitations, postural stability, muscular endurance, and proprioception. This study aimed to investigate the effect of jaw and neck pain on craniocervico- mandibular functions and postural stability in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs).\\nMethods: Fifty-two patients with TMJDs were included and assessed using Fonseca's Questionnaire and the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index. An isometric strength test was performed for the TMJ depressor and cervical muscles. The TMJ position sense (TMJPS) test and cervical joint position error test (CJPET) were employed for proprioception. Total sway degree was obtained for the assessment of postural stability. Deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE) was assessed using the craniocervical flexion test. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was employed to assess mandibular function, and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured for forward head posture.\\nResults: Jaw and neck pain negatively affected CVA (R2 = 0.130), TMJPS (R2 = 0.286), DNFE (R2 = 0.355), TMJ depressor (R2 = 0.145), cervical flexor (R2 = 0.144), and extensor (R2 = 0.148) muscle strength. Jaw and neck pain also positively affected CJPET for flexion (R2 = 0.116) and extension (R2 = 0.146), as well as total sway degree (R2 = 0.128) and MFIQ (R2 = 0.230).\\nConclusions: Patients with painful TMJDs, could have impaired muscle strength and proprioception of the TMJ and cervical region. The jaw and neck pain could also affect postural stability, and the endurance of deep neck flexors as well as mandibular functions in TMJDs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Stroke is a significant health problem that may result in long-term functional deficits. Balance and walking problems are among the most common post-stroke deficits, and they may negatively affect quality of life. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of cervical mobilization on balance and gait parameters after stroke. Participants were 24 adults (aged 30–65 years), who scored 24 or above on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and no more than 3 on the Modified Rankin scale. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental Bobath therapy and cervical mobilization group (n = 12) or a control group who received Bobath therapy and a sham application (n = 12). Both groups received 60 minutes of Bobath therapy three times a week for four weeks; additionally, the experimental group received 15 minutes of cervical mobilization in each session, while the control group received 15 minutes of spinal sham mobilization each session. Pre and post treatment, we assessed all participants’ demographic characteristics, gait parameters, balance parameters, and forward head posture values using a clinical data assessment form, spatiotemporal gait analysis (LEGSystm), portable computerized kinesthetic balance device (SportKAT 550), and craniovertebral angle (CVA), respectively. The groups showed no significant differences in their initial demographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, stroke duration and disability levels.). In comparing changes on variables of interest, we observed significant experimental versus control group improvements in balance parameters except for their left side balance score (right side, left side, forward, backward and total balance scores were significant at p = .003, p = .089, p &lt; .001, p = .022, p &lt; .001, respectively), gait parameters (stride number, stride length, stride time, stride velocity, cadance at p = .007, p = .019, p = .013, p = .005, p = .001, respectively) and CVA (p &lt; .001). Also, there were findings in favor of the experimental group on the modified timed up and go test on walk out, mid turn, walk back and total times (p = .028, p = .001, p = .016, and p = .001, respectively),but not for sit-to-stand time or stand-to-sit time. Clinicians involved in stroke rehabilitation should assess and treat the cervical region to enhance rehabilitation effectiveness.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Changes in upper body posture, colloquially termed forward head posture (FHP), are considered to be an etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). The literature suggests that postural deviations associated with FHP follow distinct patterns involving an increase in the thoracic kyphosis angle and a downwardly rotated, anteriorly tilted, and protracted scapula, which in turn leads to increased compression in the subacromial space. These postural changes are thought to occur concurrently with an imbalance of the musculature, and conservative rehabilitation commonly involves addressing both posture and muscle imbalance. There is a paucity of evidence supporting the hypothesis that posture and muscle imbalance are involved in the etiology of SIS. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether FHP was associated with an increased thoracic kyphosis, an altered position of the scapula; and a reduction in glenohumeral elevation range. Selected sagittal and frontal plane postural measurements were made in 60 asymptomatic subjects and 60 subjects with SIS. The findings suggested that upper body posture does not follow the set patterns described in the literature, and further research is required to determine whether upper body and scapular posture and muscle imbalance are involved in the pathogenesis of SIS.\\nFrom MEDLINE®/PubMed®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine</td>\n",

       "      <td>Poor trunk posture, especially during long periods of sitting, could lead to problems such as Low Back Pain (LBP) and Forward Head Posture (FHP). Typical solutions are based on visual or vibration-based feedback. However, these systems could lead to feedback being ignored by the user and phantom vibration syndrome, respectively. In this study, we propose using haptic feedback for postural adaptation. In this two-part study, twenty-four healthy participants (age 25.87 ± 2.17 years) adapted to three different postural targets in the anterior direction while performing a unimanual reaching task using a robotic device. Results suggest a strong adaptation to the desired postural targets. Mean anterior trunk bending after the intervention is significantly different compared to baseline measurements for all postural targets. Additional analysis of movement straightness and smoothness indicates an absence of any negative interference of posture-based feedback on the performance of reaching movement. Taken together, these results suggest that haptic feedback-based systems could be used for postural adaptation applications. Also, this type of postural adaptation system can be used during the rehabilitation of stroke patients to reduce trunk compensation in lieu of typical physical constraint-based methods.</td>\n",

Two primary categories for determining FHP exist: radiographic and postural measurements.Methods:This study investigated the correlation between the craniovertebral angle (CVA), the radiographically measured C2–C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and cervical lordosis (absolute rotation angle: ARA C2–C7) in a sample of participants with chronic myofascial pain (CMP). In 120 participants, we performed both a postural measurement of the CVA and a lateral cervical radiograph, where the C2–C7 SVA and ARA C2–C7 were measured. A linear-regression Rvalue to assess the correlation between the CVA, C2–C7 SVA, and ARA C2–C7 was sought.Results:A statistically significant weak linear fit was identified (Spearman’s r = 0.549; R= 0.30,p< 0.001) between the CVA and C2–C7 SVA, having considerable variation between the two measures. A statistically significant linear fit (very weak) was identified for the lordosis ARA C2–C7 and the CVA: Spearman’s r = 0.524; R= 0.275;p< 0.001. A value of 50° for the CVA corresponded to a value of 20 mm for the C2–C7 SVA on an X-ray.Conclusion:While the CVA and radiographic C2–C7 SVA are weakly correlated in an individual, they seem to represent different aspects of sagittal cervical balance. The CVA cannot replace radiographically measured cervical lordosis. We recommend that more emphasis be given to radiographic measures of sagittal cervical alignment than the CVA when considering patient interventions.  \n",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of jaw and neck pain on craniocervico- mandibular functions and postural stability in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs).\\nMethods: Fifty-two patients with TMJDs were included and assessed using Fonseca's Questionnaire and the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index. An isometric strength test was performed for the TMJ depressor and cervical muscles. The TMJ position sense (TMJPS) test and cervical joint position error test (CJPET) were employed for proprioception. Total sway degree was obtained for the assessment of postural stability. Deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE) was assessed using the craniocervical flexion test. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was employed to assess mandibular function, and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured for forward head posture.\\nResults: Jaw and neck pain negatively affected CVA (R2 = 0.130), TMJPS (R2 = 0.286), DNFE (R2 = 0.355), TMJ depressor (R2 = 0.145), cervical flexor (R2 = 0.144), and extensor (R2 = 0.148) muscle strength. Jaw and neck pain also positively affected CJPET for flexion (R2 = 0.116) and extension (R2 = 0.146), as well as total sway degree (R2 = 0.128) and MFIQ (R2 = 0.230).\\nConclusions: Patients with painful TMJDs, could have impaired muscle strength and proprioception of the TMJ and cervical region. The jaw and neck pain could also affect postural stability, and the endurance of deep neck flexors as well as mandibular functions in TMJDs.  \n",

Balance and walking problems are among the most common post-stroke deficits, and they may negatively affect quality of life. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of cervical mobilization on balance and gait parameters after stroke. Participants were 24 adults (aged 30–65 years), who scored 24 or above on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and no more than 3 on the Modified Rankin scale. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental Bobath therapy and cervical mobilization group (n = 12) or a control group who received Bobath therapy and a sham application (n = 12). Both groups received 60 minutes of Bobath therapy three times a week for four weeks; additionally, the experimental group received 15 minutes of cervical mobilization in each session, while the control group received 15 minutes of spinal sham mobilization each session. Pre and post treatment, we assessed all participants’ demographic characteristics, gait parameters, balance parameters, and forward head posture values using a clinical data assessment form, spatiotemporal gait analysis (LEGSystm), portable computerized kinesthetic balance device (SportKAT 550), and craniovertebral angle (CVA), respectively. The groups showed no significant differences in their initial demographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, stroke duration and disability levels.). In comparing changes on variables of interest, we observed significant experimental versus control group improvements in balance parameters except for their left side balance score (right side, left side, forward, backward and total balance scores were significant at p = .003, p = .089, p < .001, p = .022, p < .001, respectively), gait parameters (stride number, stride length, stride time, stride velocity, cadance at p = .007, p = .019, p = .013, p = .005, p = .001, respectively) and CVA (p < .001). Also, there were findings in favor of the experimental group on the modified timed up and go test on walk out, mid turn, walk back and total times (p = .028, p = .001, p = .016, and p = .001, respectively),but not for sit-to-stand time or stand-to-sit time. Clinicians involved in stroke rehabilitation should assess and treat the cervical region to enhance rehabilitation effectiveness.  \n",

The literature suggests that postural deviations associated with FHP follow distinct patterns involving an increase in the thoracic kyphosis angle and a downwardly rotated, anteriorly tilted, and protracted scapula, which in turn leads to increased compression in the subacromial space. These postural changes are thought to occur concurrently with an imbalance of the musculature, and conservative rehabilitation commonly involves addressing both posture and muscle imbalance. There is a paucity of evidence supporting the hypothesis that posture and muscle imbalance are involved in the etiology of SIS. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether FHP was associated with an increased thoracic kyphosis, an altered position of the scapula; and a reduction in glenohumeral elevation range. Selected sagittal and frontal plane postural measurements were made in 60 asymptomatic subjects and 60 subjects with SIS. The findings suggested that upper body posture does not follow the set patterns described in the literature, and further research is required to determine whether upper body and scapular posture and muscle imbalance are involved in the pathogenesis of SIS.\\nFrom MEDLINE®/PubMed®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine  \n",

Typical solutions are based on visual or vibration-based feedback. However, these systems could lead to feedback being ignored by the user and phantom vibration syndrome, respectively. In this study, we propose using haptic feedback for postural adaptation. In this two-part study, twenty-four healthy participants (age 25.87 ± 2.17 years) adapted to three different postural targets in the anterior direction while performing a unimanual reaching task using a robotic device. Results suggest a strong adaptation to the desired postural targets. Mean anterior trunk bending after the intervention is significantly different compared to baseline measurements for all postural targets. Additional analysis of movement straightness and smoothness indicates an absence of any negative interference of posture-based feedback on the performance of reaching movement. Taken together, these results suggest that haptic feedback-based systems could be used for postural adaptation applications. Also, this type of postural adaptation system can be used during the rehabilitation of stroke patients to reduce trunk compensation in lieu of typical physical constraint-based methods.  \n",

After the conditional statement operation is performed within the application, the vibration is output when the event processing is completed.\\nThe subjects of this study were selected from 30 subjects who showed forward head posture through Cranio Vertebral Angle(CVA) and Cranial Rotation Angle(CRA). Subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=15) and a control group (n=15). The experimental group was giver the cervical-retraction assistive tool and the control group was given the Stabilizer™. Intervention was performed 5 times a week for 6 weeks. CVA and CRA were measured again to investigate the change on neck alignment.\\nThe results showed that the pre- and post-exercise CVA and CRA were significantly differences in the experimental group and the control group. The Inter Quartile Range(IQR) of the difference between pre- and post-exercise CVA in the experimental group was 7.5 and it was 1.23 for the control group. The IQR of the difference between the pre- and post-exercise CRA of the experimental group was 8.19 and it was 1.28 for the control group. The change of CVA was 23.82% in the experimental group and it was 5.51% in the control group. The change of CRA was 5.19% in the experimental group and it was 2.35% in the control group.\\nIn conclusion, this study showed that the cervical-retraction assistive tool was effective in improving the alignment of the neck alignment of the forward head posture as well as Stabilizer™.  \n",

       "      <td>Background:Forward head posture (FHP) and altered cervical lordotic curvatures are common spine displacements often associated with neck pain and disability. Two primary categories for determining FHP exist: radiographic and postural measurements.Methods:This study investigated the correlation between the craniovertebral angle (CVA), the radiographically measured C2–C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and cervical lordosis (absolute rotation angle: ARA C2–C7) in a sample of participants with chronic myofascial pain (CMP). In 120 participants, we performed both a postural measurement of the CVA and a lateral cervical radiograph, where the C2–C7 SVA and ARA C2–C7 were measured. A linear-regression Rvalue to assess the correlation between the CVA, C2–C7 SVA, and ARA C2–C7 was sought.Results:A statistically significant weak linear fit was identified (Spearman’s r = 0.549; R= 0.30,p&lt; 0.001) between the CVA and C2–C7 SVA, having considerable variation between the two measures. A statistically significant linear fit (very weak) was identified for the lordosis ARA C2–C7 and the CVA: Spearman’s r = 0.524; R= 0.275;p&lt; 0.001. A value of 50° for the CVA corresponded to a value of 20 mm for the C2–C7 SVA on an X-ray.Conclusion:While the CVA and radiographic C2–C7 SVA are weakly correlated in an individual, they seem to represent different aspects of sagittal cervical balance. The CVA cannot replace radiographically measured cervical lordosis. We recommend that more emphasis be given to radiographic measures of sagittal cervical alignment than the CVA when considering patient interventions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: Neck and jaw pain is common and is associated with jaw functional limitations, postural stability, muscular endurance, and proprioception. This study aimed to investigate the effect of jaw and neck pain on craniocervico- mandibular functions and postural stability in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs).\\nMethods: Fifty-two patients with TMJDs were included and assessed using Fonseca's Questionnaire and the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index. An isometric strength test was performed for the TMJ depressor and cervical muscles. The TMJ position sense (TMJPS) test and cervical joint position error test (CJPET) were employed for proprioception. Total sway degree was obtained for the assessment of postural stability. Deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE) was assessed using the craniocervical flexion test. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was employed to assess mandibular function, and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured for forward head posture.\\nResults: Jaw and neck pain negatively affected CVA (R2 = 0.130), TMJPS (R2 = 0.286), DNFE (R2 = 0.355), TMJ depressor (R2 = 0.145), cervical flexor (R2 = 0.144), and extensor (R2 = 0.148) muscle strength. Jaw and neck pain also positively affected CJPET for flexion (R2 = 0.116) and extension (R2 = 0.146), as well as total sway degree (R2 = 0.128) and MFIQ (R2 = 0.230).\\nConclusions: Patients with painful TMJDs, could have impaired muscle strength and proprioception of the TMJ and cervical region. The jaw and neck pain could also affect postural stability, and the endurance of deep neck flexors as well as mandibular functions in TMJDs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Stroke is a significant health problem that may result in long-term functional deficits. Balance and walking problems are among the most common post-stroke deficits, and they may negatively affect quality of life. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of cervical mobilization on balance and gait parameters after stroke. Participants were 24 adults (aged 30–65 years), who scored 24 or above on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and no more than 3 on the Modified Rankin scale. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental Bobath therapy and cervical mobilization group (n = 12) or a control group who received Bobath therapy and a sham application (n = 12). Both groups received 60 minutes of Bobath therapy three times a week for four weeks; additionally, the experimental group received 15 minutes of cervical mobilization in each session, while the control group received 15 minutes of spinal sham mobilization each session. Pre and post treatment, we assessed all participants’ demographic characteristics, gait parameters, balance parameters, and forward head posture values using a clinical data assessment form, spatiotemporal gait analysis (LEGSystm), portable computerized kinesthetic balance device (SportKAT 550), and craniovertebral angle (CVA), respectively. The groups showed no significant differences in their initial demographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, stroke duration and disability levels.). In comparing changes on variables of interest, we observed significant experimental versus control group improvements in balance parameters except for their left side balance score (right side, left side, forward, backward and total balance scores were significant at p = .003, p = .089, p &lt; .001, p = .022, p &lt; .001, respectively), gait parameters (stride number, stride length, stride time, stride velocity, cadance at p = .007, p = .019, p = .013, p = .005, p = .001, respectively) and CVA (p &lt; .001). Also, there were findings in favor of the experimental group on the modified timed up and go test on walk out, mid turn, walk back and total times (p = .028, p = .001, p = .016, and p = .001, respectively),but not for sit-to-stand time or stand-to-sit time.

       "      <td>BACKGROUND\\n\\nThe cervical vertebrae and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may be linked through their common muscles.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nThe aim of the present study was to compare the linear intra-articular motions of the TMJ between individuals with the normal craniocervical posture (CCP) and severe forward head posture (FHP).\\n\\nDESIGN\\n\\nCross-sectional study.\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nVolunteers (N = 38) were equally assigned to either the severe FHP group or the normal CCP group according to their craniovertebral angle (CVA). The CVA angles greater than 49° were considered as the normal CCP while angles between 44 and 40° were regarded as the severe FHP. The TMJ was imaged at the closed, median, and maximum open positions of the mouth using an ultrasound machine with a 7.5 MHz linear transducer in the sitting position. The best-fitting curve in the contour registration method was employed to measure displacement of the mandibular condyle on the transverse and vertical axes.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe forward displacement of the mandibular condyle in the severe FHP group was significantly (p-value = 0.037) reduced compared to the normal CCP group at maximum open position of the mouth, while no significant difference was revealed at closed (p-value = 0.937) or median open (p-value = 0.699) positions. The perpendicular displacement of the mandibular condyle exhibited no significant (p-value&gt;0.107) difference between groups at any mouth position.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nThe current study demonstrated, for the first time, that severe FHP may impact the intra-articular motion of the TMJ.

       "      <td>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to provide clinical basic data to reduce pain and improve function by comparing neck muscle activity and neck alignment using self-stretching and passive stretching exercises for chronic neck pain caused by forward head posture.METHODS: The subjects were divided into 15 subjects assigned to perform self-stretching exercise and 15 subjects assigned to perform passive stretching exercise. The intervention was conducted for a total of 4 weeks. The muscle activity in the neck was measured by surface electromyography (EMG) before intervention, and craniovertebral and cranial rotation angles were measured by X-ray. The 4-week intervention was conducted and the above items re-measured in the same manner and analyzed.RESULTS: Muscle activity within both groups after intervention using self-stretching or passive stretching exercise was significantly different (p &lt; .05)(p &lt; .01). Neck alignment of both groups was significantly different (p &lt; .001)(p &lt; .01). Further, muscle activities of the upper trapezius and splenius capitis muscles showed significant differences (p&lt;.05). Lastly, neck alignment showed statistically significant difference (p &lt; .05).CONCLUSION: Self-stretching exercise activated motor nerves as a posture correction exercise, thereby improving inhibition of muscle activity, muscle contraction delay, and pathological conditions of the muscle. For future research, interventions of self-stretching exercise will be needed for patients with chronic back pain accompanied by forward head posture, and various clinical studies on postural improvement of forward head posture by maintaining a normal muscle tone state are needed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Purpose : The aim of this study was to assess the intra- and inter-rater reliability and validity of measurements of head, neck, and pelvis posture using a mobile application in subjects with forward head posture.Methods : Forty-eight volunteers (22 men, 26 women) participated in this study. Two raters independently examined whole body picture images in a lateral standing posture with arms crossed using a CA-Smart Posture Reminder (CA-SPR), and a rater took and calculated posture images twice to assess reliability. We measured five parameters: craniovertebral angle 1 (CVA1), anterior shoulder translation (AST), pelvic tilt (PT), knee angle (KA), and ankle angle (AA) in the subject’s sagittal plane using CA-SPR. We examined whole spine X-ray images in the same position to assess validity. We measured four variables in the subjects: CVA2, translation distance (AHT), anterior pelvic plane (APP), and sacral slope (SS). The intra- and inter-rater reliability were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Convergent validity was calculated using Pearson’ s correlation coefficient.Results : The intra-rater reliability (ICC=.889 -.989) and inter-rater reliability (ICC=.800 -.980) were excellent for all variables measured using CA-SPR. The variables measured using CA-SPR and X-ray were significantly positively correlated (r=.623, p&lt;.01). However, the correlation of the variables in the pelvis was not statistically significant.Conclusion : This study shows that a mobile application (CA-SPR) is a useful tool for measuring head and neck posture in subjects with forward head posture.

       "      <td>The Purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of open kinetic chain exercise and closed kinetic chain exercise using sling on thickness of neck flexor during chin-in movement in office workers with forward head posture.\\nThirty-two selected subjects randomly performed resting posture, chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain. In the method of exercise, all subjects were measured the thickness of neck flexor, the thickness of superficial neck flexor, and the thickness of deep neck flexor at resting posture, in open kinetic chain, and closed kinetic chain in order. The exercise method is to install a strap on the head and back in the supine position. At the resting posture, the ear canal and the highest part of the foam roller need to be placed on the same line. With open kinetic chain exercise, elastic band that installed in the head was used for chin-in movement, but with closed kinetic chain exercise, non elastic band that installed in the head was used for chin-in movement In case of chin-in movement with open kinetic chain, the head moves toward the floor during chin-in movement and in case of chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain, the body moves toward the ceiling during chin-in movement rather than head. Prior to the exercise, subjects were fully learned the methods of exercise by using pressure biofeedback unit. Each exercise was performed three times in total. During chin-in movement, each exercise measured total neck flexor, sternocleidomastoid muscle which is superficial neck flexor, and longus colli and longus capitis which are deep neck flexor. Repeated Measure ANOVA was used to compare the thickness of neck flexor depending on exercise methods(resting posture, chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain). Paired T-test was used to compare the changes of neck flexor thickness between chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain (SPSS ver. 25.0).\\nAs a result of comparing the total thickness of neck flexor depending on exercise methods, there were statistically significant differences between resting posture and chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain, and also chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain(p&lt;0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences between resting posture and chin-in movement with open kinetic chain. In the case of superficial neck flexor, the thickness of muscle was slightly reduced during chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain rather than resting posture, but there were no statistically significant differences. In the case of deep neck flexor, the thickness of muscle was increased in chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain rather than resting posture, and also in chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain rather than open kinetic chain, and there were statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05). In comparison of the variation in the thickness of neck flexor, superficial neck flexor showed less change in chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain rather than in open kinetic chain, but there were no statistically significant differences. In the case of longus colli and longus capitis which are deep neck flexor, the amount of change was increased in chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain, and there were statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05).\\nDeep neck flexor has the greatest effect on the change of the thickness of total neck flexor, and chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain is thought to be effective to activate deep neck flexor rather than open kinetic chain. It is considered as an intervention method to be referred when the people with forward head posture exercise chin-in movement.</td>\n",

Two primary categories for determining FHP exist: radiographic and postural measurements.Methods:This study investigated the correlation between the craniovertebral angle (CVA), the radiographically measured C2–C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and cervical lordosis (absolute rotation angle: ARA C2–C7) in a sample of participants with chronic myofascial pain (CMP). In 120 participants, we performed both a postural measurement of the CVA and a lateral cervical radiograph, where the C2–C7 SVA and ARA C2–C7 were measured. A linear-regression Rvalue to assess the correlation between the CVA, C2–C7 SVA, and ARA C2–C7 was sought.Results:A statistically significant weak linear fit was identified (Spearman’s r = 0.549; R= 0.30,p< 0.001) between the CVA and C2–C7 SVA, having considerable variation between the two measures. A statistically significant linear fit (very weak) was identified for the lordosis ARA C2–C7 and the CVA: Spearman’s r = 0.524; R= 0.275;p< 0.001. A value of 50° for the CVA corresponded to a value of 20 mm for the C2–C7 SVA on an X-ray.Conclusion:While the CVA and radiographic C2–C7 SVA are weakly correlated in an individual, they seem to represent different aspects of sagittal cervical balance. The CVA cannot replace radiographically measured cervical lordosis. We recommend that more emphasis be given to radiographic measures of sagittal cervical alignment than the CVA when considering patient interventions.   \n",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of jaw and neck pain on craniocervico- mandibular functions and postural stability in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs).\\nMethods: Fifty-two patients with TMJDs were included and assessed using Fonseca's Questionnaire and the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index. An isometric strength test was performed for the TMJ depressor and cervical muscles. The TMJ position sense (TMJPS) test and cervical joint position error test (CJPET) were employed for proprioception. Total sway degree was obtained for the assessment of postural stability. Deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE) was assessed using the craniocervical flexion test. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was employed to assess mandibular function, and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured for forward head posture.\\nResults: Jaw and neck pain negatively affected CVA (R2 = 0.130), TMJPS (R2 = 0.286), DNFE (R2 = 0.355), TMJ depressor (R2 = 0.145), cervical flexor (R2 = 0.144), and extensor (R2 = 0.148) muscle strength. Jaw and neck pain also positively affected CJPET for flexion (R2 = 0.116) and extension (R2 = 0.146), as well as total sway degree (R2 = 0.128) and MFIQ (R2 = 0.230).\\nConclusions: Patients with painful TMJDs, could have impaired muscle strength and proprioception of the TMJ and cervical region. The jaw and neck pain could also affect postural stability, and the endurance of deep neck flexors as well as mandibular functions in TMJDs.   \n",

Balance and walking problems are among the most common post-stroke deficits, and they may negatively affect quality of life. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of cervical mobilization on balance and gait parameters after stroke. Participants were 24 adults (aged 30–65 years), who scored 24 or above on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and no more than 3 on the Modified Rankin scale. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental Bobath therapy and cervical mobilization group (n = 12) or a control group who received Bobath therapy and a sham application (n = 12). Both groups received 60 minutes of Bobath therapy three times a week for four weeks; additionally, the experimental group received 15 minutes of cervical mobilization in each session, while the control group received 15 minutes of spinal sham mobilization each session. Pre and post treatment, we assessed all participants’ demographic characteristics, gait parameters, balance parameters, and forward head posture values using a clinical data assessment form, spatiotemporal gait analysis (LEGSystm), portable computerized kinesthetic balance device (SportKAT 550), and craniovertebral angle (CVA), respectively. The groups showed no significant differences in their initial demographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, stroke duration and disability levels.). In comparing changes on variables of interest, we observed significant experimental versus control group improvements in balance parameters except for their left side balance score (right side, left side, forward, backward and total balance scores were significant at p = .003, p = .089, p < .001, p = .022, p < .001, respectively), gait parameters (stride number, stride length, stride time, stride velocity, cadance at p = .007, p = .019, p = .013, p = .005, p = .001, respectively) and CVA (p < .001). Also, there were findings in favor of the experimental group on the modified timed up and go test on walk out, mid turn, walk back and total times (p = .028, p = .001, p = .016, and p = .001, respectively),but not for sit-to-stand time or stand-to-sit time. Clinicians involved in stroke rehabilitation should assess and treat the cervical region to enhance rehabilitation effectiveness.   \n",

The CVA angles greater than 49° were considered as the normal CCP while angles between 44 and 40° were regarded as the severe FHP. The TMJ was imaged at the closed, median, and maximum open positions of the mouth using an ultrasound machine with a 7.5 MHz linear transducer in the sitting position. The best-fitting curve in the contour registration method was employed to measure displacement of the mandibular condyle on the transverse and vertical axes.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe forward displacement of the mandibular condyle in the severe FHP group was significantly (p-value = 0.037) reduced compared to the normal CCP group at maximum open position of the mouth, while no significant difference was revealed at closed (p-value = 0.937) or median open (p-value = 0.699) positions. The perpendicular displacement of the mandibular condyle exhibited no significant (p-value>0.107) difference between groups at any mouth position.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nThe current study demonstrated, for the first time, that severe FHP may impact the intra-articular motion of the TMJ. This study presumed that individuals with severe FHP may encounter a force imbalance in the anterior-posterior direction.\\n\\n\\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The intervention was conducted for a total of 4 weeks. The muscle activity in the neck was measured by surface electromyography (EMG) before intervention, and craniovertebral and cranial rotation angles were measured by X-ray. The 4-week intervention was conducted and the above items re-measured in the same manner and analyzed.RESULTS: Muscle activity within both groups after intervention using self-stretching or passive stretching exercise was significantly different (p < .05)(p < .01). Neck alignment of both groups was significantly different (p < .001)(p < .01). Further, muscle activities of the upper trapezius and splenius capitis muscles showed significant differences (p<.05). Lastly, neck alignment showed statistically significant difference (p < .05).CONCLUSION: Self-stretching exercise activated motor nerves as a posture correction exercise, thereby improving inhibition of muscle activity, muscle contraction delay, and pathological conditions of the muscle. For future research, interventions of self-stretching exercise will be needed for patients with chronic back pain accompanied by forward head posture, and various clinical studies on postural improvement of forward head posture by maintaining a normal muscle tone state are needed.   \n",

Two raters independently examined whole body picture images in a lateral standing posture with arms crossed using a CA-Smart Posture Reminder (CA-SPR), and a rater took and calculated posture images twice to assess reliability. We measured five parameters: craniovertebral angle 1 (CVA1), anterior shoulder translation (AST), pelvic tilt (PT), knee angle (KA), and ankle angle (AA) in the subject’s sagittal plane using CA-SPR. We examined whole spine X-ray images in the same position to assess validity. We measured four variables in the subjects: CVA2, translation distance (AHT), anterior pelvic plane (APP), and sacral slope (SS). The intra- and inter-rater reliability were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Convergent validity was calculated using Pearson’ s correlation coefficient.Results : The intra-rater reliability (ICC=.889 -.989) and inter-rater reliability (ICC=.800 -.980) were excellent for all variables measured using CA-SPR. The variables measured using CA-SPR and X-ray were significantly positively correlated (r=.623, p<.01). However, the correlation of the variables in the pelvis was not statistically significant.Conclusion : This study shows that a mobile application (CA-SPR) is a useful tool for measuring head and neck posture in subjects with forward head posture. However, further study is needed to measure pelvic variables when using a mobile application.   \n",

Each group was given the corresponding intervention and changes of the visual analogue scale (VAS), ROM, CVA, CRA, DNFS, and DNFE were measured after the intervention.\\nResults: The UCMG and UTMG did not differ significantly in VAS, ROM, CVA, CRA, DNFS, or DNFE before the interventions using the K-E concept, but after the intervention, the UCMG showed a significantly greater improvement in flexion, bothside rotation, and DNFS strength than the UTMG (p < .05).\\nConclusion: UCM, which is a passive intervention using the K-E concept, would be more helpful than UTM in improving flexion, both rotation, and DNFS.   \n",
       "1784  The Purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of open kinetic chain exercise and closed kinetic chain exercise using sling on thickness of neck flexor during chin-in movement in office workers with forward head posture.\\nThirty-two selected subjects randomly performed resting posture, chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain. In the method of exercise, all subjects were measured the thickness of neck flexor, the thickness of superficial neck flexor, and the thickness of deep neck flexor at resting posture, in open kinetic chain, and closed kinetic chain in order. The exercise method is to install a strap on the head and back in the supine position. At the resting posture, the ear canal and the highest part of the foam roller need to be placed on the same line. With open kinetic chain exercise, elastic band that installed in the head was used for chin-in movement, but with closed kinetic chain exercise, non elastic band that installed in the head was used for chin-in movement In case of chin-in movement with open kinetic chain, the head moves toward the floor during chin-in movement and in case of chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain, the body moves toward the ceiling during chin-in movement rather than head. Prior to the exercise, subjects were fully learned the methods of exercise by using pressure biofeedback unit. Each exercise was performed three times in total. During chin-in movement, each exercise measured total neck flexor, sternocleidomastoid muscle which is superficial neck flexor, and longus colli and longus capitis which are deep neck flexor. Repeated Measure ANOVA was used to compare the thickness of neck flexor depending on exercise methods(resting posture, chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain). Paired T-test was used to compare the changes of neck flexor thickness between chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain (SPSS ver. 25.0).\\nAs a result of comparing the total thickness of neck flexor depending on exercise methods, there were statistically significant differences between resting posture and chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain, and also chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain(p<0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences between resting posture and chin-in movement with open kinetic chain. In the case of superficial neck flexor, the thickness of muscle was slightly reduced during chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain rather than resting posture, but there were no statistically significant differences. In the case of deep neck flexor, the thickness of muscle was increased in chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain rather than resting posture, and also in chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain rather than open kinetic chain, and there were statistically significant differences (p<0.05). In comparison of the variation in the thickness of neck flexor, superficial neck flexor showed less change in chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain rather than in open kinetic chain, but there were no statistically significant differences. In the case of longus colli and longus capitis which are deep neck flexor, the amount of change was increased in chin-in movement with open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain, and there were statistically significant differences (p<0.05).\\nDeep neck flexor has the greatest effect on the change of the thickness of total neck flexor, and chin-in movement with closed kinetic chain is thought to be effective to activate deep neck flexor rather than open kinetic chain. It is considered as an intervention method to be referred when the people with forward head posture exercise chin-in movement.   \n",

Balance and walking problems are among the most common post-stroke deficits, and they may negatively affect quality of life. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of cervical mobilization on balance and gait parameters after stroke. Participants were 24 adults (aged 30–65 years), who scored 24 or above on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and no more than 3 on the Modified Rankin scale. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental Bobath therapy and cervical mobilization group (n = 12) or a control group who received Bobath therapy and a sham application (n = 12). Both groups received 60 minutes of Bobath therapy three times a week for four weeks; additionally, the experimental group received 15 minutes of cervical mobilization in each session, while the control group received 15 minutes of spinal sham mobilization each session. Pre and post treatment, we assessed all participants’ demographic characteristics, gait parameters, balance parameters, and forward head posture values using a clinical data assessment form, spatiotemporal gait analysis (LEGSystm), portable computerized kinesthetic balance device (SportKAT 550), and craniovertebral angle (CVA), respectively. The groups showed no significant differences in their initial demographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, stroke duration and disability levels.). In comparing changes on variables of interest, we observed significant experimental versus control group improvements in balance parameters except for their left side balance score (right side, left side, forward, backward and total balance scores were significant at p = .003, p = .089, p &lt; .001, p = .022, p &lt; .001, respectively), gait parameters (stride number, stride length, stride time, stride velocity, cadance at p = .007, p = .019, p = .013, p = .005, p = .001, respectively) and CVA (p &lt; .001). Also, there were findings in favor of the experimental group on the modified timed up and go test on walk out, mid turn, walk back and total times (p = .028, p = .001, p = .016, and p = .001, respectively),but not for sit-to-stand time or stand-to-sit time. Clinicians involved in stroke rehabilitation should assess and treat the cervical region to enhance rehabilitation effectiveness.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND\\n\\nThe cervical vertebrae and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may be linked through their common muscles.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\n\\nThe aim of the present study was to compare the linear intra-articular motions of the TMJ between individuals with the normal craniocervical posture (CCP) and severe forward head posture (FHP).\\n\\nDESIGN\\n\\nCross-sectional study.\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nVolunteers (N = 38) were equally assigned to either the severe FHP group or the normal CCP group according to their craniovertebral angle (CVA). The CVA angles greater than 49° were considered as the normal CCP while angles between 44 and 40° were regarded as the severe FHP. The TMJ was imaged at the closed, median, and maximum open positions of the mouth using an ultrasound machine with a 7.5 MHz linear transducer in the sitting position. The best-fitting curve in the contour registration method was employed to measure displacement of the mandibular condyle on the transverse and vertical axes.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe forward displacement of the mandibular condyle in the severe FHP group was significantly (p-value = 0.037) reduced compared to the normal CCP group at maximum open position of the mouth, while no significant difference was revealed at closed (p-value = 0.937) or median open (p-value = 0.699) positions. The perpendicular displacement of the mandibular condyle exhibited no significant (p-value&gt;0.107) difference between groups at any mouth position.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nThe current study demonstrated, for the first time, that severe FHP may impact the intra-articular motion of the TMJ.

       "      <td>Background:Forward head posture and rounded shoulder posture are common postural variants found in upper crossed syndrome, which can lead to limited neck mobility, respiratory problems, and other issues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks.Methods:The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre–post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a pairedt-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance.Results:After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (allp&lt; 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj&lt; 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj&lt; 0.05/4) for the Rt.

       "      <td>Purpose: Habitual abnormal postures, such as forward head posture, rounded shoulders, and decreased lumbar lordosis, can adversely affect respiratory function by limiting thoracic rib cage expansion and lung capacity. This study aimed to investigate the immediate effects of a single session of Mckenzie exercises on respiratory function and respiratory muscle.\\nMethods: Eighteen young adults (mean age, 24.22 ± 2.415), including 4 men and 14 women, participated in the study.\\nSpirometry tests were conducted before and after the single exercise session, which consisted of two types of Mckenzie exercises performed in 20 repetitions each. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured to evaluate respiratory function, and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were measured to assess respiratory muscle strength. Paired-sample t-tests were employed to analyze the significance of respiratory measurements pre- and post-Mckenzie exercises, with a significance level set at 0.05. Results: A significant increase in MIP was found after Mckenzie exercises (p=.012), indicating improved inspiratory muscle strength. However, no significant changes were observed in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF, and MEP. Conclusion: Mckenzie exercises, designed to stretch respiratory muscles and correct thoracic rib cage alignment through spinal extension, demonstrated an immediate positive effect on MIP. Therefore, Mckenzie exercises could be considered a valuable chest expansion exercise in respiratory rehabilitation programs. More studies are warranted to explore the potential long-term effects of Mckenzie exercises on respiratory function and respiratory muscle strength.</td>\n",

The intervention was conducted for a total of 4 weeks. The muscle activity in the neck was measured by surface electromyography (EMG) before intervention, and craniovertebral and cranial rotation angles were measured by X-ray. The 4-week intervention was conducted and the above items re-measured in the same manner and analyzed.RESULTS: Muscle activity within both groups after intervention using self-stretching or passive stretching exercise was significantly different (p &lt; .05)(p &lt; .01).

After the conditional statement operation is performed within the application, the vibration is output when the event processing is completed.\\nThe subjects of this study were selected from 30 subjects who showed forward head posture through Cranio Vertebral Angle(CVA) and Cranial Rotation Angle(CRA). Subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=15) and a control group (n=15). The experimental group was giver the cervical-retraction assistive tool and the control group was given the Stabilizer™. Intervention was performed 5 times a week for 6 weeks. CVA and CRA were measured again to investigate the change on neck alignment.\\nThe results showed that the pre- and post-exercise CVA and CRA were significantly differences in the experimental group and the control group. The Inter Quartile Range(IQR) of the difference between pre- and post-exercise CVA in the experimental group was 7.5 and it was 1.23 for the control group. The IQR of the difference between the pre- and post-exercise CRA of the experimental group was 8.19 and it was 1.28 for the control group. The change of CVA was 23.82% in the experimental group and it was 5.51% in the control group. The change of CRA was 5.19% in the experimental group and it was 2.35% in the control group.\\nIn conclusion, this study showed that the cervical-retraction assistive tool was effective in improving the alignment of the neck alignment of the forward head posture as well as Stabilizer™.</td>\n",

Balance and walking problems are among the most common post-stroke deficits, and they may negatively affect quality of life. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of cervical mobilization on balance and gait parameters after stroke. Participants were 24 adults (aged 30–65 years), who scored 24 or above on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and no more than 3 on the Modified Rankin scale. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental Bobath therapy and cervical mobilization group (n = 12) or a control group who received Bobath therapy and a sham application (n = 12). Both groups received 60 minutes of Bobath therapy three times a week for four weeks; additionally, the experimental group received 15 minutes of cervical mobilization in each session, while the control group received 15 minutes of spinal sham mobilization each session. Pre and post treatment, we assessed all participants’ demographic characteristics, gait parameters, balance parameters, and forward head posture values using a clinical data assessment form, spatiotemporal gait analysis (LEGSystm), portable computerized kinesthetic balance device (SportKAT 550), and craniovertebral angle (CVA), respectively. The groups showed no significant differences in their initial demographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, stroke duration and disability levels.). In comparing changes on variables of interest, we observed significant experimental versus control group improvements in balance parameters except for their left side balance score (right side, left side, forward, backward and total balance scores were significant at p = .003, p = .089, p < .001, p = .022, p < .001, respectively), gait parameters (stride number, stride length, stride time, stride velocity, cadance at p = .007, p = .019, p = .013, p = .005, p = .001, respectively) and CVA (p < .001). Also, there were findings in favor of the experimental group on the modified timed up and go test on walk out, mid turn, walk back and total times (p = .028, p = .001, p = .016, and p = .001, respectively),but not for sit-to-stand time or stand-to-sit time. Clinicians involved in stroke rehabilitation should assess and treat the cervical region to enhance rehabilitation effectiveness.   \n",

The CVA angles greater than 49° were considered as the normal CCP while angles between 44 and 40° were regarded as the severe FHP. The TMJ was imaged at the closed, median, and maximum open positions of the mouth using an ultrasound machine with a 7.5 MHz linear transducer in the sitting position. The best-fitting curve in the contour registration method was employed to measure displacement of the mandibular condyle on the transverse and vertical axes.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe forward displacement of the mandibular condyle in the severe FHP group was significantly (p-value = 0.037) reduced compared to the normal CCP group at maximum open position of the mouth, while no significant difference was revealed at closed (p-value = 0.937) or median open (p-value = 0.699) positions. The perpendicular displacement of the mandibular condyle exhibited no significant (p-value>0.107) difference between groups at any mouth position.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nThe current study demonstrated, for the first time, that severe FHP may impact the intra-articular motion of the TMJ.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks.Methods:The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre–post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a pairedt-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance.Results:After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (allp< 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj< 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj< 0.05/4) for the Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD.Conclusions:These findings suggest that the telerehabilitation training group, which included diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, was more effective in improving Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD in males with UCS.   \n",

This study aimed to investigate the immediate effects of a single session of Mckenzie exercises on respiratory function and respiratory muscle.\\nMethods: Eighteen young adults (mean age, 24.22 ± 2.415), including 4 men and 14 women, participated in the study.\\nSpirometry tests were conducted before and after the single exercise session, which consisted of two types of Mckenzie exercises performed in 20 repetitions each. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured to evaluate respiratory function, and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were measured to assess respiratory muscle strength. Paired-sample t-tests were employed to analyze the significance of respiratory measurements pre- and post-Mckenzie exercises, with a significance level set at 0.05. Results: A significant increase in MIP was found after Mckenzie exercises (p=.012), indicating improved inspiratory muscle strength. However, no significant changes were observed in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF, and MEP. Conclusion: Mckenzie exercises, designed to stretch respiratory muscles and correct thoracic rib cage alignment through spinal extension, demonstrated an immediate positive effect on MIP. Therefore, Mckenzie exercises could be considered a valuable chest expansion exercise in respiratory rehabilitation programs. More studies are warranted to explore the potential long-term effects of Mckenzie exercises on respiratory function and respiratory muscle strength.   \n",

METHODS: The subjects were 20 adults in their 20s with a forward head posture: 10 from the Mat Pilates group (MPG) and 10 from the Kinesio taping group (KTG). Each group received the intervention for four weeks. The craniovertebral angle and muscle activity were measured before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis of this study was performed using SPSS Ver. 23.0 for Windows was used, and the statistical significance level was set to α = .05. RESULTS: The change in the craniovertebral angle within each group was decreased significantly after the intervention for both MPG and KTG (p < .05), but there was no significant difference in the comparison result of the difference in the amount of change between each group (p > .05). The change in muscle activity within each group did not show any significant change before and after the intervention in all the MPG and KTG muscles (p > .05), and there was no significant difference in all variables for the difference in the amount of change between each group (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Mat Pilates effectively reduced the CVA, but neither intervention significantly affected muscle activity.   \n",

Thus, this study investigated the effects of FHP on neck and ankle joint position sense, and conducted a comparison between the joint position sense of the right and left ankle.\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nFifty-seven subjects were assigned according to the craniovertebral angle (CVA) into the FHP group (CVA <49°; n = 27) or the control group (CVA >49°; n = 30). Head and ankle joint repositioning accuracy was measured by using a cervical range-of-motion device and an isokinetic dynamometer, respectively.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThere was a significant increase in the joint position error (JPE) of the cervical flexion, extension, and right and left side bending motions of the FHP group compared to the control group (P < .05). There were significant increases in the JPE of the right and left ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the FHP group compared to the healthy group (P < .05). Moreover, the JPE of the right ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the FHP group were significantly higher than the left ankle (P < .05).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nThe FHP decreases the position sense of cervical flexion, extension, and right and left side bending motions, and the plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of both ankle joints, especially the right ankle joint.\\n\\nFrom MEDLINE®/PubMed®, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine   \n",

The intervention was conducted for a total of 4 weeks. The muscle activity in the neck was measured by surface electromyography (EMG) before intervention, and craniovertebral and cranial rotation angles were measured by X-ray. The 4-week intervention was conducted and the above items re-measured in the same manner and analyzed.RESULTS: Muscle activity within both groups after intervention using self-stretching or passive stretching exercise was significantly different (p < .05)(p < .01). Neck alignment of both groups was significantly different (p < .001)(p < .01). Further, muscle activities of the upper trapezius and splenius capitis muscles showed significant differences (p<.05). Lastly, neck alignment showed statistically significant difference (p < .05).CONCLUSION: Self-stretching exercise activated motor nerves as a posture correction exercise, thereby improving inhibition of muscle activity, muscle contraction delay, and pathological conditions of the muscle. For future research, interventions of self-stretching exercise will be needed for patients with chronic back pain accompanied by forward head posture, and various clinical studies on postural improvement of forward head posture by maintaining a normal muscle tone state are needed.   \n",
