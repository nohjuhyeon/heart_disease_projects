       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nForward head posture (FHP) is a serious problem causing head and neck disability, but the characteristics of muscle activity during long-term postural maintenance are unclear. This study aimed to investigate a comparison of electromyography (EMG) activation properties and subjective fatigue between young adults with and without habitual FHP. In this study, we examined the changes in the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of muscle activity using high-density surface EMG (HD-SEMG) in addition to mean frequency, a conventional measure of muscle fatigue. Nineteen male participants were included in the study (FHP group (n = 9; age = 22.3 ± 1.5 years) and normal group (n = 10; age = 22.5 ± 1.4 years)). Participants held three head positions (e.g., forward, backward, and neutral positions) for a total of 30 min each, and the EMG activity of the trapezius pars descendens muscle during posture maintenance was measured by HD-SEMG. The root mean square (RMS), the modified entropy, and the correlation coefficient were calculated. Additionally, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was evaluated to assess subjective fatigue. The RMS, VAS, modified entropy, and correlation coefficients were significantly higher in the FHP group than in the normal group (p &lt; 0.001). With increasing postural maintenance time, the modified entropy and correlation coefficient values significantly decreased, and the mean frequency and VAS values significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the forward position had significantly higher RMS, correlation coefficient, modified entropy, and VAS values than in the neutral position (p &lt; 0.001). The HD-SEMG potential distribution patterns in the FHP group showed less heterogeneity and greater muscle activity in the entire muscle and subjective fatigue than those in the normal group. Excess muscle activity even in the neutral/comfortable position in the FHP group could potentially be a mechanism of neuromuscular conditions in this population.\\nSubject terms: Health care, Engineering</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nThe hand explores the environment for obtaining tactile information that can be fruitfully integrated with other functions, such as vision, audition, and movement. In theory, somatosensory signals gathered by the hand are accurately mapped in the world-centered (allocentric) reference frame such that the multi-modal information signals, whether visual-tactile or motor-tactile, are perfectly aligned. However, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that the perceived tactile orientation or direction is inaccurate; yielding a surprisingly large perceptual bias. To investigate such perceptual bias, this study presented tactile motion stimuli to healthy adult participants in a variety of finger and head postures, and requested the participants to report the perceived direction of motion mapped on a video screen placed on the frontoparallel plane in front of the eyes. Experimental results showed that the perceptual bias could be divided into systematic and nonsystematic biases. Systematic bias, defined as the mean difference between the perceived and veridical directions, correlated linearly with the relative posture between the finger and the head. By contrast, nonsystematic bias, defined as minor difference in bias for different stimulus directions, was highly individualized, phase-locked to stimulus orientation presented on the skin. Overall, the present findings on systematic bias indicate that the transformation bias among the reference frames is dominated by the finger-to-head posture. Moreover, the highly individualized nature of nonsystematic bias reflects how information is obtained by the orientation-selective units in the S1 cortex.\\nSubject terms: Somatosensory system, Human behaviour</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nABSTRACT\\nInstantaneous head posture (IHP) can extensively alter resting hyoid position in humans, yet postural effects on resting hyoid position remain poorly documented among mammals in general. Clarifying this relationship is essential for evaluating interspecific variation in hyoid posture across evolution, and understanding its implications for hyolingual soft tissue function and swallowing motor control. Using Didelphis virginiana as a model, we conducted static manipulation experiments to show that head flexion shifts hyoid position rostrally relative to the cranium across different gapes. IHP-induced shifts in hyoid position along the anteroposterior axis are comparable to in vivo hyoid protraction distance during swallowing. IHP also has opposite effects on passive genio- and stylohyoid muscle lengths. High-speed biplanar videoradiography suggests Didelphis consistently swallows at neutral to flexed posture, with stereotyped hyoid kinematics across different head postures. IHP change can affect suprahyoid muscle force production by shifting their positions on the length-tension curve, and redirecting lines of action and the resultant force from supra- and infrahyoid muscles. We hypothesize that demands on muscle performance may constrain the range of swallowing head postures in mammals.\\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals’.\\nKeywords: biomechanics, muscle physiology, mammal evolution, swallowing, Didelphis virginiana</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nForward head posture (FHP) is one of the most common postural deviations. Deep neck muscle imbalance of individuals with FHP is of primary concern in clinical rehabilitation. However, there is scarce quantitative research on changes in deep neck muscle length with the head moving forward. This study aimed to investigate changes in deep neck muscle length with different severity levels of FHP. Six Thiel‐embalmed cadavers (four males and two females) were dissected, and 16 deep neck muscles in each cadaver were modeled by a MicroScribe 3D Digitizer in the neutral head posture, slight FHP, and severe FHP. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate the degrees of FHP. Quantitative length change of the deep neck muscles was analyzed using Rhinoceros 3D. In slight FHP significant changes in length occurred in four muscles: two shortened (upper semispinalis capitis, rectus capitis posterior minor) and two lengthened (longus capitis, splenius cervicis). In severe FHP all occipital extensors were significantly shortened (10.6 ± 6.4%), except for obliquus capitis superior, and all cervical extensors were significantly lengthened (4.8 ± 3.4%), while longus capitis (occipital flexor) and the superior oblique part of the longus colli (cervical flexor) were lengthened by 8.8 ± 3.8% and 4.2 ± 3.1%, respectively. No significant length change was observed for the axial rotator. This study presents an alternate anatomical insight into the clinical rehabilitation of FHP. Six muscles appear to be important in restoring optimal head posture, with improvements in FHP being related to interventions associated with the occipital and cervical extensors.\\nKeywords: cervical spine, deep neck muscles, forward head posture, muscle length change</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable, non-invasive, brain imaging technology that uses low levels of non-ionizing light to record changes in cerebral blood flow in the brain through optical sensors placed on the surface of the scalp. These signals are recorded via flexible fiber optic cables, which allow neuroimaging experiments to be conducted on participants while performing tasks such as standing or walking. FNIRS has the potential to provide new insights into the evolution of brain activation during ambulatory motor learning tasks and standing tasks to probe balance and vestibular function. In this study, a 32 channel fNIRS system was used to record blood flow changes in the frontal, motor, sensory, and temporal cortices during active balancing associated with playing a video game simulating downhill skiing (Nintendo Wii™; Wii-fit™). Using fNIRS, we found activation of superior temporal gyrus, which was modulated by the difficulty of the balance task. This region had been previously implicated in vestibular function from other animal and human studies.\\nKeywords: Brain imaging, Brain Function, Neuroimaging, Balance, Near-infrared spectroscopy, Vestibular cortex</td>\n",

This study aimed to investigate a comparison of electromyography (EMG) activation properties and subjective fatigue between young adults with and without habitual FHP. In this study, we examined the changes in the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of muscle activity using high-density surface EMG (HD-SEMG) in addition to mean frequency, a conventional measure of muscle fatigue. Nineteen male participants were included in the study (FHP group (n = 9; age = 22.3 ± 1.5 years) and normal group (n = 10; age = 22.5 ± 1.4 years)). Participants held three head positions (e.g., forward, backward, and neutral positions) for a total of 30 min each, and the EMG activity of the trapezius pars descendens muscle during posture maintenance was measured by HD-SEMG. The root mean square (RMS), the modified entropy, and the correlation coefficient were calculated. Additionally, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was evaluated to assess subjective fatigue. The RMS, VAS, modified entropy, and correlation coefficients were significantly higher in the FHP group than in the normal group (p < 0.001). With increasing postural maintenance time, the modified entropy and correlation coefficient values significantly decreased, and the mean frequency and VAS values significantly increased (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the forward position had significantly higher RMS, correlation coefficient, modified entropy, and VAS values than in the neutral position (p < 0.001). The HD-SEMG potential distribution patterns in the FHP group showed less heterogeneity and greater muscle activity in the entire muscle and subjective fatigue than those in the normal group. Excess muscle activity even in the neutral/comfortable position in the FHP group could potentially be a mechanism of neuromuscular conditions in this population.\\nSubject terms: Health care, Engineering   \n",

In theory, somatosensory signals gathered by the hand are accurately mapped in the world-centered (allocentric) reference frame such that the multi-modal information signals, whether visual-tactile or motor-tactile, are perfectly aligned. However, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that the perceived tactile orientation or direction is inaccurate; yielding a surprisingly large perceptual bias. To investigate such perceptual bias, this study presented tactile motion stimuli to healthy adult participants in a variety of finger and head postures, and requested the participants to report the perceived direction of motion mapped on a video screen placed on the frontoparallel plane in front of the eyes. Experimental results showed that the perceptual bias could be divided into systematic and nonsystematic biases. Systematic bias, defined as the mean difference between the perceived and veridical directions, correlated linearly with the relative posture between the finger and the head. By contrast, nonsystematic bias, defined as minor difference in bias for different stimulus directions, was highly individualized, phase-locked to stimulus orientation presented on the skin. Overall, the present findings on systematic bias indicate that the transformation bias among the reference frames is dominated by the finger-to-head posture. Moreover, the highly individualized nature of nonsystematic bias reflects how information is obtained by the orientation-selective units in the S1 cortex.\\nSubject terms: Somatosensory system, Human behaviour   \n",

Clarifying this relationship is essential for evaluating interspecific variation in hyoid posture across evolution, and understanding its implications for hyolingual soft tissue function and swallowing motor control. Using Didelphis virginiana as a model, we conducted static manipulation experiments to show that head flexion shifts hyoid position rostrally relative to the cranium across different gapes. IHP-induced shifts in hyoid position along the anteroposterior axis are comparable to in vivo hyoid protraction distance during swallowing. IHP also has opposite effects on passive genio- and stylohyoid muscle lengths. High-speed biplanar videoradiography suggests Didelphis consistently swallows at neutral to flexed posture, with stereotyped hyoid kinematics across different head postures. IHP change can affect suprahyoid muscle force production by shifting their positions on the length-tension curve, and redirecting lines of action and the resultant force from supra- and infrahyoid muscles. We hypothesize that demands on muscle performance may constrain the range of swallowing head postures in mammals.\\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals’.\\nKeywords: biomechanics, muscle physiology, mammal evolution, swallowing, Didelphis virginiana   \n",

Deep neck muscle imbalance of individuals with FHP is of primary concern in clinical rehabilitation. However, there is scarce quantitative research on changes in deep neck muscle length with the head moving forward. This study aimed to investigate changes in deep neck muscle length with different severity levels of FHP. Six Thiel‐embalmed cadavers (four males and two females) were dissected, and 16 deep neck muscles in each cadaver were modeled by a MicroScribe 3D Digitizer in the neutral head posture, slight FHP, and severe FHP. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate the degrees of FHP. Quantitative length change of the deep neck muscles was analyzed using Rhinoceros 3D. In slight FHP significant changes in length occurred in four muscles: two shortened (upper semispinalis capitis, rectus capitis posterior minor) and two lengthened (longus capitis, splenius cervicis). In severe FHP all occipital extensors were significantly shortened (10.6 ± 6.4%), except for obliquus capitis superior, and all cervical extensors were significantly lengthened (4.8 ± 3.4%), while longus capitis (occipital flexor) and the superior oblique part of the longus colli (cervical flexor) were lengthened by 8.8 ± 3.8% and 4.2 ± 3.1%, respectively. No significant length change was observed for the axial rotator. This study presents an alternate anatomical insight into the clinical rehabilitation of FHP.

These signals are recorded via flexible fiber optic cables, which allow neuroimaging experiments to be conducted on participants while performing tasks such as standing or walking. FNIRS has the potential to provide new insights into the evolution of brain activation during ambulatory motor learning tasks and standing tasks to probe balance and vestibular function. In this study, a 32 channel fNIRS system was used to record blood flow changes in the frontal, motor, sensory, and temporal cortices during active balancing associated with playing a video game simulating downhill skiing (Nintendo Wii™; Wii-fit™). Using fNIRS, we found activation of superior temporal gyrus, which was modulated by the difficulty of the balance task. This region had been previously implicated in vestibular function from other animal and human studies.\\nKeywords: Brain imaging, Brain Function, Neuroimaging, Balance, Near-infrared spectroscopy, Vestibular cortex   \n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nForward head posture (FHP) is a serious problem causing head and neck disability, but the characteristics of muscle activity during long-term postural maintenance are unclear. This study aimed to investigate a comparison of electromyography (EMG) activation properties and subjective fatigue between young adults with and without habitual FHP. In this study, we examined the changes in the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of muscle activity using high-density surface EMG (HD-SEMG) in addition to mean frequency, a conventional measure of muscle fatigue. Nineteen male participants were included in the study (FHP group (n = 9; age = 22.3 ± 1.5 years) and normal group (n = 10; age = 22.5 ± 1.4 years)). Participants held three head positions (e.g., forward, backward, and neutral positions) for a total of 30 min each, and the EMG activity of the trapezius pars descendens muscle during posture maintenance was measured by HD-SEMG. The root mean square (RMS), the modified entropy, and the correlation coefficient were calculated. Additionally, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was evaluated to assess subjective fatigue. The RMS, VAS, modified entropy, and correlation coefficients were significantly higher in the FHP group than in the normal group (p &lt; 0.001). With increasing postural maintenance time, the modified entropy and correlation coefficient values significantly decreased, and the mean frequency and VAS values significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the forward position had significantly higher RMS, correlation coefficient, modified entropy, and VAS values than in the neutral position (p &lt; 0.001). The HD-SEMG potential distribution patterns in the FHP group showed less heterogeneity and greater muscle activity in the entire muscle and subjective fatigue than those in the normal group. Excess muscle activity even in the neutral/comfortable position in the FHP group could potentially be a mechanism of neuromuscular conditions in this population.\\nSubject terms: Health care, Engineering</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nThe hand explores the environment for obtaining tactile information that can be fruitfully integrated with other functions, such as vision, audition, and movement. In theory, somatosensory signals gathered by the hand are accurately mapped in the world-centered (allocentric) reference frame such that the multi-modal information signals, whether visual-tactile or motor-tactile, are perfectly aligned. However, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that the perceived tactile orientation or direction is inaccurate; yielding a surprisingly large perceptual bias. To investigate such perceptual bias, this study presented tactile motion stimuli to healthy adult participants in a variety of finger and head postures, and requested the participants to report the perceived direction of motion mapped on a video screen placed on the frontoparallel plane in front of the eyes. Experimental results showed that the perceptual bias could be divided into systematic and nonsystematic biases. Systematic bias, defined as the mean difference between the perceived and veridical directions, correlated linearly with the relative posture between the finger and the head. By contrast, nonsystematic bias, defined as minor difference in bias for different stimulus directions, was highly individualized, phase-locked to stimulus orientation presented on the skin. Overall, the present findings on systematic bias indicate that the transformation bias among the reference frames is dominated by the finger-to-head posture. Moreover, the highly individualized nature of nonsystematic bias reflects how information is obtained by the orientation-selective units in the S1 cortex.\\nSubject terms: Somatosensory system, Human behaviour</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nABSTRACT\\nInstantaneous head posture (IHP) can extensively alter resting hyoid position in humans, yet postural effects on resting hyoid position remain poorly documented among mammals in general. Clarifying this relationship is essential for evaluating interspecific variation in hyoid posture across evolution, and understanding its implications for hyolingual soft tissue function and swallowing motor control. Using Didelphis virginiana as a model, we conducted static manipulation experiments to show that head flexion shifts hyoid position rostrally relative to the cranium across different gapes. IHP-induced shifts in hyoid position along the anteroposterior axis are comparable to in vivo hyoid protraction distance during swallowing. IHP also has opposite effects on passive genio- and stylohyoid muscle lengths. High-speed biplanar videoradiography suggests Didelphis consistently swallows at neutral to flexed posture, with stereotyped hyoid kinematics across different head postures. IHP change can affect suprahyoid muscle force production by shifting their positions on the length-tension curve, and redirecting lines of action and the resultant force from supra- and infrahyoid muscles. We hypothesize that demands on muscle performance may constrain the range of swallowing head postures in mammals.\\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals’.\\nKeywords: biomechanics, muscle physiology, mammal evolution, swallowing, Didelphis virginiana</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nForward head posture (FHP) is one of the most common postural deviations. Deep neck muscle imbalance of individuals with FHP is of primary concern in clinical rehabilitation. However, there is scarce quantitative research on changes in deep neck muscle length with the head moving forward. This study aimed to investigate changes in deep neck muscle length with different severity levels of FHP. Six Thiel‐embalmed cadavers (four males and two females) were dissected, and 16 deep neck muscles in each cadaver were modeled by a MicroScribe 3D Digitizer in the neutral head posture, slight FHP, and severe FHP. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate the degrees of FHP. Quantitative length change of the deep neck muscles was analyzed using Rhinoceros 3D. In slight FHP significant changes in length occurred in four muscles: two shortened (upper semispinalis capitis, rectus capitis posterior minor) and two lengthened (longus capitis, splenius cervicis). In severe FHP all occipital extensors were significantly shortened (10.6 ± 6.4%), except for obliquus capitis superior, and all cervical extensors were significantly lengthened (4.8 ± 3.4%), while longus capitis (occipital flexor) and the superior oblique part of the longus colli (cervical flexor) were lengthened by 8.8 ± 3.8% and 4.2 ± 3.1%, respectively. No significant length change was observed for the axial rotator. This study presents an alternate anatomical insight into the clinical rehabilitation of FHP. Six muscles appear to be important in restoring optimal head posture, with improvements in FHP being related to interventions associated with the occipital and cervical extensors.\\nKeywords: cervical spine, deep neck muscles, forward head posture, muscle length change</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable, non-invasive, brain imaging technology that uses low levels of non-ionizing light to record changes in cerebral blood flow in the brain through optical sensors placed on the surface of the scalp. These signals are recorded via flexible fiber optic cables, which allow neuroimaging experiments to be conducted on participants while performing tasks such as standing or walking. FNIRS has the potential to provide new insights into the evolution of brain activation during ambulatory motor learning tasks and standing tasks to probe balance and vestibular function. In this study, a 32 channel fNIRS system was used to record blood flow changes in the frontal, motor, sensory, and temporal cortices during active balancing associated with playing a video game simulating downhill skiing (Nintendo Wii™; Wii-fit™). Using fNIRS, we found activation of superior temporal gyrus, which was modulated by the difficulty of the balance task. This region had been previously implicated in vestibular function from other animal and human studies.\\nKeywords: Brain imaging, Brain Function, Neuroimaging, Balance, Near-infrared spectroscopy, Vestibular cortex</td>\n",

This study aimed to investigate a comparison of electromyography (EMG) activation properties and subjective fatigue between young adults with and without habitual FHP. In this study, we examined the changes in the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of muscle activity using high-density surface EMG (HD-SEMG) in addition to mean frequency, a conventional measure of muscle fatigue. Nineteen male participants were included in the study (FHP group (n = 9; age = 22.3 ± 1.5 years) and normal group (n = 10; age = 22.5 ± 1.4 years)). Participants held three head positions (e.g., forward, backward, and neutral positions) for a total of 30 min each, and the EMG activity of the trapezius pars descendens muscle during posture maintenance was measured by HD-SEMG. The root mean square (RMS), the modified entropy, and the correlation coefficient were calculated. Additionally, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was evaluated to assess subjective fatigue. The RMS, VAS, modified entropy, and correlation coefficients were significantly higher in the FHP group than in the normal group (p < 0.001). With increasing postural maintenance time, the modified entropy and correlation coefficient values significantly decreased, and the mean frequency and VAS values significantly increased (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the forward position had significantly higher RMS, correlation coefficient, modified entropy, and VAS values than in the neutral position (p < 0.001). The HD-SEMG potential distribution patterns in the FHP group showed less heterogeneity and greater muscle activity in the entire muscle and subjective fatigue than those in the normal group. Excess muscle activity even in the neutral/comfortable position in the FHP group could potentially be a mechanism of neuromuscular conditions in this population.\\nSubject terms: Health care, Engineering   \n",

In theory, somatosensory signals gathered by the hand are accurately mapped in the world-centered (allocentric) reference frame such that the multi-modal information signals, whether visual-tactile or motor-tactile, are perfectly aligned. However, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that the perceived tactile orientation or direction is inaccurate; yielding a surprisingly large perceptual bias. To investigate such perceptual bias, this study presented tactile motion stimuli to healthy adult participants in a variety of finger and head postures, and requested the participants to report the perceived direction of motion mapped on a video screen placed on the frontoparallel plane in front of the eyes. Experimental results showed that the perceptual bias could be divided into systematic and nonsystematic biases. Systematic bias, defined as the mean difference between the perceived and veridical directions, correlated linearly with the relative posture between the finger and the head. By contrast, nonsystematic bias, defined as minor difference in bias for different stimulus directions, was highly individualized, phase-locked to stimulus orientation presented on the skin. Overall, the present findings on systematic bias indicate that the transformation bias among the reference frames is dominated by the finger-to-head posture. Moreover, the highly individualized nature of nonsystematic bias reflects how information is obtained by the orientation-selective units in the S1 cortex.\\nSubject terms: Somatosensory system, Human behaviour   \n",

Clarifying this relationship is essential for evaluating interspecific variation in hyoid posture across evolution, and understanding its implications for hyolingual soft tissue function and swallowing motor control. Using Didelphis virginiana as a model, we conducted static manipulation experiments to show that head flexion shifts hyoid position rostrally relative to the cranium across different gapes. IHP-induced shifts in hyoid position along the anteroposterior axis are comparable to in vivo hyoid protraction distance during swallowing. IHP also has opposite effects on passive genio- and stylohyoid muscle lengths. High-speed biplanar videoradiography suggests Didelphis consistently swallows at neutral to flexed posture, with stereotyped hyoid kinematics across different head postures. IHP change can affect suprahyoid muscle force production by shifting their positions on the length-tension curve, and redirecting lines of action and the resultant force from supra- and infrahyoid muscles. We hypothesize that demands on muscle performance may constrain the range of swallowing head postures in mammals.\\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals’.\\nKeywords: biomechanics, muscle physiology, mammal evolution, swallowing, Didelphis virginiana   \n",

Deep neck muscle imbalance of individuals with FHP is of primary concern in clinical rehabilitation. However, there is scarce quantitative research on changes in deep neck muscle length with the head moving forward. This study aimed to investigate changes in deep neck muscle length with different severity levels of FHP. Six Thiel‐embalmed cadavers (four males and two females) were dissected, and 16 deep neck muscles in each cadaver were modeled by a MicroScribe 3D Digitizer in the neutral head posture, slight FHP, and severe FHP. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate the degrees of FHP. Quantitative length change of the deep neck muscles was analyzed using Rhinoceros 3D. In slight FHP significant changes in length occurred in four muscles: two shortened (upper semispinalis capitis, rectus capitis posterior minor) and two lengthened (longus capitis, splenius cervicis). In severe FHP all occipital extensors were significantly shortened (10.6 ± 6.4%), except for obliquus capitis superior, and all cervical extensors were significantly lengthened (4.8 ± 3.4%), while longus capitis (occipital flexor) and the superior oblique part of the longus colli (cervical flexor) were lengthened by 8.8 ± 3.8% and 4.2 ± 3.1%, respectively. No significant length change was observed for the axial rotator. This study presents an alternate anatomical insight into the clinical rehabilitation of FHP.

These signals are recorded via flexible fiber optic cables, which allow neuroimaging experiments to be conducted on participants while performing tasks such as standing or walking. FNIRS has the potential to provide new insights into the evolution of brain activation during ambulatory motor learning tasks and standing tasks to probe balance and vestibular function. In this study, a 32 channel fNIRS system was used to record blood flow changes in the frontal, motor, sensory, and temporal cortices during active balancing associated with playing a video game simulating downhill skiing (Nintendo Wii™; Wii-fit™). Using fNIRS, we found activation of superior temporal gyrus, which was modulated by the difficulty of the balance task. This region had been previously implicated in vestibular function from other animal and human studies.\\nKeywords: Brain imaging, Brain Function, Neuroimaging, Balance, Near-infrared spectroscopy, Vestibular cortex   \n",

       "'go to: abstract instantaneous head posture (ihp) can extensively alter resting hyoid position in humans, yet postural effects on resting hyoid position remain poorly documented among mammals in general. clarifying this relationship is essential for evaluating interspecific variation in hyoid posture across evolution, and understanding its implications for hyolingual soft tissue function and swallowing motor control. using didelphis virginiana as a model, we conducted static manipulation experiments to show that head flexion shifts hyoid position rostrally relative to the cranium across different gapes. ihp-induced shifts in hyoid position along the anteroposterior axis are comparable to in vivo hyoid protraction distance during swallowing. ihp also has opposite effects on passive genio- and stylohyoid muscle lengths. high-speed biplanar videoradiography suggests didelphis consistently swallows at neutral to flexed posture, with stereotyped hyoid kinematics across different head postures. ihp change can affect suprahyoid muscle force production by shifting their positions on the length-tension curve, and redirecting lines of action and the resultant force from supra- and infrahyoid muscles. we hypothesize that demands on muscle performance may constrain the range of swallowing head postures in mammals. this article is part of the theme issue ‘food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals’. keywords: biomechanics, muscle physiology, mammal evolution, swallowing, didelphis virginiana'"

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nForward head posture (FHP) is a serious problem causing head and neck disability, but the characteristics of muscle activity during long-term postural maintenance are unclear. This study aimed to investigate a comparison of electromyography (EMG) activation properties and subjective fatigue between young adults with and without habitual FHP. In this study, we examined the changes in the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of muscle activity using high-density surface EMG (HD-SEMG) in addition to mean frequency, a conventional measure of muscle fatigue. Nineteen male participants were included in the study (FHP group (n = 9; age = 22.3 ± 1.5 years) and normal group (n = 10; age = 22.5 ± 1.4 years)). Participants held three head positions (e.g., forward, backward, and neutral positions) for a total of 30 min each, and the EMG activity of the trapezius pars descendens muscle during posture maintenance was measured by HD-SEMG. The root mean square (RMS), the modified entropy, and the correlation coefficient were calculated. Additionally, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was evaluated to assess subjective fatigue. The RMS, VAS, modified entropy, and correlation coefficients were significantly higher in the FHP group than in the normal group (p &lt; 0.001). With increasing postural maintenance time, the modified entropy and correlation coefficient values significantly decreased, and the mean frequency and VAS values significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the forward position had significantly higher RMS, correlation coefficient, modified entropy, and VAS values than in the neutral position (p &lt; 0.001). The HD-SEMG potential distribution patterns in the FHP group showed less heterogeneity and greater muscle activity in the entire muscle and subjective fatigue than those in the normal group. Excess muscle activity even in the neutral/comfortable position in the FHP group could potentially be a mechanism of neuromuscular conditions in this population.\\nSubject terms: Health care, Engineering</td>\n",

In theory, somatosensory signals gathered by the hand are accurately mapped in the world-centered (allocentric) reference frame such that the multi-modal information signals, whether visual-tactile or motor-tactile, are perfectly aligned. However, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that the perceived tactile orientation or direction is inaccurate; yielding a surprisingly large perceptual bias. To investigate such perceptual bias, this study presented tactile motion stimuli to healthy adult participants in a variety of finger and head postures, and requested the participants to report the perceived direction of motion mapped on a video screen placed on the frontoparallel plane in front of the eyes. Experimental results showed that the perceptual bias could be divided into systematic and nonsystematic biases. Systematic bias, defined as the mean difference between the perceived and veridical directions, correlated linearly with the relative posture between the finger and the head. By contrast, nonsystematic bias, defined as minor difference in bias for different stimulus directions, was highly individualized, phase-locked to stimulus orientation presented on the skin. Overall, the present findings on systematic bias indicate that the transformation bias among the reference frames is dominated by the finger-to-head posture. Moreover, the highly individualized nature of nonsystematic bias reflects how information is obtained by the orientation-selective units in the S1 cortex.\\nSubject terms: Somatosensory system, Human behaviour</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nABSTRACT\\nInstantaneous head posture (IHP) can extensively alter resting hyoid position in humans, yet postural effects on resting hyoid position remain poorly documented among mammals in general. Clarifying this relationship is essential for evaluating interspecific variation in hyoid posture across evolution, and understanding its implications for hyolingual soft tissue function and swallowing motor control. Using Didelphis virginiana as a model, we conducted static manipulation experiments to show that head flexion shifts hyoid position rostrally relative to the cranium across different gapes. IHP-induced shifts in hyoid position along the anteroposterior axis are comparable to in vivo hyoid protraction distance during swallowing. IHP also has opposite effects on passive genio- and stylohyoid muscle lengths. High-speed biplanar videoradiography suggests Didelphis consistently swallows at neutral to flexed posture, with stereotyped hyoid kinematics across different head postures. IHP change can affect suprahyoid muscle force production by shifting their positions on the length-tension curve, and redirecting lines of action and the resultant force from supra- and infrahyoid muscles. We hypothesize that demands on muscle performance may constrain the range of swallowing head postures in mammals.\\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals’.\\nKeywords: biomechanics, muscle physiology, mammal evolution, swallowing, Didelphis virginiana</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nForward head posture (FHP) is one of the most common postural deviations. Deep neck muscle imbalance of individuals with FHP is of primary concern in clinical rehabilitation. However, there is scarce quantitative research on changes in deep neck muscle length with the head moving forward. This study aimed to investigate changes in deep neck muscle length with different severity levels of FHP. Six Thiel‐embalmed cadavers (four males and two females) were dissected, and 16 deep neck muscles in each cadaver were modeled by a MicroScribe 3D Digitizer in the neutral head posture, slight FHP, and severe FHP. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate the degrees of FHP. Quantitative length change of the deep neck muscles was analyzed using Rhinoceros 3D. In slight FHP significant changes in length occurred in four muscles: two shortened (upper semispinalis capitis, rectus capitis posterior minor) and two lengthened (longus capitis, splenius cervicis). In severe FHP all occipital extensors were significantly shortened (10.6 ± 6.4%), except for obliquus capitis superior, and all cervical extensors were significantly lengthened (4.8 ± 3.4%), while longus capitis (occipital flexor) and the superior oblique part of the longus colli (cervical flexor) were lengthened by 8.8 ± 3.8% and 4.2 ± 3.1%, respectively. No significant length change was observed for the axial rotator. This study presents an alternate anatomical insight into the clinical rehabilitation of FHP. Six muscles appear to be important in restoring optimal head posture, with improvements in FHP being related to interventions associated with the occipital and cervical extensors.\\nKeywords: cervical spine, deep neck muscles, forward head posture, muscle length change</td>\n",

FNIRS has the potential to provide new insights into the evolution of brain activation during ambulatory motor learning tasks and standing tasks to probe balance and vestibular function. In this study, a 32 channel fNIRS system was used to record blood flow changes in the frontal, motor, sensory, and temporal cortices during active balancing associated with playing a video game simulating downhill skiing (Nintendo Wii™; Wii-fit™). Using fNIRS, we found activation of superior temporal gyrus, which was modulated by the difficulty of the balance task.

This study aimed to investigate a comparison of electromyography (EMG) activation properties and subjective fatigue between young adults with and without habitual FHP. In this study, we examined the changes in the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of muscle activity using high-density surface EMG (HD-SEMG) in addition to mean frequency, a conventional measure of muscle fatigue. Nineteen male participants were included in the study (FHP group (n = 9; age = 22.3 ± 1.5 years) and normal group (n = 10; age = 22.5 ± 1.4 years)). Participants held three head positions (e.g., forward, backward, and neutral positions) for a total of 30 min each, and the EMG activity of the trapezius pars descendens muscle during posture maintenance was measured by HD-SEMG. The root mean square (RMS), the modified entropy, and the correlation coefficient were calculated. Additionally, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was evaluated to assess subjective fatigue. The RMS, VAS, modified entropy, and correlation coefficients were significantly higher in the FHP group than in the normal group (p < 0.001). With increasing postural maintenance time, the modified entropy and correlation coefficient values significantly decreased, and the mean frequency and VAS values significantly increased (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the forward position had significantly higher RMS, correlation coefficient, modified entropy, and VAS values than in the neutral position (p < 0.001). The HD-SEMG potential distribution patterns in the FHP group showed less heterogeneity and greater muscle activity in the entire muscle and subjective fatigue than those in the normal group. Excess muscle activity even in the neutral/comfortable position in the FHP group could potentially be a mechanism of neuromuscular conditions in this population.\\nSubject terms: Health care, Engineering    \n",

In theory, somatosensory signals gathered by the hand are accurately mapped in the world-centered (allocentric) reference frame such that the multi-modal information signals, whether visual-tactile or motor-tactile, are perfectly aligned. However, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that the perceived tactile orientation or direction is inaccurate; yielding a surprisingly large perceptual bias. To investigate such perceptual bias, this study presented tactile motion stimuli to healthy adult participants in a variety of finger and head postures, and requested the participants to report the perceived direction of motion mapped on a video screen placed on the frontoparallel plane in front of the eyes. Experimental results showed that the perceptual bias could be divided into systematic and nonsystematic biases. Systematic bias, defined as the mean difference between the perceived and veridical directions, correlated linearly with the relative posture between the finger and the head. By contrast, nonsystematic bias, defined as minor difference in bias for different stimulus directions, was highly individualized, phase-locked to stimulus orientation presented on the skin. Overall, the present findings on systematic bias indicate that the transformation bias among the reference frames is dominated by the finger-to-head posture. Moreover, the highly individualized nature of nonsystematic bias reflects how information is obtained by the orientation-selective units in the S1 cortex.\\nSubject terms: Somatosensory system, Human behaviour    \n",

Clarifying this relationship is essential for evaluating interspecific variation in hyoid posture across evolution, and understanding its implications for hyolingual soft tissue function and swallowing motor control. Using Didelphis virginiana as a model, we conducted static manipulation experiments to show that head flexion shifts hyoid position rostrally relative to the cranium across different gapes. IHP-induced shifts in hyoid position along the anteroposterior axis are comparable to in vivo hyoid protraction distance during swallowing. IHP also has opposite effects on passive genio- and stylohyoid muscle lengths. High-speed biplanar videoradiography suggests Didelphis consistently swallows at neutral to flexed posture, with stereotyped hyoid kinematics across different head postures. IHP change can affect suprahyoid muscle force production by shifting their positions on the length-tension curve, and redirecting lines of action and the resultant force from supra- and infrahyoid muscles. We hypothesize that demands on muscle performance may constrain the range of swallowing head postures in mammals.\\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals’.\\nKeywords: biomechanics, muscle physiology, mammal evolution, swallowing, Didelphis virginiana    \n",

Deep neck muscle imbalance of individuals with FHP is of primary concern in clinical rehabilitation. However, there is scarce quantitative research on changes in deep neck muscle length with the head moving forward. This study aimed to investigate changes in deep neck muscle length with different severity levels of FHP. Six Thiel‐embalmed cadavers (four males and two females) were dissected, and 16 deep neck muscles in each cadaver were modeled by a MicroScribe 3D Digitizer in the neutral head posture, slight FHP, and severe FHP. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate the degrees of FHP. Quantitative length change of the deep neck muscles was analyzed using Rhinoceros 3D. In slight FHP significant changes in length occurred in four muscles: two shortened (upper semispinalis capitis, rectus capitis posterior minor) and two lengthened (longus capitis, splenius cervicis). In severe FHP all occipital extensors were significantly shortened (10.6 ± 6.4%), except for obliquus capitis superior, and all cervical extensors were significantly lengthened (4.8 ± 3.4%), while longus capitis (occipital flexor) and the superior oblique part of the longus colli (cervical flexor) were lengthened by 8.8 ± 3.8% and 4.2 ± 3.1%, respectively. No significant length change was observed for the axial rotator. This study presents an alternate anatomical insight into the clinical rehabilitation of FHP.

These signals are recorded via flexible fiber optic cables, which allow neuroimaging experiments to be conducted on participants while performing tasks such as standing or walking. FNIRS has the potential to provide new insights into the evolution of brain activation during ambulatory motor learning tasks and standing tasks to probe balance and vestibular function. In this study, a 32 channel fNIRS system was used to record blood flow changes in the frontal, motor, sensory, and temporal cortices during active balancing associated with playing a video game simulating downhill skiing (Nintendo Wii™; Wii-fit™). Using fNIRS, we found activation of superior temporal gyrus, which was modulated by the difficulty of the balance task.

In theory, somatosensory signals gathered by the hand are accurately mapped in the world-centered (allocentric) reference frame such that the multi-modal information signals, whether visual-tactile or motor-tactile, are perfectly aligned. However, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that the perceived tactile orientation or direction is inaccurate; yielding a surprisingly large perceptual bias. To investigate such perceptual bias, this study presented tactile motion stimuli to healthy adult participants in a variety of finger and head postures, and requested the participants to report the perceived direction of motion mapped on a video screen placed on the frontoparallel plane in front of the eyes. Experimental results showed that the perceptual bias could be divided into systematic and nonsystematic biases. Systematic bias, defined as the mean difference between the perceived and veridical directions, correlated linearly with the relative posture between the finger and the head. By contrast, nonsystematic bias, defined as minor difference in bias for different stimulus directions, was highly individualized, phase-locked to stimulus orientation presented on the skin. Overall, the present findings on systematic bias indicate that the transformation bias among the reference frames is dominated by the finger-to-head posture. Moreover, the highly individualized nature of nonsystematic bias reflects how information is obtained by the orientation-selective units in the S1 cortex.\\nSubject terms: Somatosensory system, Human behaviour</td>\n",

Clarifying this relationship is essential for evaluating interspecific variation in hyoid posture across evolution, and understanding its implications for hyolingual soft tissue function and swallowing motor control. Using Didelphis virginiana as a model, we conducted static manipulation experiments to show that head flexion shifts hyoid position rostrally relative to the cranium across different gapes. IHP-induced shifts in hyoid position along the anteroposterior axis are comparable to in vivo hyoid protraction distance during swallowing. IHP also has opposite effects on passive genio- and stylohyoid muscle lengths. High-speed biplanar videoradiography suggests Didelphis consistently swallows at neutral to flexed posture, with stereotyped hyoid kinematics across different head postures. IHP change can affect suprahyoid muscle force production by shifting their positions on the length-tension curve, and redirecting lines of action and the resultant force from supra- and infrahyoid muscles. We hypothesize that demands on muscle performance may constrain the range of swallowing head postures in mammals.\\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals’.\\nKeywords: biomechanics, muscle physiology, mammal evolution, swallowing, Didelphis virginiana</td>\n",

It is becoming an increasingly popular tool for the assessment of the musculoskeletal system. The aim of this paper is to present a structured method for the analysis of posture and its changes using a standardized digital photography technique.\\nMaterial and methods\\nThe purpose of the study was twofold. The first one comprised 91 children (44 girls and 47 boys) aged 7–10 (8.2 ± 1.0), i.e., students of primary school, and its aim was to develop the photographic method, choose the quantitative parameters, and determine the intraobserver reliability (repeatability) along with the interobserver reliability (reproducibility) measurements in sagittal plane using digital photography, as well as to compare the Rippstein plurimeter and digital photography measurements. The second one involved 7782 children (3804 girls, 3978 boys) aged 7–10 (8.4 ± 0.5), who underwent digital photography postural screening. The methods consisted in measuring and calculating selected parameters, establishing the normal ranges of photographic parameters, presenting percentile charts, as well as noticing common pitfalls and possible sources of errors in digital photography.\\nResults\\nA standardized procedure for the photographic evaluation of child body posture was presented. The photographic measurements revealed very good intra- and inter-rater reliability regarding the five sagittal parameters and good reliability performed against Rippstein plurimeter measurements. The parameters displayed insignificant variability over time. Normative data were calculated based on photographic assessment, while the percentile charts were provided to serve as reference values. The technical errors observed during photogrammetry are carefully discussed in this article.\\nConclusions\\nTechnical developments are allowed for the regular use of digital photogrammetry in body posture assessment. Specific child positioning (described above) enables us to avoid incidentally modified posture. Image registration is simple, quick, harmless, and cost-effective. The semi-automatic image analysis, together with the normal values and percentile charts, makes the technique reliable in terms of child’s posture documentation and corrective therapy effects’ monitoring.\\nElectronic supplementary material\\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13013-017-0146-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\\nKeywords: Standardization, Digital photography, Photogrammetry, Percentile charts, Normative data, Primary school children</td>\n",

       "      <td>Go to:\\nAbstract\\nBackground\\nThe physiological sagittal spinal curvature represents a typical feature of good body posture in the sagittal plane. The cervical and the lumbar spine are curved anteriorly (lordosis), while the thoracic segment is curved posteriorly (kyphosis). The pelvis is inclined anteriorly, and the lower limbs’ joints remain in a neutral position. However, there are many deviations from the optimal body alignment.\\nThe aim of this paper is to present the most common types of non-structural misalignments of the body posture in the sagittal plane.\\nMain body of the abstract\\nThe most common types of non-structural misalignments of body posture in the sagittal plane are as follows: (1) lordotic, (2) kyphotic, (3) flat-back, and (4) sway-back postures. Each one may influence both the skeletal and the muscular system leading to the functional disturbance and an increased strain of the supporting structures. Usually, the disturbances localized within the muscles are analyzed in respect to their shortening or lengthening. However, according to suggestions presented in the literature, when the muscles responsible for maintaining good body posture (the so-called stabilizers) are not being stimulated to resist against gravity for an extended period of time, e.g., during prolonged sitting, their stabilizing function is disturbed by the hypoactivity reaction resulting in muscular weakness. The deficit of the locomotor system stability triggers a compensatory mechanism—the stabilizing function is overtaken by the so-called mobilizing muscles. However, as a side effect, such compensation leads to the increased activity of mobilizers (hyperactivity) and decreased flexibility, which may finally lead to the pathological chain of reaction within the musculoskeletal system.\\nConclusions\\nThere exist four principal types of non-structural body posture misalignments in the sagittal plane: lordotic posture, kyphotic posture, flat-back posture, and sway-back posture. Each of them can disturb the physiological loading of the musculoskeletal system in a specific way, which may lead to a functional disorder.\\nWhen planning postural corrective exercises, not only the analysis of muscles in respect to their shortening and lengthening but also their hypoactivity and hyperactivity should be considered.\\nKeywords: Body posture, Corrective exercises, Faults of body posture, Lordotic posture, Kyphotic posture, Flat-back posture, Sway-back posture</td>\n",

In theory, somatosensory signals gathered by the hand are accurately mapped in the world-centered (allocentric) reference frame such that the multi-modal information signals, whether visual-tactile or motor-tactile, are perfectly aligned. However, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that the perceived tactile orientation or direction is inaccurate; yielding a surprisingly large perceptual bias. To investigate such perceptual bias, this study presented tactile motion stimuli to healthy adult participants in a variety of finger and head postures, and requested the participants to report the perceived direction of motion mapped on a video screen placed on the frontoparallel plane in front of the eyes. Experimental results showed that the perceptual bias could be divided into systematic and nonsystematic biases. Systematic bias, defined as the mean difference between the perceived and veridical directions, correlated linearly with the relative posture between the finger and the head. By contrast, nonsystematic bias, defined as minor difference in bias for different stimulus directions, was highly individualized, phase-locked to stimulus orientation presented on the skin. Overall, the present findings on systematic bias indicate that the transformation bias among the reference frames is dominated by the finger-to-head posture. Moreover, the highly individualized nature of nonsystematic bias reflects how information is obtained by the orientation-selective units in the S1 cortex.\\nSubject terms: Somatosensory system, Human behaviour    \n",

Clarifying this relationship is essential for evaluating interspecific variation in hyoid posture across evolution, and understanding its implications for hyolingual soft tissue function and swallowing motor control. Using Didelphis virginiana as a model, we conducted static manipulation experiments to show that head flexion shifts hyoid position rostrally relative to the cranium across different gapes. IHP-induced shifts in hyoid position along the anteroposterior axis are comparable to in vivo hyoid protraction distance during swallowing. IHP also has opposite effects on passive genio- and stylohyoid muscle lengths. High-speed biplanar videoradiography suggests Didelphis consistently swallows at neutral to flexed posture, with stereotyped hyoid kinematics across different head postures. IHP change can affect suprahyoid muscle force production by shifting their positions on the length-tension curve, and redirecting lines of action and the resultant force from supra- and infrahyoid muscles. We hypothesize that demands on muscle performance may constrain the range of swallowing head postures in mammals.\\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals’.\\nKeywords: biomechanics, muscle physiology, mammal evolution, swallowing, Didelphis virginiana    \n",

It is becoming an increasingly popular tool for the assessment of the musculoskeletal system. The aim of this paper is to present a structured method for the analysis of posture and its changes using a standardized digital photography technique.\\nMaterial and methods\\nThe purpose of the study was twofold. The first one comprised 91 children (44 girls and 47 boys) aged 7–10 (8.2 ± 1.0), i.e., students of primary school, and its aim was to develop the photographic method, choose the quantitative parameters, and determine the intraobserver reliability (repeatability) along with the interobserver reliability (reproducibility) measurements in sagittal plane using digital photography, as well as to compare the Rippstein plurimeter and digital photography measurements. The second one involved 7782 children (3804 girls, 3978 boys) aged 7–10 (8.4 ± 0.5), who underwent digital photography postural screening. The methods consisted in measuring and calculating selected parameters, establishing the normal ranges of photographic parameters, presenting percentile charts, as well as noticing common pitfalls and possible sources of errors in digital photography.\\nResults\\nA standardized procedure for the photographic evaluation of child body posture was presented. The photographic measurements revealed very good intra- and inter-rater reliability regarding the five sagittal parameters and good reliability performed against Rippstein plurimeter measurements. The parameters displayed insignificant variability over time. Normative data were calculated based on photographic assessment, while the percentile charts were provided to serve as reference values. The technical errors observed during photogrammetry are carefully discussed in this article.\\nConclusions\\nTechnical developments are allowed for the regular use of digital photogrammetry in body posture assessment. Specific child positioning (described above) enables us to avoid incidentally modified posture. Image registration is simple, quick, harmless, and cost-effective. The semi-automatic image analysis, together with the normal values and percentile charts, makes the technique reliable in terms of child’s posture documentation and corrective therapy effects’ monitoring.\\nElectronic supplementary material\\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13013-017-0146-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\\nKeywords: Standardization, Digital photography, Photogrammetry, Percentile charts, Normative data, Primary school children    \n",

The cervical and the lumbar spine are curved anteriorly (lordosis), while the thoracic segment is curved posteriorly (kyphosis). The pelvis is inclined anteriorly, and the lower limbs’ joints remain in a neutral position. However, there are many deviations from the optimal body alignment.\\nThe aim of this paper is to present the most common types of non-structural misalignments of the body posture in the sagittal plane.\\nMain body of the abstract\\nThe most common types of non-structural misalignments of body posture in the sagittal plane are as follows: (1) lordotic, (2) kyphotic, (3) flat-back, and (4) sway-back postures. Each one may influence both the skeletal and the muscular system leading to the functional disturbance and an increased strain of the supporting structures. Usually, the disturbances localized within the muscles are analyzed in respect to their shortening or lengthening. However, according to suggestions presented in the literature, when the muscles responsible for maintaining good body posture (the so-called stabilizers) are not being stimulated to resist against gravity for an extended period of time, e.g., during prolonged sitting, their stabilizing function is disturbed by the hypoactivity reaction resulting in muscular weakness. The deficit of the locomotor system stability triggers a compensatory mechanism—the stabilizing function is overtaken by the so-called mobilizing muscles. However, as a side effect, such compensation leads to the increased activity of mobilizers (hyperactivity) and decreased flexibility, which may finally lead to the pathological chain of reaction within the musculoskeletal system.\\nConclusions\\nThere exist four principal types of non-structural body posture misalignments in the sagittal plane: lordotic posture, kyphotic posture, flat-back posture, and sway-back posture. Each of them can disturb the physiological loading of the musculoskeletal system in a specific way, which may lead to a functional disorder.\\nWhen planning postural corrective exercises, not only the analysis of muscles in respect to their shortening and lengthening but also their hypoactivity and hyperactivity should be considered.\\nKeywords: Body posture, Corrective exercises, Faults of body posture, Lordotic posture, Kyphotic posture, Flat-back posture, Sway-back posture    \n",

We demonstrate our system’s performance in sitting posture and seated stretch recognition tasks with over 98.82% accuracy in recognizing 15 different sitting postures and 97.94% in recognizing six seated stretches. We also show that user BMI divergence significantly affects posture recognition accuracy using machine learning. We validate our method’s performance in five different real-world workplace environments and discuss training strategies for the machine learning models. Finally, we propose the first smart posture data-driven stretch recommendation system in alignment with physiotherapy standards.\\nKeywords: posture recognition, applied machine learning, IoT, pressure sensing, human well-being    \n",

Deep neck muscle imbalance of individuals with FHP is of primary concern in clinical rehabilitation. However, there is scarce quantitative research on changes in deep neck muscle length with the head moving forward. This study aimed to investigate changes in deep neck muscle length with different severity levels of FHP. Six Thiel‐embalmed cadavers (four males and two females) were dissected, and 16 deep neck muscles in each cadaver were modeled by a MicroScribe 3D Digitizer in the neutral head posture, slight FHP, and severe FHP. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate the degrees of FHP. Quantitative length change of the deep neck muscles was analyzed using Rhinoceros 3D. In slight FHP significant changes in length occurred in four muscles: two shortened (upper semispinalis capitis, rectus capitis posterior minor) and two lengthened (longus capitis, splenius cervicis). In severe FHP all occipital extensors were significantly shortened (10.6 ± 6.4%), except for obliquus capitis superior, and all cervical extensors were significantly lengthened (4.8 ± 3.4%), while longus capitis (occipital flexor) and the superior oblique part of the longus colli (cervical flexor) were lengthened by 8.8 ± 3.8% and 4.2 ± 3.1%, respectively. No significant length change was observed for the axial rotator. This study presents an alternate anatomical insight into the clinical rehabilitation of FHP.

Observational studies, non-randomised studies with single group and reviews will be excluded. We will consider the following outcome measures: postural variables of FHP, neck pain, performance-based functional disability scores of the neck, quality of life, basic activities of daily living and work-related outcomes. The unique citations will be screened by titles/abstracts and full texts, independently. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool will be used to critically appraise the included studies. The risk of bias and data abstraction of included studies will be undertaken independently.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of selective corrective exercises (SCEs) on the craniovertebral angle (CVA) and shoulder angle (SA) in students with FHP and to establish MCID for these angles.\\nMethods\\nIn this randomized clinical trial study, a total of 103 second-grade male students with FHP were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. CVA and SA of participants were measured before and after the 8-week selective corrective exercise program (including strengthening and stretching exercises). The photogrammetric method was used to measure CVA and SA. MCID value was calculated for CVA and SA using the distribution method.\\nResults\\nThe results showed that there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of CVA (F = 89.04, P = 0.005, Effect size = 0.47) and SA (F = 18.83, P = 0.005, Effect size = 0.16). After eight weeks of selective corrective exercises, the MCID values of CVA and SA were 1.40° and 1.34°, respectively.\\nConclusion\\nThis study revealed that the selective corrective exercises might lead to postural correction of students having FHP problem. Results further indicated that a corrective exercise program would be considered beneficial if it increased CVA and SA values at least 1.40 and 1.34 degrees, respectively.\\nSupplementary Information\\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12887-022-03300-7.\\nKeywords: Posture, Head, Shoulder, Exercise, Minimal clinically important difference</td>\n",

The network connectivity is a variant of center-surround architecture that we call center-annular-surround (CAS). In this architecture each neuron is excited by nearby neighbors and inhibited by more distant neighbors in an annular-surround region. The neural units of these networks simulate conductance-based spiking neurons that interact via mechanisms susceptible to both short-term synaptic plasticity and STDP. We show that such CAS networks display robust WTA behavior unlike the center-surround networks and other control architectures that we have studied. We find that a large-scale network of spiking neurons with separate populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can give rise to smooth maps of sensory input. In addition, we show that a humanoid brain-based-device (BBD) under the control of a spiking WTA neural network can learn to reach to target positions in its visual field, thus demonstrating the acquisition of sensorimotor coordination.\\nKeywords: brain-based computational model, spiking neuronal networks, winner-take-all, motor control and learning/plasticity, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, sensorimotor control, large-scale spiking neural networks, neurorobotics</td>\n",

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of spinal factors including total spinal alignment and spinal ROM on knee OA in community-living elderly subjects. A total of 170 subjects ≥60 years old (mean age 69.4 years, 70 males and 100 females) enrolled in the study (Yakumo study) and underwent a basic health checkup. We evaluated A-P knee radiographs, sagittal parameters (thoracic kyphosis angle, lumbar lordosis angle, and spinal inclination angle) and spinal mobility (thoracic spinal ROM, lumbar spinal ROM and total spinal ROM) as determined with SpinalMouse®. The radiological assessment of knee OA was based on the Kellgren and Lawrence classification, and the knee flexion angle was measured while the subject was standing. Spinal inclination angle and thoracic spinal ROM correlated significantly with knee OA on univariate analyses. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that an increase in spinal inclination angle (OR 1.073, p&lt;0.05) was significantly associated with knee OA. Spinal inclination angle had significant positive correlation with knee flexion angle (r=0.286, p&lt;0.001). The spinal inclination angle is the most important factor associated with knee OA.\\nKey Words: spinal imbalance, spinal inclination, knee osteoarthritis, elderly, knee-spine syndrome</td>\n",

These signals are recorded via flexible fiber optic cables, which allow neuroimaging experiments to be conducted on participants while performing tasks such as standing or walking. FNIRS has the potential to provide new insights into the evolution of brain activation during ambulatory motor learning tasks and standing tasks to probe balance and vestibular function. In this study, a 32 channel fNIRS system was used to record blood flow changes in the frontal, motor, sensory, and temporal cortices during active balancing associated with playing a video game simulating downhill skiing (Nintendo Wii™; Wii-fit™). Using fNIRS, we found activation of superior temporal gyrus, which was modulated by the difficulty of the balance task. This region had been previously implicated in vestibular function from other animal and human studies.\\nKeywords: Brain imaging, Brain Function, Neuroimaging, Balance, Near-infrared spectroscopy, Vestibular cortex</td>\n",

Deep neck muscle imbalance of individuals with FHP is of primary concern in clinical rehabilitation. However, there is scarce quantitative research on changes in deep neck muscle length with the head moving forward. This study aimed to investigate changes in deep neck muscle length with different severity levels of FHP. Six Thiel‐embalmed cadavers (four males and two females) were dissected, and 16 deep neck muscles in each cadaver were modeled by a MicroScribe 3D Digitizer in the neutral head posture, slight FHP, and severe FHP. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate the degrees of FHP. Quantitative length change of the deep neck muscles was analyzed using Rhinoceros 3D. In slight FHP significant changes in length occurred in four muscles: two shortened (upper semispinalis capitis, rectus capitis posterior minor) and two lengthened (longus capitis, splenius cervicis). In severe FHP all occipital extensors were significantly shortened (10.6 ± 6.4%), except for obliquus capitis superior, and all cervical extensors were significantly lengthened (4.8 ± 3.4%), while longus capitis (occipital flexor) and the superior oblique part of the longus colli (cervical flexor) were lengthened by 8.8 ± 3.8% and 4.2 ± 3.1%, respectively. No significant length change was observed for the axial rotator. This study presents an alternate anatomical insight into the clinical rehabilitation of FHP. Six muscles appear to be important in restoring optimal head posture, with improvements in FHP being related to interventions associated with the occipital and cervical extensors.\\nKeywords: cervical spine, deep neck muscles, forward head posture, muscle length change    \n",

The study utilized a systematic review and meta-analysis approach to investigate the effects of various therapeutic exercises on forward head posture, rounded shoulders, and hyperkyphosis associated with upper crossed syndrome.\\nMethods\\nThe study identified relevant keywords for each independent and dependent variable and conducted a search in scientific databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, without any time limitations until 12 August 2023. Overall, 4625 articles were found in the selected databases, which were reduced to 1085 after being entered into the EndNote software and removing duplicate data. The full texts of 30 remaining studies were reviewed; ten articles meeting the criteria were included. Additionally, 12 studies from the Google Scholar database were included, resulting in 22 studies. Using Comprehensive meta-analysis software (CMA ver 3), data heterogeneity was measured with I2 and the Q tests. The Funnel Plot and Egger test methods were utilized to determine the possibility of publication bias. The JBI checklist was used to assess the quality of the studies.\\nResults\\nThe results of the meta-analysis showed that therapeutic exercises were effective in improving forward head, rounded shoulders, and thoracic kyphosis angles (CI 95% = -1.85–1.161, P = 0.001, P = 0.001, CI95%=-1.822–1.15, and P = 0.001, CI 95%= -1.83–1.09, respectively).\\nConclusion\\nBased on the results, it appears that performing therapeutic exercises in the form of strength exercises, stretching, shoulder-based exercises, and incredibly comprehensive exercises that target all muscles may be effective in reducing forward head, rounded shoulders, thoracic kyphosis, and overall UCS.\\nLevel of evidence\\n1\\nSupplementary Information\\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12891-024-07224-4.\\nKeywords: Upper crossed syndrome, Forward head, Forward shoulder, Round shoulder, Kyphosis    \n",

It is believed to be one of the predisposing factors for the development of mechanical neck pain (MNP). We propose doing a systematic review to find the effectiveness of interventions targeted on FHP with MNP and assess implementation fidelity associated with these interventions.\\nMethods and analysis\\nMedline (PubMed), Web of Science (Social Science Citation Index), EMBASE, Scopus, PEDro and CINAHL databases will be searched for studies published in English from their inception. Forward and backward citations of the included studies will be investigated for identifying additional records. We will include randomised controlled trials and non/quasi-experimental studies with two groups assessing the effectiveness of interventions targeted on FHP with MNP. Observational studies, non-randomised studies with single group and reviews will be excluded. We will consider the following outcome measures: postural variables of FHP, neck pain, performance-based functional disability scores of the neck, quality of life, basic activities of daily living and work-related outcomes. The unique citations will be screened by titles/abstracts and full texts, independently. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool will be used to critically appraise the included studies. The risk of bias and data abstraction of included studies will be undertaken independently. A qualitative synthesis will be conducted and, if sufficient studies with comparable outcome measures are available, we will statistically pool the result.\\nEthics and dissemination\\nWe will undertake a systematic review of primary studies, and will not directly recruit participants hence, ethical clearance is not applicable. We will aim to present the findings of the completed systematic review at an international conference and subsequently submit the manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal for publication.\\nPROSPERO registration number\\nCRD42021250310.\\nKeywords: rehabilitation medicine, musculoskeletal disorders, occupational & industrial medicine, spine    \n",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of selective corrective exercises (SCEs) on the craniovertebral angle (CVA) and shoulder angle (SA) in students with FHP and to establish MCID for these angles.\\nMethods\\nIn this randomized clinical trial study, a total of 103 second-grade male students with FHP were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. CVA and SA of participants were measured before and after the 8-week selective corrective exercise program (including strengthening and stretching exercises). The photogrammetric method was used to measure CVA and SA. MCID value was calculated for CVA and SA using the distribution method.\\nResults\\nThe results showed that there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of CVA (F = 89.04, P = 0.005, Effect size = 0.47) and SA (F = 18.83, P = 0.005, Effect size = 0.16). After eight weeks of selective corrective exercises, the MCID values of CVA and SA were 1.40° and 1.34°, respectively.\\nConclusion\\nThis study revealed that the selective corrective exercises might lead to postural correction of students having FHP problem. Results further indicated that a corrective exercise program would be considered beneficial if it increased CVA and SA values at least 1.40 and 1.34 degrees, respectively.\\nSupplementary Information\\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12887-022-03300-7.\\nKeywords: Posture, Head, Shoulder, Exercise, Minimal clinically important difference    \n",

EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from their inception to August 2020. The quality of evidence for variables used in the meta-analysis was determined using the GRADE system. Five studies satisfied the criteria for data analysis. All studies included individuals without any spinal symptoms. Data from five studies on neck angle showed a statistically significant (p = 0.02) overall effect (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.77), indicating a lesser neck flexion angle while sitting with a lumbar roll than without it. Data from two studies on head angle showed a statistically significant (p = 0.04) overall effect (SMD = 0.47), indicating a lesser head extension angle while sitting with a lumbar roll than without it. In each meta-analysis, the quality of evidence was very low in the GRADE system.

The network connectivity is a variant of center-surround architecture that we call center-annular-surround (CAS). In this architecture each neuron is excited by nearby neighbors and inhibited by more distant neighbors in an annular-surround region. The neural units of these networks simulate conductance-based spiking neurons that interact via mechanisms susceptible to both short-term synaptic plasticity and STDP. We show that such CAS networks display robust WTA behavior unlike the center-surround networks and other control architectures that we have studied. We find that a large-scale network of spiking neurons with separate populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can give rise to smooth maps of sensory input. In addition, we show that a humanoid brain-based-device (BBD) under the control of a spiking WTA neural network can learn to reach to target positions in its visual field, thus demonstrating the acquisition of sensorimotor coordination.\\nKeywords: brain-based computational model, spiking neuronal networks, winner-take-all, motor control and learning/plasticity, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, sensorimotor control, large-scale spiking neural networks, neurorobotics    \n",

All volunteers were seated in the rear seat position of the bullet vehicle. Closing velocities ranged from 4.1 to 8.3 mph (mean, 6.7 mph). For the bullet vehicle, the delta V ranged from 1.4 to 3.9 mph with a mean of 2.8 mph.\\nResults\\nEighty-eight percent of volunteers attributed symptoms of discomfort to their crash exposure. All reported symptoms were transient, and none required medical treatment. The mean duration was 1 day.\\nConclusions\\nEven at relatively low speeds, there is no lower threshold below which it can be reasonably assumed that healthy and prepared volunteer rear seat passengers will not sustain some level of minor injury in a frontal collision. Although the reported mean delta V for injured persons in real-world frontal crashes has been reported to be as high as 8.1 mph, this does not offer any insight into the minimum threshold for such injuries among all at-risk vehicle occupants.\\nKey indexing terms: Whiplash injuries, Motor vehicles, Chiropractic    \n",

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of spinal factors including total spinal alignment and spinal ROM on knee OA in community-living elderly subjects. A total of 170 subjects ≥60 years old (mean age 69.4 years, 70 males and 100 females) enrolled in the study (Yakumo study) and underwent a basic health checkup. We evaluated A-P knee radiographs, sagittal parameters (thoracic kyphosis angle, lumbar lordosis angle, and spinal inclination angle) and spinal mobility (thoracic spinal ROM, lumbar spinal ROM and total spinal ROM) as determined with SpinalMouse®. The radiological assessment of knee OA was based on the Kellgren and Lawrence classification, and the knee flexion angle was measured while the subject was standing. Spinal inclination angle and thoracic spinal ROM correlated significantly with knee OA on univariate analyses. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that an increase in spinal inclination angle (OR 1.073, p<0.05) was significantly associated with knee OA. Spinal inclination angle had significant positive correlation with knee flexion angle (r=0.286, p<0.001). The spinal inclination angle is the most important factor associated with knee OA.\\nKey Words: spinal imbalance, spinal inclination, knee osteoarthritis, elderly, knee-spine syndrome    \n",

Kinematic state information is naturally represented in the firing rates of primary afferent neurons, which may be recorded with multi-electrode arrays at the level of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Previous work in cats has shown that it is feasible to estimate the kinematic state of the hind limb with a multivariate linear regression model of the neural activity in the DRG. In this study we extend these results to estimate the limb state in real-time during intramuscular stimulation in an anesthetized cat. Furthermore, we used the limb state estimates as feedback to a finite state FES controller to generate rudimentary walking behavior. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using DRG activity in a closed-loop FES system.    \n",

These signals are recorded via flexible fiber optic cables, which allow neuroimaging experiments to be conducted on participants while performing tasks such as standing or walking. FNIRS has the potential to provide new insights into the evolution of brain activation during ambulatory motor learning tasks and standing tasks to probe balance and vestibular function. In this study, a 32 channel fNIRS system was used to record blood flow changes in the frontal, motor, sensory, and temporal cortices during active balancing associated with playing a video game simulating downhill skiing (Nintendo Wii™; Wii-fit™). Using fNIRS, we found activation of superior temporal gyrus, which was modulated by the difficulty of the balance task.
