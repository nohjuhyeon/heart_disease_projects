  "title": "Effects of scapular treatment on chronic neck pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
  "date": "2024 Apr 1",
  "abstract": "Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p < 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study."

  "title": "Association between smartphone addiction and myofascial trigger points",
  "date": "2024 Apr 1",
  "abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between smartphone addiction and miyafascial trigger points in university students.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study of university students was conducted for the purpose of this study. The participants were assessed based on age, gender, dominant side, the amount of time they spent on their smartphones, the purpose of their use, and their posture. The Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Form (SAS-SF) was used to determine addictes and non-addicts. The cut-off value of SAS-SF is 31 and above for male and 33 and above for female.\nResults: There were 136 participants in the study. The posture score for addicts and non-addicts ones was not significantly different (p > 0,05), but the number of trigger points, maximal bending posture and trigger points in the right levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles were significantly higher in the smartphone addict participants (p < 0,05).\nConclusions: Smartphone addiction in university students is associated with postural changes and trigger points in the bilateral levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles. Public health programs should be developed to raise awareness about smartphone addiction, encourage screen breaks, and emphasize physical activity and exercise regularly."

  "title": "Effects of Telerehabilitation Combining Diaphragmatic Breathing Re-Education and Shoulder Stabilization Exercises on Neck Pain, Posture, and Function in Young Adult Men with Upper Crossed Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "date": "2024 Mar 11",
  "abstract": "Background: Forward head posture and rounded shoulder posture are common postural variants found in upper crossed syndrome, which can lead to limited neck mobility, respiratory problems, and other issues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj < 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj < 0.05/4) for the Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the telerehabilitation training group, which included diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, was more effective in improving Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD in males with UCS."

  "abstract": "The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Myofascial Release Technique (MRT) along with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) on pain, craniovertebral angle (CVA), and neck disability in university students with chronic neck pain and forward head posture. A total of sixty-six eligible participants with chronic neck pain and forward head posture were randomized into the Myofascial Release Therapy (MRT) group (n = 33) and MRT and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) group (n = 33). Clinical outcomes included neck pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale, neck disability measured through the neck disability index, and forward head posture measured through the cranial vertebral angle. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and the four and eight weeks after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain intensity, CVA, and neck disability after the intervention. However, the CBT group demonstrated greater improvements than the MRT group. The difference in outcomes between the groups was statistically significant. Myofascial Release Therapy combined with CBT is an effective treatment method for patients with chronic neck pain and forward head posture."

  "date": "2024 Mar 26",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to compare sensory organization test and postural control strategies between individuals with mild and moderate-to-severe forward head posture (FHP).\nMethods: A sensory organization test (SOT) was performed in 6 conditions using computerized dynamic posturography, to assess postural control. Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P < .05) and strategy scores (P < .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P < .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P > .05).\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits."

  "date": "2024 Apr 1",
  "abstract": "Background: Neck and jaw pain is common and is associated with jaw functional limitations, postural stability, muscular endurance, and proprioception. This study aimed to investigate the effect of jaw and neck pain on craniocervico- mandibular functions and postural stability in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs).\nMethods: Fifty-two patients with TMJDs were included and assessed using Fonseca's Questionnaire and the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index. An isometric strength test was performed for the TMJ depressor and cervical muscles. The TMJ position sense (TMJPS) test and cervical joint position error test (CJPET) were employed for proprioception. Total sway degree was obtained for the assessment of postural stability. Deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE) was assessed using the craniocervical flexion test. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was employed to assess mandibular function, and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured for forward head posture.\nResults: Jaw and neck pain negatively affected CVA (R2 = 0.130), TMJPS (R2 = 0.286), DNFE (R2 = 0.355), TMJ depressor (R2 = 0.145), cervical flexor (R2 = 0.144), and extensor (R2 = 0.148) muscle strength. Jaw and neck pain also positively affected CJPET for flexion (R2 = 0.116) and extension (R2 = 0.146), as well as total sway degree (R2 = 0.128) and MFIQ (R2 = 0.230).\nConclusions: Patients with painful TMJDs, could have impaired muscle strength and proprioception of the TMJ and cervical region. The jaw and neck pain could also affect postural stability, and the endurance of deep neck flexors as well as mandibular functions in TMJDs."

  "title": "Effect of smartphone use on cervical spine stability",
  "date": "2024 Mar 18",
  "abstract": "Using a smartphone often involves a sustained head-forward tilt posture, which may deteriorate the mechanism of muscle reaction efficiency or reduce the stiffness of connective tissues of the cervical spine. These changes in muscular and connective tissues can impair cervical spine stability and contribute to developing neck pain symptoms. In this experiment, change in the cervical spine stability associated with a sustained smartphone use posture was evaluated by quantifying the effective stiffness and the reflexive responses of the head to sudden perturbations. Seventeen young smartphone users maintained their heads tilted forward approximately 30° for 30 min while watching videos on their smartphones in sitting. Data show that the measures of cervical spine stability did not change significantly after the smartphone use task despite developing mild to moderate neck and upper body discomfort symptoms. Study findings imply that keeping the head tilt posture for 30 min for smartphone use did not significantly alter spinal stability, rejecting its association with neck discomfort."

  "date": "2024 Mar 15.",
  "abstract": "Background: Jaw clenching improves dynamic reactive balance on an oscillating platform during forward acceleration and is associated with decreased mean sway speed of different body regions.\nObjective: It is suggested that jaw clenching as a concurrent muscle activity facilitates human motor excitability, increasing the neural drive to distal muscles. The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon was studied based on leg and trunk muscle activity (iEMG) and co-contraction ratio (CCR).\nMethods: Forty-eight physically active and healthy adults were assigned to three groups, performing three oral motor tasks (jaw clenching, tongue pressing against the palate or habitual lower jaw position) during a dynamic one-legged stance reactive balance task on an oscillating platform. The iEMG and CCR of posture-relevant muscles and muscle pairs were analysed during platform forward acceleration.\nResults: Tongue pressing caused an adjustment of co-contraction patterns of distal muscle groups based on changes in biomechanical coupling between the head and trunk during static balancing at the beginning of the experiment. Neither iEMG nor CCR measurement helped detect a general neuromuscular effect of jaw clenching on the dynamic reactive balance.\nConclusion: The findings might indicate the existence of robust fixed patterns of rapid postural responses during the important initial phases of balance recovery."

  "title": "Lumbar and neck injuries of occupants in different reclining postures",
  "date": "2024 Feb 23",
  "abstract": "Purpose: With the increasing level of automation in automobiles, the advent of autonomous vehicles has reduced the tendency of drivers and passengers to focus on the task of driving. The increasing automation in automobiles reduced the drivers' and passengers' focus on driving, which allowed occupants to choose a more relaxed and comfortable sitting position. Meanwhile, the occupant's sitting position went from a frontal, upright position to a more relaxed and reclined one, which resulted in the existing restraint systems can not to keep occupants safe and secure. This study aimed to determine the effects of different reclining states on occupants' lumbar and neck injuries.\nMethods: This is an original research on the field of automotive safety engineering. Occupants in different initial seating positions (25°, 35°, 45°, and 55°) were adapted to changes in seat back angle and restraint systems and placed in the same frontal impact environment. Neck injury indexes, lumbar axial compression force and acceleration, as well as occupant dynamic response during the impact, were compared in different seating positions. The injury response and kinematic characteristics of occupants in different reclining positions were analyzed by the control variable method.\nResults: As the sitting angle increased, the occupant's head acceleration decreased, and the forward-lean angle decreased. Occupants in the standard sitting position had the greatest neck injury, with an Nij of 0.95, and were susceptible to abbreviated injury scale 2+ cervical medullary injuries. As the seatback angle increased, the geometric position of the lumbar spine tended to be horizontal, and the impact load transmitted greater forces to the lumbar spine. The occupant's lumbar injury was greatest in the lying position, with a peak axial compression force on the lumbar region of 5.5 KN, which was 2.3 KN greater than in the standard sitting position.\nConclusion: The study of occupant lumbar and neck injuries based on different recline states can provide a theoretical basis for optimizing lumbar evaluation indexes, which is conducive to the understanding of the lumbar injury mechanism and the comprehensive consideration of occupant safety protection."

  "title": "An affordable and immersive virtual reality-based exercise therapy in forward head posture",
  "date": "2024 Mar 6",
  "abstract": "Forward Head Posture (FHP) is one of the most commonly occurring musculoskeletal abnormalities. Despite exercise therapy being an effective approach for FHP treatment, it can be long, monotonous, and tedious. Virtual reality (VR) can be used as an innovative solution to address these challenges. We designed an affordable and immersive VR-based exercise therapy (VRET) system for FHP correction. The VRET contents (i.e., exercises and VR scenarios) were determined by physiotherapists and game designers at the focus group meetings. Hardware requirements include a VR box, smartphone, and sensors (i.e., a smartphone accelerometer and an affordable Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)) to measure head motions and transfer them via Wi-Fi to the VRET system. The IMU was designed using the MPU6050, Arduino Nano, and ESP8266-01S. Gwet's AC1, Game Experience Questionnaires (GEQ), and System Usability Scale (SUS) were used to measure intra-rater reliability, user experience, and system usability, respectively. The determined exercises, including Capital Flexion-Extension and Chin Tuck, were designed in the form of a shooting game. A physiotherapist and twenty-one FHP individuals took part in evaluating the system. High precision was obtained for the designed IMU (i.e., pitch and roll < 0.1° and yaw < 1.3 °). Gwet's AC1 and SUS results showed very good intra-rater reliability (coefficient = 0.892) and excellent usability (score = 87.14), respectively. According to the mean scores of the GEQ, participants were confident about competence, immersion, flow, and positive affect components. The development of low-cost VRET systems for FHP correction is a step towards facilitating rehabilitation challenges by providing positive experiences for users as well as helping them perform therapeutic exercises correctly."

  "date": "2024 Jan-Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Forward head posture (FHP) decreases the neck position sense and creates tension in the neck muscles, which inversely affects the mechanics of the distal joints through body myofascia. Thus, this study investigated the effects of FHP on neck and ankle joint position sense, and conducted a comparison between the joint position sense of the right and left ankle.\nMethods: Fifty-seven subjects were assigned according to the craniovertebral angle (CVA) into the FHP group (CVA <49°; n = 27) or the control group (CVA >49°; n = 30). Head and ankle joint repositioning accuracy was measured by using a cervical range-of-motion device and an isokinetic dynamometer, respectively.\nResults: There was a significant increase in the joint position error (JPE) of the cervical flexion, extension, and right and left side bending motions of the FHP group compared to the control group (P < .05). There were significant increases in the JPE of the right and left ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the FHP group compared to the healthy group (P < .05). Moreover, the JPE of the right ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the FHP group were significantly higher than the left ankle (P < .05).\nConclusions: The FHP decreases the position sense of cervical flexion, extension, and right and left side bending motions, and the plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of both ankle joints, especially the right ankle joint."

STEG included progressive strengthening, proprioceptive, and stabilization exercises. All participants were assessed before treatment, at the end of the 8th week treatment period and at the 12th week post-treatment follow-up. Cranio-vertebral angle measurement, Fonseca's Questionnaire, Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index, TMJ position test, cervical joint position error test and postural stability assessment were used.\nResults: The TMJ and cervical joint position sense, total sway degree, area gap percentage, sway velocity and antero-posterior body sway results showed significant improvement in the STEG compared to the CG (p< 0.05), however medio-lateral body sway did not differ between groups (p> 0.05).\nConclusions: Postural stability, TMJ and cervical joint position sense appear to be affected in individuals with CCM malalignment. Our results showed that an exercise program including ST stabilization, proprioception and strengthening of the scapular muscles may be effective in the management of CCM malalignment and will allow clinicians to plan holistic treatment."

  "abstract": "Background: Head posture deviation is seen in 52.5 % of children aged 6-15 years. Studies have shown that poor posture habits can impair muscle function during craniofacial growth and development. A muscle imbalance causes abnormal positioning of dental and skeletal structures, a condition that exerts negative impacts, such as changes in facial morphology.\nObjective: To determine through photometric analysis the relationship between craniovertebral angle as a function of head posture and glabella-subnasale-pogonion (G-Sn-Pg) angle as a function of facial profile in 10-12-year-old children, and the results will help to avoid facial development issues.\nMethods: Thirty-three subjects met the inclusion criteria. Their craniovertebral angles and facial profiles were measured using lateral photometry and ImageJ. The craniovertebral angle was determined by connecting the tragus and C7 with a horizontal line, whereas the facial profile angle was determined by connecting the glabella, subnasale, and pogonion. The relationship between the craniovertebral and G-Sn-Pg angle values was analyzed using the Pearson correlation test.\nResults: A significant relationship was observed between the craniovertebral angle and the G-Sn- Pg angle (p < 0.05), although such a relationship was weak (r = 0.373).\nConclusion: A more forward head posture is associated with a more convex facial profile, and this relationship is useful for the early prevention and treatment."

  "title": "A Preliminary Diagnostic Model for Forward Head Posture among Adolescents Using Forward Neck Tilt Angle and Radiographic Sagittal Alignment Parameters",
  "date": "2024 Feb 11",
  "abstract": "Despite numerous attempts to correct forward head posture (FHP), definitive evidence-based screening and diagnostic methods remain elusive. This study proposes a preliminary diagnostic methodology for FHP, utilizing a noninvasive body angle measurement system as a screening test for FHP and incorporating radiological parameters for sagittal alignment. We enrolled 145 adolescents for FHP screening. The forward neck tilt angle (FNTA), defined as the angle between the vertical line and the line connecting the participant's acromion and tragus, was measured using the POM-Checker (a noninvasive depth sensor-based body angle measurement system). A whole-spine standing lateral radiograph was obtained, and eight sagittal alignment parameters were measured. Statistical analyses of the association between the FNTA and eight sagittal alignment parameters were conducted. We used 70% of the participant data to establish a preliminary diagnostic model for FHP based on FNTA and each sagittal alignment parameter. The accuracy of the model was evaluated using the remaining 30% of the participant data. All radiological parameters of sagittal alignment showed weak statistical significance with respect to FNTA (best case: r = 0.16, p = 0.0500; cranial tilt). The proposed preliminary diagnostic model for FHP demonstrated 95.35% agreement. Notably, the model using FNTA without radiological parameters accurately identified (100%) participants who required radiographic scanning for FHP diagnosis. Owing to the weak statistical significance of the association between radiological parameters and external body angle, both factors must be considered for accurate FHP diagnosis. When a clear and severe angle variation is observed in an external body angle check, medical professionals should perform radiographic scanning for an accurate FHP diagnosis. In conclusion, FNTA assessment of FNTA through the proposed preliminary diagnostic model is a significant screening factor for selecting participants who must undergo radiographic scanning so that a diagnosis of FHP can be obtained."

Second, we assessed the benefits of kinesiophobia, catastrophizing, mouth opening without pain, and forward head posture.\nMethods: Individuals with chronic TMDs were treated for five weeks. The intervention group (n = 17) underwent pain neuroscience education, manual therapy, and therapeutic exercise, whereas the control group (n = 17) underwent manual therapy only. Outcomes were evaluated immediately, at seven and 19 weeks follow-up. The assessment tools used were the Craniofacial Pain Disability Inventory, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Mandibular Range of Motion Scale, and Cervical Range of Motion Tool.\nResults: The interventions did not influence the differences in the improvements between the groups observed for craniofacial pain disability (inter-subject p 0.4). The intervention had a moderate influence on the improvement of kinesiophobia and catastrophizing (Inter-subject p 0.09 and 0.1 respectively) with a clinically significant effect size (Estimated mean (EM) -8.6 standard deviation (SD) ±3.48 p 0.019; and EM -7.6 SD ± 5.11 p 0.15 respectively).\nConclusion: The behavioral approach improved catastrophizing and kinesiophobia outcomes in individuals with chronic TMDs."

  "date": "2024 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Traditional testing prior to return to sport following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction typically involves jump-landing tasks in the forward direction. As injury is most likely the result of multiplanar neuromuscular control deficits, assessment of dynamic postural stability using landing tasks that require multiplanar stabilization may be more appropriate. The purpose of this study was to examine how dynamic postural stability is affected when performing jump-landing tasks in three different directions.\nMethods: Fifteen athletes [11 females (18.0 ± 3.0 years) and 4 males (18.5 ± 3.1 years)] following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed a series of single-limb jump-landing tasks in 3 directions. Individual directional stability indices and a composite dynamic postural stability index were calculated using ground reaction force data and were compared using separate one-way repeated measures ANOVAs.\nFindings: All directional stability indices demonstrated a significant main effect for jump-landing direction (medial-lateral P < 0.001, η2p = 0.95; anterior-posterior P < 0.001, η2p = 0.97; vertical P = 0.021, η2p = 0.24). The diagonal jump-landing direction produced increased medial-lateral stability and vertical stability scores, while the forward and diagonal jump-landing directions produced increased anterior-posterior stability scores. There was no significant effect for the composite dynamic stability index score.\nInterpretation: Jump-landing direction affects dynamic postural stability in all 3 planes of movement in athletes following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Results indicate the potential need to incorporate multiple jump-landing directions to better assess dynamic postural stability prior to return to sport."

  "abstract": "Objective: Unilateral mastectomy is known to induce postural alterations, yet the temporal development pattern of these changes remains elusive. This study aimed to explore the impact of unilateral mastectomy on body posture.\nMethods: A prospective, longitudinal, observational study with a one-group repeated-measures design was conducted. Patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy were recruited from a university-affiliated hospital in Western China and monitored for 12 months post-surgery. A trained nurse assessed seven postural baseline parameters on the day of suture removal and at 3, 6, and 12 months after unilateral mastectomy. Two parameters were in the sagittal plane (forward head posture and trunk rotation angle), and five were in the coronal plane (neck tilt, shoulder asymmetry, scapular asymmetry, scapular asymmetry relative to the spine, and pelvic tilt).\nResults: The final analysis included 159 patients. Baseline prevalence of most postural abnormalities ranged from 50.94% to 59.75%, with mean deviations between 2.74 and 4.51 mm. At 12 months post-mastectomy, prevalence and mean deviations increased by more than 30% and 3.50 mm, respectively, compared to baseline. Postural abnormalities increased gradually in the first 3 months, notably between the 3rd and 6th months, and slowed between the 6th and 12th months. On the mastectomy side, coronal plane abnormalities significantly increased within 12 months: earlobe to acromion distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P < 0.001), depressed shoulder height (Wald χ2 = 42.253, P < 0.001), depressed scapula height (Wald χ2 = 31.587, P < 0.001), scapula to spine distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P < 0.001), and elevated pelvic height (Wald χ2 = 48.924, P < 0.001).\nConclusions: Postural changes are common post-unilateral mastectomy, with prevalence and deviation increasing gradually, particularly between 3 and 6 months post-mastectomy. Early rehabilitation initiation is recommended to mitigate postural changes.\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2000040897."

In this study, we investigated the effect of elastic band exercises on the extent of athletes' forward head angle, kyphosis, rounded shoulder, and pain scores.\nMethods: Twenty-six male and female wheelchair athletes with spinal cord injuries (age: 27.11±6.67), active in table tennis, basketball and pétanque, were selected and randomly divided into either a control or training group. The Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI) questionnaire was used to investigate the level of shoulder pain. A sagittal view photogrammetry method was used to measure the forward head angle and round shoulder angle, and a flexible ruler was used to measure the thoracic kyphosis angle. For our statistical analysis, a covariance test (ANCOVA) and independent and dependent T tests were used.\nResults: After eight weeks of training, there was a significant decrease in the angle of the forward head tilt, kyphosis, round shoulder, and pain questionnaire scores in the training group (P<0.05).\nConclusions: Changes in the forward head angle, rounded shoulder and kyphosis angle, and pain scores show the desirable effect of resistance training with an elastic band. Therefore, this exercise program is recommended for wheelchair athletes with spinal cord injuries."

  "title": "The effect of various therapeutic exercises on forward head posture, rounded shoulder, and hyperkyphosis among people with upper crossed syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "date": "2024 Feb 1",
  "abstract": "Objectives: This review study aimed to evaluate the impact of therapeutic exercises on Upper-Crossed Syndrome (UCS). The study utilized a systematic review and meta-analysis approach to investigate the effects of various therapeutic exercises on forward head posture, rounded shoulders, and hyperkyphosis associated with upper crossed syndrome.\nMethods: The study identified relevant keywords for each independent and dependent variable and conducted a search in scientific databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, without any time limitations until 12 August 2023. Overall, 4625 articles were found in the selected databases, which were reduced to 1085 after being entered into the EndNote software and removing duplicate data. The full texts of 30 remaining studies were reviewed; ten articles meeting the criteria were included. Additionally, 12 studies from the Google Scholar database were included, resulting in 22 studies. Using Comprehensive meta-analysis software (CMA ver 3), data heterogeneity was measured with I2 and the Q tests. The Funnel Plot and Egger test methods were utilized to determine the possibility of publication bias. The JBI checklist was used to assess the quality of the studies.\nResults: The results of the meta-analysis showed that therapeutic exercises were effective in improving forward head, rounded shoulders, and thoracic kyphosis angles (CI 95% = -1.85-1.161, P = 0.001, P = 0.001, CI95%=-1.822-1.15, and P = 0.001, CI 95%= -1.83-1.09, respectively).\nConclusion: Based on the results, it appears that performing therapeutic exercises in the form of strength exercises, stretching, shoulder-based exercises, and incredibly comprehensive exercises that target all muscles may be effective in reducing forward head, rounded shoulders, thoracic kyphosis, and overall UCS."

  "title": "Predicting occupant head displacements in evasive maneuvers; tuning and comparison of a rotational based and a translational based neck muscle controller",
  "date": "2024 Jan 12",
  "abstract": "Objective: Real-life car crashes are often preceded by an evasive maneuver, which can alter the occupant posture and muscle state. To simulate the occupant response in such maneuvers, human body models (HBMs) with active muscles have been developed. The aim of this study was to implement an omni-directional rotational head-neck muscle controller in the SAFER HBM and compare the bio-fidelity of the HBM with a rotational controller to the HBM with a translational controller, in simulations of evasive maneuvers. Methods: The rotational controller was developed using an axis-angle representation of head rotations, with x, y, and z components in the axis. Muscle load sharing was based on rotational direction in the simulation and muscle activity recorded in three volunteer experiments in these directions. The gains of the rotational and translational controller were tuned to minimize differences between translational and rotational head displacements of the HBM and volunteers in braking and lane change maneuvers using multi-objective optimizations. Bio-fidelity of the model with tuned controllers was evaluated objectively using CORrelation and Analysis (CORA). Results: The results indicated comparable performance for both controllers after tuning, with somewhat higher bio-fidelity for rotational kinematics with the translational controller. After tuning, good or excellent bio-fidelity was indicated for both controllers in the loading direction (forward in braking, and lateral in lane change), with CORA scores of 0.86-0.99 and 0.93-0.98 for the rotational and translational controllers, respectively. For rotational displacements, and translational displacements in the other directions, bio-fidelity ranged from poor to excellent, with slightly higher average CORA scores for the HBM with the translational controller in both braking and lane changing. Time-averaged muscle activity was within one standard deviation of time-averaged muscle activity from volunteers. Conclusion: Overall, the results show that when tuned, both the translational and rotational controllers can be used to predict the occupant response to an evasive maneuver, allowing for the inclusion of evasive maneuvers prior to a crash in evaluation of vehicle safety. The rotational controller shows potential in controlling omni-directional head displacements, but the translational controller outperformed the rotational controller. Thus, for now, the recommendation is to use the translational controller with tuned gains."

  "title": "Influence of Spinal Sagittal Alignment in Sitting Posture on the Swallowing Speed of Older Adult Women: A Cross-Sectional Study",
  "date": "2024 Jan 27.",
  "abstract": "Thoracolumbar kyphosis in sitting posture is associated with forward head posture and may adversely affect swallowing function. However, few studies have investigated the effect of spinal alignment in the sitting posture on the swallowing function of older adults. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate whether spinal alignment in the sitting posture influences the swallowing function of older adult women. Overall, 18 older adult women (mean age, 69.78 ± 3.66 years) without dysphagia were enrolled. Participants were positioned in two sitting postures, namely, comfortable sitting (CS) and thoracic upright sitting (TUS). In each sitting posture, the kyphosis index (using a flexicurve), sagittal angles (head, cervical, shoulder, and pelvic angles; using a digital camera), and cervical range of motion (ROM) were evaluated. Swallowing speed (100-mL water swallowing test), maximum tongue pressure (MTP), and oral diadochokinesis (ODK) were also evaluated. Compared with TUS, CS showed a greater kyphosis index, anterior head translation, and posterior pelvic tilt. CS had greater flexion (p < 0.001) and less extension (p < 0.001) of cervical ROM than TUS. Swallowing speed was significantly decreased in CS compared with TUS (p = 0.008). MTP and ODK were not significantly different between CS and TUS. Thus, changes in sitting posture with spinal alignment may affect swallowing speed. Consequently, adjustments to reduce sitting postural kyphosis in older adult women may improve swallowing speed."

  "title": "Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis and Lumbar Disc Herniation",
  "date": "2023 Jun 27",
  "abstract": "Background: Unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) is a novel minimally invasive technique for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniations. Uniportal endoscopy was utilized prior to the advent of UBE and has been considered the workhorse of endoscopic spine surgery (ESS) for lumbar discectomy and decompressive laminectomy. However, there are theoretical advantages to UBE compared with traditional uniportal endoscopy, including that the procedure utilizes typical spinal equipment that should be readily available, requires less capital cost and optical instrumentation, and provides greater operative flexibility as a result of utilizing both a working and a viewing portal7,8.\nDescription: A 0-degree arthroscope is typically utilized for discectomy and lumbar laminectomies. The use of a radiofrequency ablator is critical to help coagulate osseous and muscle bleeders. For irrigation, gravity or a low-pressure pump, typically <40 mm Hg, can be utilized9,10. Further details regarding irrigation pressure are provided in \"Important Tips.\" The use of a standard powered burr is typical to help osseous decompression, and Kerrison ronguers, pituitaries, osteotomes, and probes utilized in open or tubular cases suffice. Two incisions are made approximately 1 cm lateral to the midline. If working from the left side for a right-handed surgeon, the working portal is typically made at the lower laminar margin of the target level. The camera portal is then made typically 2 to 3 cm cephalad. A lateral radiograph is then utilized to confirm the portal placements. From the right side, the working portal is cephalad and the camera portal is caudal. Because of the switch, the portals may be shifted more distally.The first step is creating a working space because there is no true joint space in the spine. With use of radiofrequency ablation, a working space is created in the interlaminar space. Next, with use of a powered burr or a chiseled osteotomy, the base of the cephalad spinous process is thinned until the insertion of the ligamentum flavum is found. Next, the ipsilateral and contralateral laminae are thinned in a similar fashion. Once the osseous elements are removed, the ligamentum flavum is removed en bloc. The traversing nerve roots are checked under direct high-magnification visualization to ensure that they are decompressed. If a discectomy is necessary, standard nerve-root retractors can be utilized to retract the neural elements. With use of a blunt-tip elevator, the anular defect can be incised and the herniated disc can be removed under direct high-power visualization. In addition, a small curet can be utilized to create a defect in the weakened anulus or membrane covering the extruded disc material in order to help deliver the herniated disc material. Epidural veins are coagulated typically with use of a fine-point bipolar radiofrequency device.\nAlternatives: Nonoperative treatments include oral anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and epidural injections; if these fail, alternative surgical treatments include open lumbar laminectomy and/or discectomy, tubular lumbar laminectomy and/or discectomy, and other minimally invasive techniques, such as microendoscopy, uniportal endoscopy, and microscopy-assisted decompression.\nRationale: UBE is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that better preserves osseous and muscular structure compared with open and tubular techniques. Conventional lumbar laminectomy involves dissection and retraction of the multifidus muscle from the spinous process to the facet joint. This exposure can damage the delicate posterior dorsal rami. Long retraction time can also lead to pressure-induced muscle atrophy and potentially increased chronic low back pain. Alternatively, smaller incisions and shorter hospital stays are possible with UBE.Similar to UBE, tubular surgery can minimize soft-tissue damage compared with open techniques; however, in a randomized trial assessing techniques for spinal stenosis surgery, Kang et al. found that UBE and tubular surgery had similarly favorable clinical outcomes at 6 months postoperatively but UBE resulted in decreased operative time, drain output, opiate use, and length of hospital stay5.Furthermore, the use of an endoscope in the biportal technique allows ultra-high magnification of the spinal pathology, decreased capital costs, and the ability to use 2 hands with freedom of movement. UBE provides clear visualization of the neural elements while keeping maximal ergonomic efficiency with the surgeon's head looking straight forward, the shoulders relaxed, and the elbows bent to 90°. Continuous irrigation through the endoscope also helps with bleeding and decreasing the risk of infection.\nExpected outcomes: Long-term outcomes do not differ substantially between discectomies performed with use of the presently described technique and procedures done with more traditional minimally invasive (i.e., tubular) techniques; however, visual analogue scale scores for back pain may be better in the short term, and there is evidence of a shorter hospital stay with UBE2. Complication rates did not differ from other minimally invasive techniques. When comparing UBE and stenosis, Aygun and Abdulshafi found that UBE was associated with decreased hospital stays, operative time, and blood loss and better clinical outcomes up to 2 years postoperatively compared with tubular laminectomy12.\nImportant tips: The optimal hydrostatic pressure is 30 to 50 mm Hg. Pressure is determined by the distance between the fluid source and the working space. Because the working space does not change, the height of the bag decides pressure. A simple formula for pressure is calculated by dividing the distance from the working field to the irrigation source by 1.36. A rule of thumb is that if the bag is 50 to 70 cm above the patient's back, the pressure should be adequate. The advantages of using gravity rather than a pressure pump are that excessive fluid solution pressure in the epidural space can cause neurological issues such as nuchal pain, headache, and seizure11. Additionally, if the intertransverse membrane or the lateral margins of the disc are violated, hydroperitoneum can occur unknowingly due to the high-pressure system.Gravity or pump pressure of >40 mm Hg may elevate epidural pressure and mask operative bleeding. When the pump is turned off at the end of the surgical procedure, a postoperative epidural hematoma may occur because the bleeding source may not have been recognized while the pump pressure was on.Excessive pump pressure may lead to an increase in intracranial pressure, causing headache or delayed recovery from general anesthesia with stiff posture and hyperventilation.Make sure fluid is emerging from the working portal and the muscle area is not swelling to prevent soft-tissue fluid extravasation.Epidural veins are coagulated typically with a fine-point bipolar radiofrequency device.Osseous bleeding can be controlled with bone wax or a high-speed burr.\nAcronyms and abbreviations: MRI = magnetic resonance imagingRF = radiofrequencyAP = anteroposterior."

  "date": "2024 Mar 1",
  "abstract": "Belt-positioning booster (BPB) seats may prevent submarining in reclined child occupants in frontal impacts. BPB-seated child volunteers showed reduced lateral displacement in reclined seating in low-acceleration lateral-oblique impacts. As submarining was particularly evident in reclined small adult female occupants, we examined if a booster seat could provide similar effects on the kinematics of the small female occupant to the ones found on the reclined child volunteers in low-acceleration far-side lateral oblique impacts. The THOR-AV-5F was seated on a vehicle seat on a sled simulating a far-side lateral-oblique impact (80 deg from frontal, maximum acceleration ∼2 g, duration ∼170 ms). Lateral and forward head and trunk displacements, trunk rotation, knee-head distance, seatbelt loads, and head acceleration were recorded. Three seatback angles (25 deg, 45 deg, 60 deg) and two booster conditions were examined. Lateral peak head and trunk displacements decreased in more severe reclined seatback angles (25-36 mm decrease compared to nominal). Forward peak head, trunk displacements, and knee-head distance were greater with the seatback reclined and no BPB. Knee-head distance increased in the severe reclined angle also with the booster seat (>40 mm compared to nominal). Seat belt peak loads increased with increased recline angle with the booster, but not without the booster seat. Booster-like solutions may be beneficial for reclined small female adult occupants to reduce head and trunk displacements in far-side lateral-oblique impacts, and knee-head distance and motion variability in severe reclined seatback angles."

  "title": "Āsana for Back, Hips and Legs to Prevent Musculoskeletal Disorders among Dental Professionals: In-Office Yóga Protocol",
  "date": "2023 Dec 22",
  "abstract": "Dental professionals are exposed to significant unavoidable physical stress, and theoretical ergonomic recommendations for a sitting workplace are inapplicable in many dental activities. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) represent a serious health problem among dental professionals (prevalence: 64-93%), showing involvement of 34-60% for the low back and 15-25% for the hips. Muscle stress; prolonged sitting; forward bending and twisting of the torso and head; unbalanced working postures with asymmetrical weight on the hips and uneven shoulders; and others are inevitable for dental professionals. Therefore, the approach for the prevention and treatment of WMSDs must be therapeutic and compensatory. This project was conceived to provide a Yoga protocol for dental professionals to prevent or treat WMSDs from a preventive medicine perspective, and it would represent a Yoga-based guideline for the self-cure and prevention of musculoskeletal problems.\nMethods: Specific Yoga positions (āsana, such as Virāsana, Virabhadrāsana, Garudāsana, Utkatāsana, Trikonāsana, Anuvittāsana, Chakrāsana, Uttanāsana, Pashimottanāsana) have been selected, elaborated on and adapted to be practiced in a dental office using a dental stool or the dental office walls or a dental unit chair. The protocol is specifically devised for dental professionals (dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants) and targeted for the low back, hips and legs (including knees and ankles). The protocol includes Visranta Karaka Sthiti (supported positions) in sitting (Upavistha Sthiti) and standing (Utthistha Sthiti) positions, twisting/torsions (Parivrtta), flexions/forward bend positions (Pashima) and extensions/arching (Purva) for musculo-articular system decompression and mobilization.\nResults: Over 60 Yogāsana-specifically ideated for back detensioning and mobilization, lumbar lordosis restoration, trunk side elongation, hip release and leg stretches and decontraction-are shown and described. The paper provides a meticulous description for each position, including the detailed movement, recommendations and mistakes to avoid, and the breathing pattern (breath control) in all the breath-driven movements (āsana in vinyāsa). An exhaustive analysis of posture-related disorders affecting the lower body among dental professionals is reported, including low-back pain, hip pain and disorders, piriformis syndrome and quadratus femoris dysfunction (gluteal pain), iliopsoas syndrome, multifidus disorders, femoroacetabular and ischiofemoral impingement, spinopelvic mobility, lumbopelvic rhythm, impairment syndromes, lower crossed syndrome, leg pain, knee pain and ankle disorders.\nConclusions: A detailed guideline of āsana for low-back decompression, hip joint destress, piriformis and gluteal muscle release, lumbar lordosis recovery and a spinopelvic mobility increase has been elaborated on. The designed Yogāsana protocol represents a powerful tool for dental professionals to provide relief to retracted stiff muscles and unbalanced musculoskeletal structures in the lower body."

  "date": "2024 Apr",
  "abstract": "Background: The cervical vertebrae and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may be linked through their common muscles.\nObjectives: The aim of the present study was to compare the linear intra-articular motions of the TMJ between individuals with the normal craniocervical posture (CCP) and severe forward head posture (FHP).\nDesign: Cross-sectional study.\nMethods: Volunteers (N = 38) were equally assigned to either the severe FHP group or the normal CCP group according to their craniovertebral angle (CVA). The CVA angles greater than 49° were considered as the normal CCP while angles between 44 and 40° were regarded as the severe FHP. The TMJ was imaged at the closed, median, and maximum open positions of the mouth using an ultrasound machine with a 7.5 MHz linear transducer in the sitting position. The best-fitting curve in the contour registration method was employed to measure displacement of the mandibular condyle on the transverse and vertical axes.\nResults: The forward displacement of the mandibular condyle in the severe FHP group was significantly (p-value = 0.037) reduced compared to the normal CCP group at maximum open position of the mouth, while no significant difference was revealed at closed (p-value = 0.937) or median open (p-value = 0.699) positions. The perpendicular displacement of the mandibular condyle exhibited no significant (p-value>0.107) difference between groups at any mouth position.\nDiscussion: The current study demonstrated, for the first time, that severe FHP may impact the intra-articular motion of the TMJ. This study presumed that individuals with severe FHP may encounter a force imbalance in the anterior-posterior direction."

  "abstract": "We previously reported that laryngeal widening led to improved exercise tolerance in COPD. However, it is not clear whether laryngeal narrowing occurs as a compensatory response to tracheal movement or is affected by posture. Here, we report the case of an advanced COPD patient whose more prolonged expiration in a head-forward leaning position compared with that in a neck-extended position occurred with an excessive duration of severe laryngeal narrowing without tracheal obstruction, which led to exercise intolerance with expiratory mechanical constraints. This case provided useful insights into the regulation of the upper airway with body positioning for improving exercise tolerance."

  "date": "2024 Mar 1",
  "abstract": "The active control of the lumbar musculature provides a stable platform critical for postures and goal-directed movements. Voluntary and perturbation-evoked motor commands can recruit individual lumbar muscles in a task-specific manner according to their presumed biomechanics. Here, we investigated the vestibular control of the deep and superficial lumbar musculature. Ten healthy participants were exposed to noisy electrical vestibular stimulation while balancing upright with their head facing forward, left, or right to characterize the differential modulation in the vestibular-evoked lumbar extensor responses in generating multidirectional whole body motion. We quantified the activation of the lumbar muscles on the right side using indwelling [deep multifidus, superficial multifidus, caudal longissimus (L4), and cranial longissimus (L1)] and high-density surface recordings. We characterized the vestibular-evoked responses using coherence and peak-to-peak cross-covariance amplitude between the vestibular and electromyographic signals. Participants exhibited responses in all lumbar muscles. The vestibular control of the lumbar musculature exhibited muscle-specific modulations: responses were larger in the longissimus (combined cranio-caudal) compared with the multifidus (combined deep-superficial) when participants faced forward (P < 0.001) and right (P = 0.011) but not when they faced left. The high-density surface recordings partly supported this observation: the location of the responses was more lateral when facing right compared with left (P < 0.001). The vestibular control of muscle subregions within the longissimus or the multifidus was similar. Our results demonstrate muscle-specific vestibular control of the lumbar muscles in response to perturbations of vestibular origin. The lack of differential activation of lumbar muscle subregions suggests the vestibular control of these subregions is co-regulated for standing balance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated the vestibular control of the deep and superficial lumbar extensor muscles using electrical vestibular stimuli. Vestibular stimuli elicited preferential activation of the longissimus muscle over the multifidus muscle. We did not observe clear regional activation of lumbar muscle subregions in response to the vestibular stimuli. Our findings show that the central nervous system can finely tune the vestibular control of individual lumbar muscles and suggest minimal regional variations in the activation of lumbar muscle subregions."

Participants were randomly assigned to the stabilization exercise with visual feedback (SE-VF) group (N = 15) or stabilization exercise group (N = 15). The SE-VF group performed cervical stabilization exercise while sitting on a chair without a backrest and checking their side profile in real-time via a monitor 3-m away. The stabilization exercise group performed the same cervical stabilization exercise as the SE-VF group but without visual feedback. Craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured to quantify forward head posture, and the proprioception of the subjects was evaluated.\nResults: There was a significant interaction between group and time in CVA and proprioception (P < .05). Additionally, there was no significant difference pre-intervention between the groups (P > .05); however, there was a significant difference post-intervention (P < .05) in CVA and proprioception.\nConclusion: The findings of this study showed that the cervical stabilization exercise with visual feedback was effective for the proprioception of subjects.

  "date": "2024 Apr",
  "abstract": "Stroke is a significant health problem that may result in long-term functional deficits. Balance and walking problems are among the most common post-stroke deficits, and they may negatively affect quality of life. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of cervical mobilization on balance and gait parameters after stroke. Participants were 24 adults (aged 30-65 years), who scored 24 or above on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and no more than 3 on the Modified Rankin scale. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental Bobath therapy and cervical mobilization group (n = 12) or a control group who received Bobath therapy and a sham application (n = 12). Both groups received 60 minutes of Bobath therapy three times a week for four weeks; additionally, the experimental group received 15 minutes of cervical mobilization in each session, while the control group received 15 minutes of spinal sham mobilization each session. Pre and post treatment, we assessed all participants' demographic characteristics, gait parameters, balance parameters, and forward head posture values using a clinical data assessment form, spatiotemporal gait analysis (LEGSystm), portable computerized kinesthetic balance device (SportKAT 550), and craniovertebral angle (CVA), respectively. The groups showed no significant differences in their initial demographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, stroke duration and disability levels.). In comparing changes on variables of interest, we observed significant experimental versus control group improvements in balance parameters except for their left side balance score (right side, left side, forward, backward and total balance scores were significant at p = .003, p = .089, p < .001, p = .022, p < .001, respectively), gait parameters (stride number, stride length, stride time, stride velocity, cadance at p = .007, p = .019, p = .013, p = .005, p = .001, respectively) and CVA (p < .001). Also, there were findings in favor of the experimental group on the modified timed up and go test on walk out, mid turn, walk back and total times (p = .028, p = .001, p = .016, and p = .001, respectively),but not for sit-to-stand time or stand-to-sit time. Clinicians involved in stroke rehabilitation should assess and treat the cervical region to enhance rehabilitation effectiveness."

Abnormal cranio-cervical posture has been linked to various types of headaches. However, the correlation between MTrPs sensitivity, cervical postural alignment, and clinical measures of headache has not been extensively studied in patients with TTH.\nObjectives: To investigate the relationship between MTrPs sensitivity in cervical and pericranial muscles, cervical postural abnormality, and clinical headache parameters in patients with TTH. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of sex on the examined variables and their association with headache type (episodic vs chronic TTH).\nMethods: A total of 72 patients with TTH of both sexes were enrolled in this study. Headache frequency and disability as clinical measures of headache, pressure pain threshold (PPT) of bilateral upper trapezius (UT) and suboccipital (SUB) muscles, cervical lordosis angle (CA), and anterior head translation (AHT) were measured.\nResults: Pericranial MTrPs sensitivity did not demonstrate any correlation with clinical headache parameters or cervical postural abnormality. However, there was a significant correlation between the frequency of headaches and the level of disability (r = 0.32, P < 0.05). In addition, episodic TTH was more prevalent in females who exhibited greater AHT and MTrPs sensitivity of both bilateral UT and right SUB muscles than males.\nConclusions: There was no correlation found between the frequency of headaches and the level of disability with measures of cervical posture alignment or MTrPs sensitivity in individuals with TTH.. Based on findings, Clinicians should consider sex differences when assessing patients with TTH."

Surface electromyography (EMG) was performed to record muscle activity in the thoracic erector spinae (TES), sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), and cervical erector spinae (CES).\nResults: The DTWE group showed significant increases in the craniovertebral angle (CVA) and TES EMG activity and significant decreases in the thoracic kyphosis angle and SCM and CES EMG activity compared with those shown by the STWE group following the intervention (p< 0.05). However, lumbar lordosis or pelvic tilt angles did not differ significantly between the groups after the intervention (p> 0.05).\nConclusions: DTWE can be effective in reducing thoracic kyphosis and FHP without causing compensatory movements of the lumbar spine and pelvis."

  "date": "2023 Dec",
  "abstract": "[Purpose] To present the dramatic improvement in posture, radiographic parameters and the alleviation of neck and severe shoulder pain related to shoulder injury associated with vaccine administration (SIRVA) after a COVID-19 injection with a shoulder mobility and posture rehabilitation program. [Participant and Methods] A middle-aged male presented complaining of severe left shoulder pain evolving since receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. The pain was severe and throbbed into the neck. Posture analysis showed a chronic stooped posture with forward head posture and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Treatment included 42 sessions of Chiropractic Biophysics® technique and a shoulder rehabilitation program using three-dimensional vibration. [Results] At 4-months, the patient reported no neck or shoulder pain. There was a 60% decrease in neck disability. The forward head decreased 34 mm, thoracic hyperkyphosis decreased 13°, and T1-T12 forward lean decreased 73 mm, among other radiographic parameters. Re-assessment after 26-months showed maintenance of the treatment induced posture/x-ray corrections and shoulder pain relief. [Conclusion] This case demonstrates immediate and long-term improvement in a patient suffering from COVID-19 vaccine SIRVA, concomitant with neck pain and disability as well as significant radiographic postural/spinal deformity. These conditions all improved and were maintained at a 2 year follow-up without further treatment."

  "title": "Improvement of Groin Pain in a Football Player with Femoroacetabular Impingement via a Correction of the Pelvic Position-A Case Report",
  "date": "2023 Nov 30",
  "abstract": "Background: Femoroacetabular impingement is one possible cause for groin pain and can lead to long periods of absence for football players. In cam impingement, the end-grade position of the leg at kicking makes the hip particularly prone to faulty contact between the acetabulum and the femoral head. Studies suggest that the resting position of the pelvis in the sagittal plane may have an important role in the biomechanics of movement in the presence of cam impingement. Methods: A 19-year-old male competitive footballer complained of sudden groin pain during a period of low athletic load. Biomechanical tests (3D posture and isometric strength analyses) showed that unbalanced individual strength training had resulted in an increased forward tilt of the pelvis. At the same time, cam impingement was confirmed radiologically, which obviously contributed to the sudden onset of the symptoms. The kicking technique of the athlete showed increased hip and trunk flexion, which also indicated a muscular imbalance. Targeted strength and stretching exercises three times a week improved the pelvic position in terms of reduced anteversion. At the same time, the patient performed strength exercises to improve his kicking technique. Results: After 8 weeks, improvements in his pelvic position and global posture and increased muscle strength could be verified. At the same time, the athlete was free of complaints again. Conclusions: When groin pain occurs in football players with cam impingement, special attention should be paid to the resting position of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. Correcting increased pelvic anteversion can prevent unfavourable end-grade collisions of the acetabulum and femoral head during kicking with strong hip flexion and adduction. Possible changes in the pelvic position due to adverse individual strength training performed by young athletes should always be kept in mind."

  "abstract": "Introduction: Motion in the spine, pelvis and hips which make up the spinopelvic femoral complex (SPFC) implies mechanical relationships that help maintain trunk balance and optimize hip functionThe aim of this study was to understand the physiology of the SPFC and evaluate the dysfunctions of the SPFC and their implications for total hip arthroplasty considering the hip-spine relationship.\nMethods: A review of relevant and comprehensive studies on this subject is reported in order to highlight a pathophysiology that integrates the description of the evaluations of the spine-pelvic and hip parameters and recommendations for the kinematic planning of the THA procedure. The primary objective was to determine which type of hip-spine relationship has the highest risk for THA complications and to become proficient in selecting the priority surgical intervention when both the hip and spine are affected. Finally, this review attempted to assist hip surgeons with surgical technique, tools, implant selection, and goals of planning a THA that requires personalized kinematic alignment. Determine the influence of THA on these kinematics and the effect of stiffness of the lumbopelvic complex on the risk of THA failure.\nResults: When a person sits, the pelvis goes into retroversion and the acetabulum opens forward. This frees the femoral head and neck to allow hip flexion. The opposite - pelvic anteversion - occurs when a person stands. When pelvic mobility is limited, the hip must increase its range of motion to accommodate these posture changes. Disturbances in spinal and pelvic kinematics lead to abnormal hip function, which may contribute to complications following total hip arthroplasty (THA).\nConclusion: A precise evaluation of the parameters governing the SPFC must be taken into account in order to best optimize the placement and choice of THA implants.\nLevel of evidence: IV."

  "abstract": "Background: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the forward head posture (FHP), thoracic kyphosis and their relationships between individuals with migraine and healthy controls using the DIERS Formetric 4D motion imaging system.\nMethods: In this observational case-control study, a total of 39 migraine patients and 44 healthy subjects were enrolled. FHP and thoracic kyphosis were assessed by using the 4D Formetric DIERS system. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and Neck Disability Index (NDI) was used to evaluate neck pain and neck disability. Headache status were evaluated through Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) questionnaires.\nResults: The fleche cervicale (57.72 ± 13.72 mm vs. 40.00 ± 4.75 mm; p < 0.001) and kyphotic angle (57.39 ± 8.76° vs. 38.21 ± 5.67°; p < 0.001) were significantly higher in patients with migraine compared to control group. When NDI categories were compared, the migraine group showed significantly increase in the number of patients with moderate or severe disability (p < 0.001). A positive correlation was found between fleche cervicale and thoracic kyphosis (r = 0.71, p < 0.001).\nConclusions: This study revealed that patients with migraine exhibited a greater FHP and thoracic kyphosis compared to the control group. A 3-dimensional objective measurement may be a reliable diagnostic tool to evaluate posture analysis in clinical practice in the future."

  "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate the effects of Cervical Stabilization Training (CST) on the headache, neck pain and cervical musculoskeletal system in patients with headache compared to the control group.\nMethods: A total of 90 female patients with migraine, tension-type headache and cervicogenic headache (CGH) participated in this study. The patients were divided into the cervical stabilization training group (CSTG) and the control group (CG). The CSTG performed the CST three times a week for 8 weeks while the CG continued their ongoing medical treatment. The pain intensity was assessed by Visual Analogue Scale, forward head posture by craniovertebral angle measurement, the endurance of deep cervical flexor muscles by craniocervical flexion test and the endurance of cervical muscles by flexor and extensor endurance tests before and after 8 weeks. In addition, disability levels, health-related quality of life, sleep quality and mood were assessed by the Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Short Form 36 Quality of Life Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Beck Depression Scale, respectively.\nResults: Headache frequency, duration and intensity, neck pain intensity and forward head posture reduced while activation and performance of deep cervical flexor muscles, the endurance of cervical flexor and extensor muscles increased in the CSTG (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the disability levels, quality of life, sleep quality and mood also improved in the CSTG (p < 0.05).\nConclusions: This study suggests that CST reduces headaches and neck pain by improving the cervical musculoskeletal system in patients with headache.\nSignificance: The CST improved the headache frequency, duration and intensity, neck pain intensity, cervical posture, activation of deep cervical flexor muscles and endurance of cervical muscles in patients with headache. In addition, improvements in the cervical musculoskeletal system contributed to a reduction in the intensity of headaches and neck pain. Therefore, CST may be preferred in the treatment of headaches, especially with coexisting neck pain."

  "abstract": "Study design: Cross-sectional analytical study.\nIntroduction: Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is a long-standing condition with varying extents of disability seen among patients. The role of postural manifestations and contractile tissue involvement in this condition is poorly understood and yet to be explored.\nPurpose: This study aimed to analyze if individuals with adhesive capsulitis demonstrated the characteristics of an upper crossed syndrome (UCS) postural manifestation and whether or not its presence affected the extent of disability experienced by this population.\nMethods: Sixty-five individuals with AC were assessed for the presence of UCS. Scapular muscle strength and length alterations, forward head posture (FHP), and disability were assessed and compared between those with and without UCS. Paired T test and an independent T test were utilized to compare means within and between these groups, respectively, while non-parametric measures were utilized for their skewed counterparts. Phi coefficient (φ) was used to determine the strength of association between the descriptive patient characteristics. The correlation between symptom duration and degree of postural involvement was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.\nResults: 43.1% of the study population demonstrated UCS and 80% FHP with a significant negative correlation between Cranio Vertebral Angle and chronicity of AC (r = -0.27). Individuals with AC demonstrated significantly decreased scapular muscle strength (p = <.001) and pectoralis minor length on the affected side (p = .03). No differences were seen between groups with and without UCS. The mean SPADI scores between groups demonstrated a more significant level of perceived pain and disability in individuals with UCS (p = .049).\nConclusions: As seen in UCS, individuals with AC demonstrated alterations in movement patterns and posture. UCS was seen to contribute towards the existing disability in AC. This study suggests a careful evaluation and intervention based on these findings to document its effect on pain and dysfunction in AC."

  "date": "2024 Jan",
  "abstract": "Introduction: This study aims to investigate the pattern of intraocular pressure (IOP) changes in different postures among patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG).\nMethods: A observational study was conducted on a total of 74 patients with OAG (148 eyes). IOP measurements were taken in a variety of positions, including supine, left lateral decubitus, right lateral decubitus, head tilted downwards position with immediate head-up (transient head tilted downwards), seated, seated with head tilted downwards, standing, and walking. Each position was held for 5 min before measurement. In all positions, the patient maintains both eyes looking forward and remains alert. In the head tilted downwards position, the angle of head tilt with respect to the sagittal plane was 30°.\nResults: The overall trend of IOP changes showed a significant decrease with an increase in the position height (r = 0.037, p < 0.001). The IOP was significantly higher in the supine, left lateral decubitus, right lateral decubitus, and head tilted downwards positions than in the seated position (p < 0.001). Compared with the seated position with eyes at primary gaze, IOP decreased significantly when standing (p = 0.008) or walking (p < 0.001). The IOP in the left lateral decubitus and right lateral decubitus was significantly higher than in the supine position (p = 0.008, p = 0.001, respectively). The IOP decreased significantly during walking compared with standing (p < 0.001).\nConclusions: The magnitude of IOP strongly correlates with the body position during IOP measurement. The head tilted downwards, supine, left lateral decubitus, and right lateral decubitus positions result in a higher IOP than IOP at the seated position. Patients with OAG can potentially reduce IOP fluctuations by adjusting their daily postures."

Sonography images and a universal goniometer (UG) were used to assess elastic modulus and cervical ROM, respectively. In addition, FHP was assessed based on measuring craniovertebral angle (CVA) using a digital imaging technique and also the distance of anterior tragus of the ear with the vertical line passed from anterior of lateral malleolus according to the Kendall and McCreary method.\nResults: Elastic modulus of suboccipital muscles in the CGH group was significantly higher than that of the normal group (P=0.008). The two groups were not significantly different in terms of FHP. Moreover, ROM of cervical extension (P=0.035), right rotation (P=0.046), and left rotation (P=0.018) showed a significant reduction in the CGH group compared to the control group.\nConclusion: Suboccipital muscles are stiffer and ROM of cervical rotation and extension is smaller in CGH patients than the healthy controls, but FHP is not different between the groups, leading to diagnosing CGH and treatment."

  "date": "2023 Sep 18",
  "abstract": "Upper cross syndrome is a postural dysfunction that can cause a variety of upper-body musculoskeletal problems. Early detection and physiotherapy can help to prevent further complications. However, no systematic review has evaluated the effect of various physiotherapy intervention strategies to treat this syndrome. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a detailed methodological literature search of the most effective treatment strategies available for the correction of upper cross syndrome. Prospective human subject studies published in the English language that report the assessment and rehabilitation of upper cross syndrome were included. Clinical trials (randomized and non-randomized) were included when compared to a comparator, control group, and no treatment. The search was limited to human subjects and English-language articles. Outcome measures included craniovertebral angle, kyphotic angle, rounded shoulder, neck or shoulder pain, neck range of motion, electromyographic activity of neck or scapular muscles, and functional limitations. To evaluate the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials, the Cochrane collaboration tool was employed. For non-randomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Intervention was used. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to rate the effectiveness of the evidence. A random-effect meta-analysis was performed for quantitative analysis to report significant differences based on calculated mean differences, with matching 95% confidence intervals (CIs) whenever possible. Out of the 34 potentially relevant articles, 18 were included. The postural variables including craniovertebral angle, kyphotic angle, and rounded shoulder showed a significant improvement with the physiotherapy group compared to the no-treatment group (standardized mean difference = -1.78; 95% CI = -2.68 to -0.87; p = 0.0001). Secondary outcomes such as pain and functional limitation showed a significant difference when advanced manual therapy techniques were used compared to conventional therapy (standardized mean difference = -0.71; 95% CI = -1.04 to -0.39; p< 0.0001; and standardized mean difference = -0.57; 95% CI = -1.00 to -0.14; p = 0.009, respectively). Exercise therapy was found to be beneficial in correcting postural alignment and movement patterns, while manual therapy was found to be similarly effective in pain reduction and functional improvement."

Therefore, as an outcome measure for therapeutic intervention, measuring the craniovertebral angle with the Surgimap smartphone app is a cost-effective, easily accessible, and reliable tool. This study's objective was to assess the clinimetric properties of the Surgimap smartphone application with Surgimap system software to measure the Craniovertebral Angle in different age groups and positions.\nMethod: Ninety subjects with neck pain were randomly allocated to aged between 18 and 30 years (Group A; n = 45) and 45-60 years (Group B; n = 45). Using the Surgimap smartphone application and Surgimap system software, the craniovertebral angle was measured objectively in the sagittal plane. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to determine validity and reliability. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curves (AUC) were determined to distinguish participants with and without forward head posture.\nResult: The result of this study shows that Smartphone Surgimap Application and Surgimap System Software correlate 0.95 and have p-values of 0.01 for diverse positions and ages. CVA measurement in the sitting position was significantly lower than in the standing position, regardless of methodology or age. Both positions demonstrated high intra-rater reliability, as evidenced by Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) between 0.972 and 0.991. The minimum detectable change (MDC) values ranged from 1.3 to 1.733, indicating high measurement accuracy. The smartphone application demonstrated outstanding diagnostic sensitivity (100.00% for Group A standing) and specificity (93.55% for Group B standing).\nConclusion: The Surgimap smartphone application is a reliable and accurate method for craniovertebral angle measurement and is useful for measuring outcomes. Also standing posture was found to be better than sitting posture while measuring the CVA."

  "title": "A Multidisciplinary Approach to Swallowing Rehabilitation in Patients with Forward Head Posture",
  "date": "2023 Aug 31",
  "abstract": "(1) Background and Objectives: The forward head posture (FHP) is characterized by increased extensions of upper cervical vertebrae and flexion of the lower cervical vertebrae and upper thoracic regions, associated with muscle shortening. The compressive loading on the tissues in the cervical spine negatively impacts suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles and generates increased tension of the masticatory muscles. The tongue has relations with the suprahyoid and the infrahyoid muscles. The pattern of swallowing evolves gradually from birth to the age of four. If this developmental transition does not occur, the result is persistent infantile or atypical swallowing-an orofacial myofunctional disorder with the tongue in improper position during swallowing, causing strain and stress on the jaw, face, head and neck. In FHP, muscles crucial to swallowing are biomechanically misaligned. The lengthening of the suprahyoid muscles necessitates stronger contractions to achieve proper hyolaryngeal movement during swallowing. This study assesses the added benefits of physiotherapy to the traditional myofunctional swallowing rehabilitation for patients with FHP. The underlying hypothesis is that without addressing FHP, swallowing rehabilitation remains challenged and potentially incomplete. (2) Materials and Methods: A total of 61 participants (12-26 years) meeting the inclusion criteria (FHP and atypical swallowing) were divided into two similar groups. Group A attended one orofacial myofunctional therapy (OMT) and one physiotherapy session per week, group B only one OMT session per week, for 20 weeks. Exclusion criteria were as follows: ankyloglossia, neurological impairment affecting tongue and swallowing, cervical osteoarticular pathology, other previous or ongoing treatments for FHP and atypical swallowing. (3) Results: There is a significant improvement in terms of movement and use of the orofacial structures (tongue, lips, cheeks), as well as in breathing and swallowing in both groups. Group A achieved better outcomes as the CVA angle was directly addressed by manual therapy and GPR techniques. (4) Conclusions: The combined therapy proved to be more effective than single OMT therapy."

  "title": "The Correlation between Neck Pain and Disability, Forward Head Posture, and Hyperkyphosis with Opium Smoking: A Cross-Sectional Study from Iran",
  "date": "2023 Sep 3",
  "abstract": "Opium smoking has been a common practice in Iran for many years, with people often smoking for long hours. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in opium smoking due to false beliefs about its protective effects against COVID-19 infection. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between the non-ergonomic positions associated with traditional opium smoking in Iran and the development of neck pain and disability, forward head posture (FHP), and hyperkyphosis (HK). In this cross-sectional, correlational study, a total of 120 individuals who smoked opium were selected based on the inclusion criteria. They were interviewed about their addiction profile using the Lite version of the Addiction Severity Index and the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire. The presence of neck pain and disability was also evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale and the Neck Disability Index. The participants were examined for FHP via side-view photography and for HK using a flexible ruler. Data were analyzed using correlation coefficient tests and stepwise linear regression analysis. Based on the results, homelessness, the lifetime duration of opium smoking (in months), the duration of daily opium smoking (in minutes), and the severity of drug dependence had significant relationships with the severity of neck pain, neck disability, FHP, and HK. Homelessness was the strongest predictor of neck pain and disability (R2 = 0.367, p < 0.001), FHP (R2 = 0.457, p < 0.001), and HK (R2 = 0.476, p < 0.001), followed by the lifetime duration of opium smoking and the duration of daily opium smoking, respectively, in which R2 increased to 0.505 (p = 0.011), 0.546 (p = 0.022), and 0.570 (p = 0.004) with the addition of two other variables. Overall, an increase in the duration of sitting in non-ergonomic positions could lead to neck pain and disability, FHP, and HK due to the non-neutral posture of opium smokers."

  "date": "2023 Dec",
  "abstract": "Vehicle occupants expect greater postural flexibility with the introduction of highly automated vehicles, such as reclined postures. Experiments have been conducted with post mortem human subjects to study the risk of injury under impact conditions in reclined postures. However, the influence of the pre-crash phase on the kinematics in reclined postures has not yet been thoroughly studied. The aim of the present study is to investigate human responses under low g braking conditions focusing on different backrest angles in a generic sled environment. Three 50th percentile male volunteers were recruited to participate in a sled experiment. Each of them was subjected to a total of fourteen trials under a braking pulse with a maximum acceleration of 0.7 g for 700 ms. Different sitting postures were investigated: from 23° to 45°, 60° and 75° backrest tilt with respect to the vertical axis. In addition, two different seat pan tilt angles were considered: a 16° tilt angle for 23°, 45° and 60° backrest inclination and a 36° tilt angle for 60° and 75° backrest inclination. Measurements of volunteer kinematics, muscle activation and interaction forces between the volunteers and the sled, among others, were acquired. Initial results show a significant reduction in maximum forward head displacement from the upright to the reclined postures (p < 0.02), with the exception of the 45° reclined posture. However, no significant difference in maximum head displacement was found between the different reclined postures (p > 0.1). Seat pan tilt angle did significantly influence forward head excursion when considering the same seatback inclination (p < 0.01). It is of great importance to investigate occupant kinematics during the pre-crash phase to understand its influence on the potential injuries that may occur with a reclined posture in the event of a collision."

  "title": "Head-torso coordination in police officers wearing loaded tactical vests during running",
  "date": "2024 Jan",
  "abstract": "Background: The influence of load carriage in operational police officers is not well understood despite a relatively high injury rate. Assessing load related changes in head and torso coordination may provide valuable insight into plausible injury mechanisms.\nResearch question: Do typical police tactical vest loads alter head and torso coordination during running?\nMethods: Thirty-eight UK police officers ran at a self-selected pace (>2 ms-1) on a non-motorised treadmill in four vest load conditions (unloaded, and low, high and evenly distributed loads). Peak head and torso tilt, and peak vest displacement were compared between all four conditions. Timings between vest and torso change of direction were compared between the three loaded conditions. The coupling angle between the head and torso calculated using modified vector coding were compared between unloaded and each loaded conditions using Statistical Parametric Mapping.\nResults: No significant differences were found between conditions for peak head or torso tilt alone (p > 0.05). Loading equipment low on the vest led to significantly greater mediolateral vest displacements (38 mm) away from the torso than a high (34 mm) or evenly distributed (30 mm) conditions. The vest was found to change direction vertically before the torso in the anterior-posterior direction, and then influence torso motion. The loaded conditions changed the head-torso coupling from in-phase (with head-dominancy) to anti-phase (with torso dominancy) between 55% and 77% stance. Anti-phase with a relatively stationary head and the torso rotating forward likely places a greater concentric demand on the posterior neck muscles relative to unloaded running.\nSignificance: Current tactical vest designs allow significant extra displacement of load away from the body during running, altering coordination at the head and torso."

  "title": "Regional brain strain dependance on direction of head rotation",
  "date": "2023 Dec",
  "abstract": "Brain injuries in automated vehicles during crash events are likely to include mechanisms of head impact in non-standard positions and postures (i.e., occupants not facing forward in an upright position). Federal regulations currently focus on impact conditions in primary planes of motion, such as frontal or rear impacts (sagittal plane of motion) or side impact (coronal plane of motion) and do not account for out of position occupants or non-standard postures. The objective of the present study was to develop and use the anatomically accurate brain finite element model to parametrically determine the injury metrics under different vectors with head rotation. A custom developed brain finite element model with anatomical accuracy and several anatomical regions defined was used to evaluate whole-brain strain as well as regional brain strain. Cumulative Strain Damage Measure (CSDM) at a threshold of 20% strain and the 95th percentile of the maximum principal strain (MPS95) were calculated for the whole brain and each brain region under multiple rotational directions. The model was exposed to a sinusoidal angular acceleration pulse of 5000 rad per second squared (rad/s2-) over 12.5 ms. The same pulse was used in the primary axes of motion and (lateral bending, flexion, extension, axial rotation) and combined axes representing oblique flexion and oblique extension. Whole brain CSDM20 was highest for lateral bending. Whole brain MPS95 was highest for axial rotation. The rCSDM20 was more susceptible to impact direction, with several brain regions having substantial accumulation of strain for oblique flexion and lateral bending. Comparatively, rMPS95 was more consistent across all rotation directions. The present study quantified the regional brain strain response under multiple rotational vectors identifying a high amount of variability in the accumulation of strain (i.e., CSDM20) in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and midbrain specifically. While there was a high amount of variability in the accumulation of strain for multiple regions, the maximum strain measured (i.e., MPS95) in the regions was more consistent."

  "title": "Mesoporous Nano-Badminton with Asymmetric Mass Distribution: How Nanoscale Architecture Affects the Blood Flow Dynamics",
  "date": "2023 Oct 4",
  "abstract": "While the nanobio interaction is crucial in determining nanoparticles' in vivo fate, a previous work on investigating nanoparticles' interaction with biological barriers is mainly carried out in a static state. Nanoparticles' fluid dynamics that share non-negligible impacts on their frequency of encountering biological hosts, however, is seldom given attention. Herein, inspired by badmintons' unique aerodynamics, badminton architecture Fe3O4&mPDA (Fe3O4 = magnetite nanoparticle and mPDA = mesoporous polydopamine) Janus nanoparticles have successfully been synthesized based on a steric-induced anisotropic assembly strategy. Due to the \"head\" Fe3O4 having much larger density than the mPDA \"cone\", it shows an asymmetric mass distribution, analogous to real badminton. Computational simulations show that nanobadmintons have a stable fluid posture of mPDA cone facing forward, which is opposite to that for the real badminton. The force analysis demonstrates that the badminton-like morphology and mass distribution endow the nanoparticles with a balanced motion around this posture, making its movement in fluid stable. Compared to conventional spherical Fe3O4@mPDA nanoparticles, the Janus nanoparticles with an asymmetric mass distribution have straighter blood flow trails and ∼50% reduced blood vessel wall encountering frequency, thus providing doubled blood half-life and ∼15% lower organ uptakes. This work provides novel methodology for the fabrication of unique nanomaterials, and the correlations between nanoparticle architectures, biofluid dynamics, organ uptake, and blood circulation time are successfully established, providing essential guidance for designing future nanocarriers."

  "date": "2023 Nov",
  "abstract": "Objective: Pediatric anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) are important tools for the assessment of child occupant protection and should represent realistic child belt fit and posture on belt-positioning boosters. Previous comparisons have been made to children in either self-selected or nominal postural conditions. This study compares belt fit and postural measurements between pediatric ATDs and a single cohort of children assuming different postures on boosters: self-selected, holding a portable electronic device, and nominal.\nMethods: A cohort of children (n = 25) were evaluated in a stationary vehicle on five boosters and in three postural conditions: nominal, self-selected, and a representative holding electronic device position. The Hybrid III 6- and 10-year-old and Q-Series 6- and 10-year-old ATDs were evaluated in the same five boosters and in two postural conditions: nominal and a representative holding electronic device position. A 3D coordinate measurement device was used to quantify belt fit (shoulder belt score, lap belt score, maximum gap size, and gap length) and anatomic landmark positions (head, suprasternale, ASIS, and patella). Landmark positions and belt fit were compared between ATDs and children for each booster and postural condition, and Pearson correlations (r) were assessed across boosters.\nResults: ATDs generally represented Nominal child postures across boosters. In the Device condition, ATDs were seldom able to be positioned to represent both the torso and head position of children, due to limited ATD spinal flexibility. When the torso position was matched, the ATD head was more rear by 63 mm. Correlations between Nominal child and ATD belt fit and belt gap metrics were generally weak and not significant, with the exception of lap belt score (all ATDs p < 0.07, r = 0.8549-0.9857).\nDiscussion: ATDs were generally able to represent realistic child postures and lap belt fit in Nominal and short duration Self-selected postures in a laboratory setting. However, these results display the potential difficulty of utilizing ATDs to represent more naturalistic child postures, especially the more forward head positions and flexed spinal posture associated with utilizing a portable electronic device."

  "abstract": "Addressing the current complexities, costs, and adherence issues in the detection of forward head posture (FHP), our study conducted an exhaustive epidemiologic investigation, incorporating a comprehensive posture screening process for each participant in China. This research introduces an avant-garde, machine learning-based non-contact method for the accurate discernment of FHP. Our approach elevates detection accuracy by leveraging body landmarks identified from human images, followed by the application of a genetic algorithm for precise feature identification and posture estimation. Observational data corroborates the superior efficacy of the Extra Tree Classifier technique in FHP detection, attaining an accuracy of 82.4%, a specificity of 85.5%, and a positive predictive value of 90.2%. Our model affords a rapid, effective solution for FHP identification, spotlighting the transformative potential of the convergence of feature point recognition and genetic algorithms in non-contact posture detection. The expansive potential and paramount importance of these applications in this niche field are therefore underscored."

  "date": "2023 Sep 11",
  "abstract": "Background: Identifying the prevalence of adenoid hypertrophy (AH) and craniofacial factors associated with this condition requires studies with random sampling from the general population, and multiple criteria can be used for assessing AH on lateral cephalometric radiograph (LCR). The present analysis represents the first report performed according to these requirements in a large cross-sectional sample of children.\nMethods: LCRs of 517 12-year-old children (286 males, 231 females) randomly selected from the general population were retrospectively retrieved. AH was defined using three criteria (At/Nd, Ad-Ba/PNS-Ba, 1-Npaa/Npa), and twelve craniofacial variables were measured (SNA, SNB, ANB, Wits, Cd-Gn, MnP^SN, MxP^MnP, TPFH/TAFH, OPT^SN, C2ps-C4pi^SN, H-CV, H-FH). Skeletal characteristics were compared between children with and without AH using Mann-Whitney U test. Binary logistic regression (adjusted for sex and skeletal growth) was used to independently quantify the association between craniofacial factors and AH.\nResults: The prevalence of children with AH was 17.6% (according to At/Nd), 19.0% (according to Ad-Ba/PNS-Ba), and 13.9% (according to 1-Npaa/Npa). Children with AH presented greater antero-posterior jaw discrepancy (larger ANB, smaller SNB), greater mandibular divergence (larger MnP^SN), forward head posture (larger OPT^SN and C2ps-C4pi^SN), and anteriorly positioned hyoid bone (larger H-CV). Larger SNA (OR = 1.39-1.48), while smaller SNB (OR = 0.77-0.88) and Wits (OR = 0.85-0.87), were associated with greater likelihood of having AH, independently from the assessment method used.\nConclusions: The prevalence of children with AH ranged from 13.9 to 19.0% based on LCR. Greater antero-posterior maxillo-mandibular discrepancy and mandibular retrusion were independently associated with higher likelihood of having AH."

SWE mode was chosen to measure the nuchal fascia shear modulus and muscle thickness was measured in B-mode. Measurements were collected by two independent investigators on two different days. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to measure the relative reliability, and the standard error of measurement (SEM) were used to measure the absolute reliability.\nResults: Intra‑rater (ICC = 0.63-0.89) and inter-rater (ICC = 00.54-0.82) reliability for the nuchal fascia shear modulus were moderate to excellent. Intra‑rater (ICC = 00.64-0.96) and inter-rater (ICC = 00.48-0.86) reliability for upper cervical muscles thickness were moderate to excellent. The SEM percentage oscillated from 3.27% to 13.55%. There were significant differences(P < 0.05) between NHP and FHP on nuchal fascia shear modulus, right side splenius capitis muscle thickness and left side semispinalis capitis muscle thickness, but no significant differences(P > 0.05) were observed between the right and left sides. The upper cervical muscles thickness of males was significantly thicker(P < 0.01) than females while no significant differences were observed (P > 0.05) on the nuchal fascia shear modulus.\nConclusions: Ultrasound-based SWE may be a reliable tool for assessing the stiffness of the nuchal fascia and the thickness of upper cervical muscles in clinical practice.\nRegistration number: ChiCTR2200055736."

  "date": "2023 Jun",
  "abstract": "Dowager's hump is described as excessive kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine with a Cobb angle of more than 40 degrees. This case report presents a 61 years old female office clerk who experienced headaches and neck pain for 3 years that extended into her right shoulder and upper chest. She consulted her primary care physician two months before seeing the chiropractor when the neck pain worsened. A diagnosis of cervicalgia related to osteoarthritis was made based on cervical and thoracic X-ray findings. The patient received non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (celecoxib and etoricoxib) and stretching exercises at home. At the onset of chiropractic care, radiographs showed loss of cervical lordosis, narrowing at the C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-7 intervertebral disc space with marginal osteophytes. Based on these findings, a working diagnosis of cervicogenic headache was established. After treatment for 9 months, the patient showed improvement in symptoms and function from cervical curve radiographic change and dextro-convexity of the thoracic spine. Avoiding forward head flexion and maintaining correct posture in daily activities will be key mechanisms to prevent the reoccurrence of Dowager's hump. The improvement of symptoms following chiropractic therapy has been shown to correlate with radiographic markers of spinal realignment."

Demographic and clinical data of the patients were recorded. Visual Analog Scale (VAS), posture evaluation form, the scapular dyskinesia test, the lateral scapular shift test, and Cobb's methods for cervical angle measurements were used in the evaluation of the patients.\nResults: In the study population, 52.25% of patients had loss of cervical lordosis, and 44.5% of patients had scapular dyskinesia. It was observed that the VAS activity score was significantly higher in individuals with loss of cervical lordosis, all VAS scores and pain duration were significantly higher in individuals with scapular dyskinesia (p<0.05). Shoulder elevation, rounded shoulder, forward head posture, and kyphosis were significantly higher in patients with scapular dyskinesia, while thoracic kyphosis was significantly higher in patients with both scapular dyskinesia and loss of cervical lordosis (p<0.05). The presence of trigger points was found to be significantly higher in patients with scapular dyskinesia and in patients with both scapular dyskinesia and loss of cervical lordosis (p<0.05).\nConclusion: In patients with chronic neck pain diagnosed with myofascial pain syndrome, the presence of loss of cervical lordosis and scapular dyskinesia have negative effects on pain and posture."

  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of three different intervention strategies, postural education (PE) and two corrective exercise programs (CEPs), on the craniovertebral angle (CVA) in young adults with forward head posture (FHP). A prospective four-arm parallel randomized controlled trial with repeated measures was performed. Seventy-nine healthy young adults (55 women, 24 men; mean age: 20.08 ± 2.19 years) with FHP were randomized into four groups: PE group, self-myofascial release + stretching group (SMRS), self-myofascial release + stretching + strengthening group (SMRSS), and a control group (CG). Participant CVA (°) was assessed before and after a 4-week intervention. Seventy-two participants completed the trial. Mean difference comparisons of within-group change in mean CVA revealed an increase in the PE (MD = 3.1, p < .01), SMRS (MD = 3.8, p < .01), and SMRSS (MD = 4.4, p < .01) groups. Mean difference comparison of between-group change in mean CVA supported greater CVA change in the SMRS and SMRSS groups compared to the CG (F(3, 68) = 5.26, p < .01, η2 = .188). All three interventions appear to be effective techniques for improving FHP in young adults, however CEPs may provide superior outcomes than PE alone. A 4-week CEP consisting of self-myofascial release + stretching may yield similar CVA enhancements as a CEP consisting of self-myofascial release + stretching + strengthening. Study findings can assist fitness professionals in designing evidence-based FHP intervention programs for young adults."

  "date": "2023 Aug 21",
  "abstract": "Background: Forward head posture (FHP) is a common condition where the head appears to be positioned in front of the vertical midline of the body. FHP is associated with shortening of the neck extensors and pectoral muscles, and the deep neck flexors and shoulder retractors are weakened. FHP is also found to cause decreases in respiratory function. Few clinical trials have investigated the effects of combination treatments to alleviate these problems. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of combination of traditional Thai massage, scapular stabilization exercise, and chest mobilization on forward head angle (FHA), forced vital capacity (FVC), and cervical flexion in subjects with FHP.\nMethods: Forty-eight subjects with FHP were randomly allocated to a treatment group receiving a Combination of Traditional Thai massage, Scapular stabilization exercise, and Chest mobilization (CTSC group) (n = 24) and a control group (relaxed by lying supine) (n = 24). FHA, FVC, and cervical flexion were measured before and after the four-week intervention (Week 4) and one month after the intervention period (Week 8).\nResults: The CTSC group showed statistically significantly greater improvement in FHA and cervical flexion than the control group at Week 4 (FHA, mean difference - 6.05; 95% CI - 8.03, - 4.07; cervical flexion, mean difference 6.84; 95% CI 3.14, 10.55) and Week 8 (FHA, mean difference - 4.64; 95% CI ( - 6.71, - 2.58); cervical flexion, mean difference 5.21; 95% CI 0.84, 9.58). There were no significant between-group differences in FVC at week 4 (mean difference 0.09; 95% CI - 0.06, 0.23) and week 8 (mean difference 0.04; 95% CI - 0.11, 0.19).\nConclusion: This study showed that CTSC had a positive effect on FHA and cervical flexion in subjects with FHP.\nTrial registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR) (Identification number: TCTR20211119001), registered 19 November 2021; https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20211119001 ."

  "date": "2023 Oct",
  "abstract": "Background: Activity of specific neck muscles is modulated by eye movement. This activity modulation is exaggerated in people with whiplash associated disorders (WAD), but it is unknown whether it is impacted by sitting posture.\nObjective: This study investigated; (i) whether activity of cervical muscles differs with spinal posture; (ii) whether the effect of eye gaze direction (horizontal/vertical) on neck muscle activity differs between postures, and (iii) whether these effects differ between individuals with and without WAD.\nMethods: In three seated postures (normal relaxed, head forward, sit tall) electromyography (EMG) was recorded right obliquus capitis inferior (OI), multifidus (MF), splenius capitis (SP) and left sternocleidomastoid (SCM) with fine-wire and surface electrodes in ten healthy controls and nine with WAD. Electro-oculography recorded eye movements.\nResults: In controls, EMG was less for extensor muscles in Sit Tall than Head Forward, but higher in SCM. Only SC EMG modulated with eye movement. When WAD participants adopted similar sitting postures several responses were different; compared to Normal Relaxed posture OI EMG was less in Head Forward; MF EMG was less in Sit Tall; and SC was less in Head Forward and Sit Tall. Neck muscles in WAD were generally more sensitive to eye movement, except SC which did not modulate.\nConclusions: These finding support the hypothesis that neck muscle activity is influenced by spinal posture and eye movement. In WAD, this relationship is distorted and the response to eye movement is increased.\nSignificance: These observations have potential implications for clinical management of individuals with WAD."

Menstruation-related ailments often correlate with high absenteeism at school and work, as well as limitation of social and scientific activity. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the size of the curvature, the mobility of the spine in the sagittal plane, and menstrual pain in young women. (2) Methods: The analysis included 224 women aged 18-26, mean of 21.56 ± 1.95, studying at the College of Medical Sciences of the University of Rzeszów. For this purpose, the measurement of the anterior-posterior curvature of the spine with a gravitational inclinometer, the Schober test and the authors' questionnaire related to menstruation were used. (3) Results: The data analysis demonstrated a significant difference between the group with menstrual pain (MP) and the control group without pain (CG), where the angle of the lumbar sacral transition (p = 0.034), thoracolumbar transition (p = 0.044) and lumbar lordosis (p = 0.006) were statistically significantly lower in MP compared to CG. There were no significant differences in the measurement of the so-called smartphone hump and between the mobility of the lumbar spine and menstrual pain in any of the groups. (4) Conclusions: Women with menstrual pain are characterized by reduced lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis, while sagittal mobility of the spine does not affect pain."

This study aims to investigate the differential characteristics of gait and posture in early-onset PD (EOPD) and late-onset PD (LOPD) using the Kinect depth camera.\nMethods: Eighty-eight participants, including two subgroups of 22 PD patients and two subgroups of 22 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, sex, and height, were enrolled. Gait and posture features were quantitatively assessed using a Kinect-based system. A two-way analysis of variance was used to compare the difference between different subgroups.\nResults: EOPD had a significantly higher Gait score than LOPD (p = 0.031). Specifically, decreased swing phase (p = 0.034) was observed in the EOPD group. Although the Posture score was similar between the two groups, LOPD was characterized by an increased forward flexion angle of the trunk at the thorax (p = 0.042) and a decreased forward flexion angle of the head relative to the trunk (p = 0.009). Additionally, age-independent features were observed in both PD subgroups, and post hoc tests revealed that EOPD generally performed worse gait features. In comparison, LOPD was characterized by worse performance in posture features.\nConclusions: EOPD and LOPD exhibit different profiles of gait and posture features. The phenotype-specific characteristics likely reflect the distinct neurodegenerative processes between them."

[Participants and Methods] We recruited 20 healthy young adults engaged in high levels of physical activity and 20 healthy young adults engaged in low levels of physical activity. Both groups completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to assess their physical activity levels. The scapular index (SI) was calculated to assess rounded shoulder posture, whereas the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was calculated to assess forward head posture. Differences in SI and CVA between the two groups were examined. [Results] There was a significant difference in the SI between the two groups, with the low physical activity group exhibiting a lower SI than the high physical activity group. However, there was no significant difference in the CVA between the two groups. [Conclusion] Our study showed that low physical activity levels in healthy young adults could negatively affect shoulder posture but not head posture. Therefore, regularly monitoring rounded shoulder posture in individuals with low physical activity levels is recommended for health considerations."

  "date": "2023 Apr 8",
  "abstract": "Background: Forward Head Posture (FHP), which refers to the head being more forward than the shoulder, is one of the most common postural defects of all ages. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of exercise therapy and electroacupuncture in patients with FHP and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS).\nMethods: The present study was an open-label randomized clinical trial. A total of 61 patients with FHP and MPS who were referred to the physical medicine clinic of Besat Hospital between 2020 and 2021 were analyzed. Patients in one group were treated with electroacupuncture, and another one was treated with exercise therapy. The primary outcomes were FHP angles (CVA, CA, and shoulder angle), pain intensity (VAS), and quality of life (SF-12). Paired t-test was used to compare the results obtained in the pre-test and post-test. To detect differences over time, the analysis of variance models was used to repeat the observations. If the p-test result is less than the test significance level of 0.05, the null hypothesis is not confirmed.\nResults: The rate of final CVA and increase in CVA in the exercise therapy group were significantly higher than in the electroacupuncture group (P < 0.001). The average shoulder angle in the exercise therapy group increased from 47.1° ± 3.0° to 51.9° ± 3.3° (P < 0.001) and in the electroacupuncture group from 47.9° ± 3.1° to 51.0° ± 2.8° (P < 0.001). A significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of pain intensity changes during the study.\nConclusion: Overall, the results of this study showed that both exercise therapy and electroacupuncture significantly improved patients' posture, reduced pain intensity, and increased quality of life in FHP patients with MPS; But exercise therapy was more effective in improving FHP angles and electroacupuncture was more successful in reducing patients' pain intensity."

This study involved measuring the children's height and weight, assessing the children's body posture based on the FITS method (Functional Individual Scoliosis Therapy) by Białek and M'hango (the authors of this study), and administering a diagnostic survey addressed to parents and guardians of the children (n = 104) using a self-designed questionnaire.\nResults: Almost all defects were more prevalent in boys, especially in the case of stature triangles (p = 0.0489) and knee alignment in the sagittal plane (p = 0.038). The age of the subjects differentiated the incidence of defects in the scapulae (p = 0.0037) and shoulder (p = 0.0129) alignment, correlating negatively with age. The risk of postural defects for knees (p = 0.0391) and abdominal arching (p = 0.0240) was significant with a higher BMI. The following lifestyle-related factors were significant: the seat for doing homework (stature triangles p = 0.0253), time spent in front of a computer (positioning of the scapulae in relation to each other p = 0.0233; vertical view of the intergluteal cleft p = 0.0324), and snacking between meals (feet p = 0.0003; shoulder positioning p = 0.0013; stature triangles p = 0.0186; positioning of the scapulae in relation to each other p = 0.0404).\nConclusions: The body posture of the examined children was closed with the head pushed forward and drooped, rounded shoulders, hyperlordosis, and pelvic anteversion. Most exhibited various types of abnormalities related to the feet. The recognized risk factors for posture defects are overweight/obesity, the male gender, children who are older, lack of an adjustable work chair, 2 h a day or more spent using the computer, and snacking between meals."

  "title": "The Onset of Musculoskeletal Pain in the COVID-19 Era: A Survey of Physiotherapy Students in Sicily",
  "date": "2023 Jun 28",
  "abstract": "Online teaching has resulted in university students adopting a sedentary lifestyle. Prolonged sitting and reduced physical activity due to pandemic restrictions have led to musculoskeletal pain in various body areas, significantly impacting students' quality of life. This study aims to investigate the effects of remote learning on Sicilian physiotherapy students during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically focusing on the occurrence of musculoskeletal pain. An observational study was conducted using an online survey administered through Google Forms. The survey consisted of 26 multiple-choice questions and was distributed to students enrolled in physiotherapy programs at the universities of Catania, Messina, and Palermo. Participants were contacted via social channels or email, and data collection spanned 5 weeks. The collected data were analyzed using R software. A total of 128 questionnaires were collected. At the time of compilation, most respondents (n = 103/201, 51.2%) were enrolled in the third year of the course of study in physiotherapy at the universities of Catania, Messina, and Palermo. Their ages ranged between 22 and 25 years (43.3%), and most were female (n = 104/201, 51.7%). More than half of the students (51.6%) reported dedicating 15-22 h per week to distance learning for a duration of 6-12 months (50%). Regarding study location, most students preferred studying at a desk (82.8%), and slightly over half (57.8%) adopted a backrest while studying remotely. Analysis of the students' posture during study hours revealed common positions, including tilting the head forward by more than 20 degrees (47.8%), leaning the trunk forward by more than 20 degrees (71.9%), hunching both shoulders forward (57.0%), wrists positioned above the level of the elbows (46.1%), thighs pointing upwards (41.4%), and one or both feet in a downward or dorsiflexed position (69.5%). In conclusion the questionnaire responses indicate that the lifestyle of university students, influenced by online teaching, has deteriorated, leading to musculoskeletal pain, including myofascial pain. These results are primarily influenced by the adopted posture and the duration of time spent in these positions. Additionally, research is needed to identify the most effective therapeutic approaches for managing musculoskeletal pain."

  "title": "Using Machine-Learning to Predict Sleep-Disordered Breathing Diagnosis From Medical Comorbidities and Craniofacial Features",
  "date": "2023 May 31",
  "abstract": "Objectives This paper attempts to use machine-learning (ML) algorithms to predict the presence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in a patient based on their body habitus, craniofacial anatomy, and social history. Materials and methods Data from a group of 69 adult patients who attended a dental clinic for oral surgeries and dental procedures in the last 10 years was used to train machine-learning models to predict whether a subject is likely to have SDB based on input information such as age, gender, smoking history, body mass index (BMI), oropharyngeal airway (Mallampati assessment), forward head posture (FHP), facial skeletal pattern, and sleep quality. Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest Neighbours (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB) were selected as these are the most frequently used supervised machine-learning models for classification of outcomes. The data was split into two sets for machine training (80% of total records) and the remaining was used for testing (validation). Results Initial analysis of collected data showed overweight BMI (at 25 or above), periorbital hyperchromia (dark circle eyes), nasal deviation, micrognathia, convex facial skeletal pattern (class 2) and Mallampati class 2 or above have positive correlations with SDB. Logistic Regression was found to be the best performer amongst the four models used with an accuracy of 86%, F1 score of 88% and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 93%. LR also had 100% specificity and 77.8% sensitivity. Support Vector Machine was the second-best performer with an accuracy of 79%, F1 score of 82% and AUC of 93%. k-Nearest Neighbours and Naïve Bayes performed reasonably well with F1 scores of 71% and 67%, respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated the feasibility of using simple machine-learning models as a credible predictor of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with structural risk factors for sleep apnoea such as craniofacial anomalies, neck posture and soft tissue airway obstruction. By utilising higher-level machine-learning algorithms, it is possible to incorporate a broader range of risk factors, including non-structural features like respiratory diseases, asthma, medication use, and more, into the prediction model."

  "title": "Changes in the mean incidence and variance of orthopedic diseases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea: a retrospective study",
  "date": "2023 Jul 1",
  "abstract": "Background: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the amount of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity significantly decreased. Therefore, the epidemiology of musculoskeletal diseases could possibly have changed. We assessed changes in the incidence of and variance in non-traumatic orthopedic diseases before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea.\nMethods: This study included data from the Korea National Health Insurance Service, which covers the entire Korean population (approximately 50 million), from January 2018 to June 2021. Using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes, 12 common orthopedic diseases were evaluated, including cervical disc disorders, lumbar disc disorders, forward head posture, myofascial pain syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, frozen shoulder, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, hip fracture, distal radius fracture, and spine fracture diseases. \"Pre-COVID-19\" was the period until February 2020, and \"COVID-19 pandemic period\" was the period starting March 2020. Differences in the mean incidence and variance of diseases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared.\nResults: In most cases, the incidence of orthopedic diseases decreased at the beginning of the pandemic and then increased thereafter. Among the 12 diseases, the incidence of three diseases showed a statistically significant change. The incidence of myofascial pain syndrome (P < 0.001) was lower during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the pre-COVID-19 period. The incidences of frozen shoulder (P < 0.001) and gout (P = 0.043) were higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the pre-COVID-19 period. However, no statistical difference in disease variations was observed between the two periods.\nConclusions: The incidence of orthopedic diseases varied during the COVID-19 pandemic among the Korean population. Although the incidence of myofascial pain syndrome was lower, that of frozen shoulder and gout was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the pre-COVID-19 period. No disease variations during the COVID-19 pandemic were found."

  "title": "On-Field and Pitch-Side (Sideline) Assessment of Sports Concussion in Collision Sports: An Expert Consensus Statement Using the Modified Delphi Technique",
  "date": "2024 Feb",
  "abstract": "Purpose: To perform a Delphi consensus for on-field and pitch-side assessment of sports-related concussion (SRC).\nMethods: Open-ended questions in rounds 1 and 2 were answered. The results of the first 2 rounds were used to develop a Likert-style questionnaire for round 3. If agreement at round 3 was ≤80% for an item, if panel members were outside consensus, or there were >30% neither agree/disagree responses, the results were carried forward into round 4. The level of agreement and consensus was defined as 90%.\nResults: Loss of consciousness (LOC) or suspected LOC, motor incoordination/ataxia, balance disturbance, confusion/disorientation, memory disturbance/amnesia, blurred vision/light sensitivity, irritability, slurred speech, slow reaction time, lying motionless, dizziness, headaches/pressure in the head, falling to the ground with no protective action, slow to get up after a hit, dazed look, and posturing/seizures were clinical signs of SRC and indicate removal from play. Video assessment is helpful but should not replace clinical judgment. LOC/unresponsiveness, signs of cervical spine injury, suspicion of other fractures (skull/maxillo-facial), seizures, Glasgow Coma Scale score <14 and abnormal neurologic examination findings are indications for hospitalization. Return to play should only be considered when no clinical signs of SRC are present. Every suspected concussion should be referred to an experienced physician.\nConclusions: Consensus was achieved for 85% of the clinical signs indicating concussion. On-field and pitch-side assessment should include the observation of the mechanism, a clinical examination, and cervical spine assessment. Of the 19 signs and red flags requiring removal from play, consensus was reached for 74%. Normal clinical examination and HIA with no signs of concussion allow return to play. Video assessment should be mandatory for professional games but should not replace clinical decision-making. Sports Concussion Assessment Tool, Glasgow Coma Scale, vestibular/ocular motor screening, Head Injury Assessment Criteria 1, and Maddocks questions are useful tools. Guidelines are helpful for non-health professionals.\nLevel of evidence: Level V, expert opinion."

  "date": "2023 Jun",
  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze short-term variations in posture and intensity of neck and lower back pain in women undergoing lipoabdominoplasty.\nMethods: This prospective case series study involved 17 women (age 43 ± 12 years, presurgical body mass index 27.0 ± 3.7 kg/m2). Participants were assessed preoperatively (T0) and at 15 (T15) and 30 days (T30) after surgery for clinical data (number of pregnancies, number of deliveries, presurgical body mass), neck and lower back angles calculated by photogrammetry, and pain intensity by numeric pain rating scale. Postoperative complications were assessed at T15 and T30.\nResults: After adjusting for age and presurgical body mass index, there was an increase in forward head position in T15 and a return by T30 (marginal R2 = 0.411). The lower back showed an increase in flexion at T15 and return by T30 (marginal R2 = 0.266). No statistical evidence of significance was observed for changes in the intensity of neck (P > .355) or lower back (P > .293) pain. Complications were mild and common at T15; most of them resumed at T30.\nConclusion: A transient, nonlinear compensatory change in neck and lower back lordosis was observed 15 days after lipoabdominoplasty, with almost full recovery in the short term (30 days). No systematic change in pain intensity was observed within this period. Postsurgical complications were mild and common, and most of them resumed shortly after surgery."

  "abstract": "Food rewards are believed to have a positive valence in horses. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of food rewards on horse behavior before entering a horse chute, and behavior and facial movements while restrained in it. Thirteen female adult horses were brought once daily to an animal handling facility for three weeks. In week 1, baseline period, no reinforcement was applied. In weeks 2 and 3, experimental phase, half of the horses received positive reinforcement treatment after entering and remaining in the chute; the remaining horses were considered as controls (no positive reinforcement applied). There was a cross-over between the groups during the experimental phase. Horses were individually brought to the restraining chute and videos recorded during 60-sec. The duration and number of entries into the area close to the gate leading to the chute were measured before restraining and body posture, neck position, and tail swinging were recorded in the chute. Facial movements were also recorded and scored using EquiFACS methodology. Multilevel linear and logistic models were built to assess behavioral changes from baseline to the treatment phase and between phases (control and positively reinforced). Horses did not change their body posture or tail swings across the different phases (P > 0.1) and were less likely to show lowered neck during the positively reinforced phase (OR: 0.05; CI95%: 0.00-0.56; P = 0.05) compared to baseline. The likelihood of a lowered neck did not differ between the positive reinforcement and control phases (P = 0.11). In the positively reinforced phase, horses seemed to be more attentive (ears forward) and active (less eye closures, more nose movements) than in the control phase. A three-day positive reinforcement phase did not elicit major changes in body behavior in the chute but affected the facial movements of group-housed mares."

  "title": "Is Thoracic Kyphosis Relevant to Pain, Autonomic Nervous System Function, Disability, and Cervical Sensorimotor Control in Patients with Chronic Nonspecific Neck Pain?",
  "date": "2023 May 27",
  "abstract": "There is great interest in thoracic kyphosis, as it is thought to be a contributor to neck pain, neck disability, and sensorimotor control measures; however, this has not been completely investigated in treatment or case control studies. This case control design investigated participants with non-specific chronic neck pain. Eighty participants with a defined hyper-kyphosis (>55°) were compared to eighty matched participants with normal thoracic kyphosis (<55°). Participants were matched for age and neck pain duration. Hyper-kyphosis was further categorized into two distinct types: postural kyphosis (PK) and Scheuermann's kyphosis (SK). Posture measures included formetric thoracic kyphosis and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) to assess forward head posture. Sensorimotor control was assessed by the following measures: smooth pursuit neck torsion test (SPNT), overall stability index (OSI), and left and right rotation repositioning accuracy. A measure of autonomic nervous system function included the amplitude and latency of skin sympathetic response (SSR). Differences in variable measures were examined using the Student's t-test to compare the means of continuous variables between the two groups. One-way ANOVA was used to compare mean values in the three groups: postural kyphosis, Scheuermann's kyphosis, and normal kyphosis group. Pearson correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between participant's thoracic kyphosis magnitude (in each group separately and as an entire population) and their CVA, SPNT, OSI, head repositioning accuracy, and SSR latency and amplitude. Hyper-kyphosis participants had a significantly greater neck disability index compared to the normal kyphosis group (p < 0.001) with the SK group having greatest disability (p < 0.001). Statistically significant differences between the two kyphosis groups and the normal kyphosis group for all the sensorimotor measured variables were identified with the SK group having the most decreased efficiency of the measures in the hyper-kyphosis group, including: SPNT, OSI, and left and right rotation repositioning accuracy. In addition, there was a significant difference in neurophysiological findings for SSR amplitude (entire sample of kyphosis vs. normal kyphosis, p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference for SSR latency (p = 0.07). The CVA was significantly greater in the hyper-kyphosis group (p < 0.001). The magnitude of the thoracic kyphosis correlated with worsening CVA (with the SK group having the smallest CVA; p < 0.001) and the magnitude of the decreased efficiency of the sensorimotor control measures and the amplitude and latency of the SSR. The PK group, overall, showed the greatest correlations between thoracic kyphosis and measured variables. Participants with hyper-thoracic kyphosis exhibited abnormal sensorimotor control and autonomic nervous system dysfunction compared to those with normal thoracic kyphosis."

  "title": "Neck pain repercussions in migraine - The role of physiotherapy",
  "date": "2023 Aug",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Migraine is a neurological and disabling disease whose peripheral manifestations can be addressed with physiotherapy. These manifestations can include pain and hypersensitivity to muscular and articular palpation in the neck and face region, a higher prevalence of myofascial trigger points, limitation in global cervical motion, especially in the upper segment (C1-C2), and forward head posture with worse muscular performance. Furthermore, patients with migraine can present cervical muscle weakness and greater co-activation of antagonists in maximum and submaximal tasks. In addition to musculoskeletal repercussions, these patients can also present balance impairment and a greater risk of falls, especially when chronicity of migraine frequency is present. The physiotherapist is a relevant player in the interdisciplinary team and can help these patients to control and manage their migraine attacks.\nPurpose: This position paper discusses the most relevant musculoskeletal repercussions of migraine in the craniocervical area under the perspective of sensitization and disease chronification, besides addressing physiotherapy as an important strategy for evaluating and treating these patients.\nImplications: Physiotherapy as a non-pharmacological treatment option in migraine treatment may potentially reduce musculoskeletal impairments related to neck pain in this population. Disseminating knowledge about the different types of headaches and the diagnostic criteria can support physiotherapists who compose a specialized interdisciplinary team. Furthermore, it is important to acquire competencies in neck pain assessment and treatment approaches according to the current evidence."

  "title": "The cervical spine in tension type headache",
  "date": "2023 Aug",
  "abstract": "Introduction: The concept that headaches may originate in the cervical spine has been discussed over decades and is still a matter of debate. The cervical spine has been traditionally linked to cervicogenic headache; however, current evidence supports the presence of cervical musculoskeletal dysfunctions also in tension-type headache.\nPurpose: This position paper discusses the most updated clinical and evidence-based data about the cervical spine in tension-type headache.\nImplications: Subjects with tension-type headache exhibit concomitant neck pain, cervical spine sensitivity, forward head posture, limited cervical range of motion, positive flexion-rotation test and also cervical motor control disturbances. In addition, the referred pain elicited by manual examination of the upper cervical joints and muscle trigger points reproduces the pain pattern in tension-type headache. Current data supports that the cervical spine can be also involved in tension-type headache, and not just in cervicogenic headache. Several physical therapies including upper cervical spine mobilization or manipulation, soft tissue interventions (including dry needling) and exercises targeting the cervical spine are proposed for managing tension-type headache; however, the effectiveness of these interventions depends on a proper clinical reasoning since not all will be equally effective for all individuals with tension-type headache. Based on current evidence, we propose to use the terms cervical \"component\" and cervical \"source\" when discussing about headache. In such a scenario, in cervicogenic headache the neck can be the cause (source) of the headache whereas in tension-type headache the neck will have a component on the pain pattern, but it will be not the cause since it is a primary headache."

  "date": "2023",
  "abstract": "Objective: Belt-positioning booster seats (BPB) and pre-pretensioner (PPT) belts may be effective in preventing injuries from submarining and head excursion in reclined children. It is unknown if injuries at the neck and spine could still occur. This study's goal is to characterize neck and spine responses in reclined children with and without the BPB and the PPT.\nMethods: Eleven frontal impact sled tests were performed (56 kph) with the Large Omnidirectional Child (LODC) dummy on a production vehicle seat. A 3-point simulated seat-integrated-belt was used with a load-limiter (∼4.5 kN). Testing was conducted with and without the BPB with the seatback at ∼25°, ∼45° and repeated once. One test was conducted at ∼60° with the BPB. 100 mm of belt-slack was removed to simulate PPT in two 45° BPB tests and the BPB 60° test. The LODC peak thoracic spine accelerations and angular rotations, and peak neck and lumbar force/moment loads were compared between conditions.\nResults: Neck shear forces were the highest in the 60° BPB & PPT (-1.9 kN) and 45° noBPB (-1.3 kN) than all other BPB conditions (-0.5 to -0.8 kN). The highest peak neck moments were found in the 45° noBPB (-40.5 N-m), and in the 60° BPB & PPT (-34.2 N-m) conditions compared to all others (-20.8 to -27.9 N-m.). The 60° BPB and PPT condition demonstrated thoracic forward rotation similar to the 25° noBPB condition (25° noBPB -24.8 to -35.0 deg, 60° BPB&PPT -27.5 to -43.2 deg.). Thoracic spine peak resultant accelerations (T1, T6, T12) were higher in the 25° and 45° noBPB conditions (53 g to 71 g) and in the 60° BPB & PPT (T6: 61.8 g) compared to all other BPB conditions (48.4 g to 53.1 g). The lumbar peak shear forces and moments were the highest in the 45° noBPB (4.9 kN, -296 N-m) and the 60° BPB & PPT condition (1.7 kN, -146 N-m).\nConclusion: These findings show similarities in neck, spine, and lumbar responses between the 60° reclined condition with BPB and PPT and the 25° and 45° conditions without the same countermeasures. This study highlights the need for future restraint developments to protect moderate and severe reclined BPB-seated child occupants."

  "title": "Effect of naturalistic seating postures and seatbelt routing on booster-seated Q6 ATD kinematics and kinetics in frontal impacts",
  "date": "2023 Sep",
  "abstract": "Research questions / objective: Test protocols evaluate restraint performance with pediatric ATDs placed in an ideal seating posture. However, real-world evidence suggests that ideal test conditions do not always reflect actual occupant positions. Prior studies have also shown that booster seat designs affect the position of the seatbelt around the child. Occupants in naturalistic seating postures, coupled with potentially unfavorable seatbelt positions, could result in adverse kinematics and kinetics in a crash. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the effect of different naturalistic seating postures on the response of the Q6 ATD restrained on boosters with varying initial static belt fit in a frontal impact.\nMethods/data sources: The Q6 ATD was positioned on two booster seats of similar design but varying static belt fit metrics in three seating postures: reference, leaning forward, and leaning inboard. These booster seats were chosen from extensive belt fit studies on human volunteers and ATDs, and were defined as follows:The booster-seated ATD was restrained on the simulated Consumer Reports test buck (2010 Ford Flex 2nd row seat) with a front blocker plate using a 3-point lap-shoulder belt with a retractor and pretensioner. The sled environment was subjected to the FMVSS 213 frontal impact pulse, and each booster and seating posture was evaluated twice (n = 12 sled tests). Kinematic and kinetic measures were recorded. A linear regression analysis was conducted across postures on each booster. Further, a paired t-test analysis was conducted across booster seats for each seating posture.\nResults: Across seating postures, the reference posture exhibited similar or higher kinematic and kinetic metric values compared to the leaning forward and leaning inboard postures on both boosters. However, both leaning forward (Booster A = 279.5 ± 21.6 mm; Booster B = 298.8 ± 1.5 mm) and leaning inboard (Booster A = 308.7 ± 1.1 mm; Booster B = 331.4 ± 8.5 mm) postures generally resulted in greater head excursion than the reference posture (Booster A = 285.0 ± 16.9 mm; Booster B = 288.1 ± 1.5 mm), indicating greater potential for head contact. Between boosters, Booster A resulted in significantly lower head 3 ms clip acceleration (p = 0.0026), HIC15 (p = 0.0008), upper neck tensile force (Fz)(p = 0.0057), chest 3 ms clip acceleration (p = 0.0013), and right abdominal pressure (p = 0.0163), and significantly higher left ASIS force (Fx)(p = 0.0150) and left (p = 0.0489) and right (p = 0.0088) ASIS moment (My) than Booster B. Upper neck tensile forces on Booster B crossed the 20% and 50% thresholds for AIS3 + injury. Lower abdominal pressure and higher ASIS forces and moments on Booster A suggest that the lap belt loaded the ASIS appropriately, and hence, relatively better kinematics than Booster B.\nSignificance of results: This study shows that booster design affects static belt fit which can have an effect on dynamic crash performance and assessment criteria. By connecting static belt fit to dynamic performance, these effects may have the potential to help guide booster seat design."

  "abstract": "Background: Both the development of various countries and people's health were impacted by the unforeseen global COVID-19 outbreak. Many countries prefer to do their daily business online. Although it was incredibly useful at the time, it still had a problem that was not properly addressed, especially among the student population.\nObjective: The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of upper extremity neural mobility among students who were using smart devices during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethods: 458 students who had previously taken home-based online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic and used a smart device for more than six hours were included in this study. The study was conducted in three phases. After being examined in the first two stages of the study, a total of 72 people were chosen for the final phase. Peripheral nerve mobility tests were performed on these 72 subjects.\nResults: This study observed that 15.72% of smart device users have been affected by forward neck posture and impaired peripheral nerve mobility in the cervical spine.\nConclusion: The study concludes that forward neck posture is associated with impaired peripheral nerve mobility among smart device users who were in home-based online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Hence, we suggest an appropriate treatment strategy focusing on preventing the forward neck posture through timely analysis and self-care therapies."

  "title": "Does Forward Head Posture Influence Somatosensory Evoked Potentials and Somatosensory Processing in Asymptomatic Young Adults?",
  "date": "2023 Apr 29",
  "abstract": "The current investigation used somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to assess differences in sensorimotor integration and somatosensory processing variables between asymptomatic individuals with and without forward head posture (FHP). We assessed different neural regions of the somatosensory pathway, including the amplitudes of the peripheral N9, spinal N13, brainstem P14, peak-to-peak amplitudes of parietal N20 and P27, and frontal N30 potentials. Central conduction time (N13-N20) was measured as the difference in peak latencies of N13 and N20. We measured these variables in 60 participants with FHP defined as a craniovertebral angle (CVA) < 50° and 60 control participants matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) with normal FHP defined as CVA > 55°. Differences in variable measures were examined using the parametric t-test. Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between the CVA and sensorimotor integration and SEP measurements. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to compare the SEP measures between groups, with adjustment for educational level, marital status, BMI, and working hours per week. There were statistically significant differences between the FHP group and control group for all sensorimotor integration and SEP processing variables, including the amplitudes of spinal N13 (p < 0.005), brainstem P14 (p < 0.005), peak-to-peak amplitudes of parietal N20 and P27 (p < 0.005), frontal N30 potentials (p < 0.005), and the conduction time N13-N20 (p = 0.004). The CVA significantly correlated with all measured neurophysiological variables indicating that as FHP increased, sensorimotor integration and SEP processing became less efficient. FHP group correlations were: N9 (r = -0.44, p < 0.001); N13 (r = -0.67, p < 0.001); P14 (r = -0.58, p < 0.001); N20 (r = -0.49, p = 0.001); P27 (r = -0.58, p < 0.001); N30 potentials (r = -0.64, p < 0.001); and N13-N20 (r = -0.61, p < 0.001). GLM identified that increased working hours adversely affected the SEP measures (p < 0.005), while each 1° increase in the CVA was associated with improved SEP amplitudes and more efficient central conduction time (N13-N20; p < 0.005). Less efficient sensorimotor integration and SEP processing may be related to previous scientific reports of altered sensorimotor control and athletic skill measures in populations with FHP. Future investigations should seek to replicate our findings in different spine disorders and symptomatic populations in an effort to understand how improving forward head posture might benefit functional outcomes of patient care."

  "date": "2023 Dec",
  "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of neck pain due to the overuse of mobile phones has been reported among university students.\nAim: This study aims to investigate the impact of self-management corrective exercises on text neck syndrome among university students using smartphones.\nMethods: This experimental study was conducted on 60 students in the two experimental and control groups. Demographic information and the Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaires were used for data collection. The Severity of Neck Pain (SNP) was determined using the visual analog scale. The head and neck tilt angles, the gaze angle, and the amount of change in the forward head posture were determined using photogrammetry and Kinovea software. The experimental group performed corrective exercises 5 days a week for 8 weeks. The desired variables were re-determined in both groups after the intervention.\nResults: The SNP and NDI in the experimental group after the intervention decreased by 0.61-1.45, and 1.20-5.14, respectively. Significant differences between the measured variables before and after the intervention in the experimental group showed that the head tilt angle (7.17-22.30 degrees), gaze angle (3.21-23.5 degrees), and forward head posture (3.26-5.42 cm) were reduced, and the neck tilt angle (2.00-17.24 degrees) increased and improved after the intervention in various measurement positions.\nConclusions: After performing the corrective exercises, 36.6% of the SNP and 13.3% of the NDI were reduced in the experimental group. Head and neck angles during using smartphones in a sitting position on a chair without a backrest were the most awkward posture compared with other postures."

  "title": "Relationship between foot pressure and spinal parameters in healthy adults - A systematic review",
  "date": "2023 Jun",
  "abstract": "Background: Foot pressure has an essential impact on the entire musculoskeletal chain. So far, the direct influence of foot pressure onto the spinal posture and vice versa is still unclear.\nResearch question: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between foot pressure and spinal posture in healthy adults under static and dynamic conditions.\nMethods: Systematic research was conducted using PubMed to demonstrate the relationship between foot pressure and spinal posture. The search strategy was based on the PICOS selection criteria. The risk of bias within the studies was assessed using SIGN rankings.\nResults: Based on the search strategy, 719 articles were identified by screening title and abstract. 11 studies with moderate methodological quality partially showed a relationship between foot pressure and spinal posture (SIGN:2-1- and B-D). Apart from the foot pressure, the included studies analyzed parameters of muscle thickness (sonography), trunk displacement, head position, posterior tilt angle, trunk tilt, pelvic rotation, spinal range of motion, or spinal motion. Strength training and increased muscle thickness in the lumbar spine ensure decreased foot pressure. The head position partly induces a change of foot pressure under static conditions. No correlation was identified between spinal posture and foot pressure during forward and backward walking without manipulation. The static and dynamic measurements only show statistical correlations between foot and back muscles.\nSignificance: Foot pressure and spinal posture seem to be interrelated under static and dynamic conditions. Static and dynamic measurements are necessary for body posture analysis, as the conditions do not always show consistent results. Due to the small number of studies and low sample sizes, further investigations are necessary to gain more precise perception of the interplay of the spine and foot pressure. For better comparison, more homogeneous studies investigating similar spine parameters are needed."

  "date": "2023 May",
  "abstract": "[Purpose] To present a case demonstrating dramatic restoration of the cervical lordosis and reduction of forward head posture by use of Chiropractic BioPhysics® (CBP®) technique. [Participant and Methods] A 24-year-old cervical asymptomatic female presented with poor craniocervical posture. Radiography revealed forward head posture and an exaggerated cervical kyphosis. [Results] The patient received CBP care including mirror image® cervical extension exercises, cervical extension traction and spinal manipulative therapy. After 36 treatments over 17-weeks, repeat radiography demonstrated a dramatic improvement of an alteration of the cervical kyphosis to a lordosis and a reduction of forward head posture. Subsequent treatment increased the lordosis further. Long-term follow-up at 3.5 years showed some loss of original correction, however, a maintenance of the global lordosis. [Conclusion] This case demonstrates that non-surgical reversal of a cervical kyphosis to a lordosis is possible in a short time using CBP cervical extension protocols. It is logical if the kyphosis had not been corrected, over time, osteoarthritis and various craniovertebral symptoms would have evolved as the literature indicates. The diagnosis of gross spinal deformity, we argue, requires its correction prior to the onset of symptoms and permanent degenerative changes."

  "title": "Head posture mediates the association of cognition with hand grip and pinch strength in older adults: an examination using structural equation modeling",
  "date": "2023 Apr 25",
  "abstract": "Background: The association of cognition with hand grip and pinch strength has been well-recognized in older adults. The authors sought to explore: (1) associations among forward head posture (FHP), cognition, and hand grip and pinch strength in older adults; and (2) the mediator role of FHP in these pathways using structural equation modeling (SEM).\nMethods: This cross-sectional study included 88 older adults (70.5% male; mean age = 68.75±3.87 years). Cognition was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), head posture by the Craniovertebral Angle (CVA) obtained from photographic analysis, hand grip strength by a handheld dynamometer, and pinch strength by a pinch meter. Using the two SEMs, a potential mediator role of the CVA was investigated. While the MMSE was addressed as an independent variable in both models, hand grip and pinch strength were addressed as dependent variables in model 1 and model 2, respectively.\nResults: The correlations between the CVA and MMSE (r = 0.310), hand grip strength (r = 0.370), and pinch strength (r = 0.274 to 0.292) were statistically significant (p < 0.001). In addition, significant associations were found between the MMSE and hand grip and pinch strength, ranging from 0.307 to 0.380 (p < 0.001). The mediation analysis showed that the standardized total (β = 0.41, p < 0.001) and indirect (mediated) effects (β = 0.12, p = 0.008) of the MMSE on hand grip strength were significant in model (1) The results were similar for model (2) The standardized total (β = 0.39, p = 0.001) and indirect effects (β = 0.10, p = 0.026) of the MMSE on pinch strength were significant. As a partial mediator in both models, the CVA explained 29% and 26% of the total effect in models 1 and 2, respectively.\nConclusions: The CVA was associated with the MMSE, hand grip strength, and pinch strength, and CVA partially mediates the association of the MMSE with grip and pinch strength in older adults, indicating that cognition had an effect on grip and pinch strength through an indirect path via head posture. This finding reveals that evaluating head posture and providing corrective therapeutic interventions as needed may be beneficial in reducing the negative impact of decreased cognition on motor functions in older adults."

  "title": "How to Train Your Posture: Haptic Feedback Can be Used for Postural Adaptation of the Trunk During Upper-Limb Motor Training",
  "date": "2023 Apr-Jun",
  "abstract": "Poor trunk posture, especially during long periods of sitting, could lead to problems such as Low Back Pain (LBP) and Forward Head Posture (FHP). Typical solutions are based on visual or vibration-based feedback. However, these systems could lead to feedback being ignored by the user and phantom vibration syndrome, respectively. In this study, we propose using haptic feedback for postural adaptation. In this two-part study, twenty-four healthy participants (age 25.87 ± 2.17 years) adapted to three different postural targets in the anterior direction while performing a unimanual reaching task using a robotic device. Results suggest a strong adaptation to the desired postural targets. Mean anterior trunk bending after the intervention is significantly different compared to baseline measurements for all postural targets. Additional analysis of movement straightness and smoothness indicates an absence of any negative interference of posture-based feedback on the performance of reaching movement. Taken together, these results suggest that haptic feedback-based systems could be used for postural adaptation applications. Also, this type of postural adaptation system can be used during the rehabilitation of stroke patients to reduce trunk compensation in lieu of typical physical constraint-based methods."

  "date": "2023 Feb 23",
  "abstract": "The current study aimed to determine whether participants with and without forward head posture (FHP) would respond differently in cervical nerve root function to various sitting positions. We measured peak-to-peak dermatomal somatosensory-evoked potentials (DSSEPs) in 30 participants with FHP and in 30 participants matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) with normal head posture (NHP), defined as having a craniovertebral angle (CVA) >55°. Additional inclusion criteria for recruitment were individuals between the ages of 18 and 28 who were in good health and had no musculoskeletal pain. All 60 participants underwent C6, C7, and C8 DSSEPs evaluation. The measurements were taken in three positions: erect sitting, slouched sitting, and supine. We identified statistically significant differences in the cervical nerve root function in all postures between the NHP and FHP groups (p < 0.001), indicating that the FHP and NHP reacted differently in different positions. No significant differences between groups for the DSSEPs were identified for the supine position (p > 0.05), in contrast to the erect and slouched sitting positions, which showed a significant difference in nerve root function between the NHP and FHP (p < 0.001). The NHP group results were consistent with the prior literature and had the greatest DSSEP peaks when in the upright position. However, the participants in the FHP group demonstrated the largest peak-to-peak amplitude of DSSEPs while in the slouched position as opposed to an erect position. The optimal sitting posture for cervical nerve root function may be dependent upon the underlying CVA of a person, however, further research is needed to corroborate these findings."

  "date": "2023 Feb 25",
  "abstract": "The posture-analyzing and virtual reconstructing device (PAViR) used a Red Green Blue-Depth camera as a sensor and skeleton reconstruction images were produced. This PAViR quickly analyzed the whole posture from multiple repetitive shots without radiation exposure in clothes and provided a virtual skeleton within seconds. This study aims to evaluate the reliability when shooting repeatedly and to assess the validity compared to parameters of full-body, low-dose X-rays (EOSs) when applied as diagnostic imaging. As a prospective and observational study, 100 patients with musculoskeletal pain underwent an EOS to obtain whole body coronal and sagittal images. The outcome measures were human posture parameters, which were divided by the standing plane in both EOSs and PAViRs as follows: (1) a coronal view (asymmetric clavicle height, pelvic oblique, bilateral Q angles of the knee, and center of seventh cervical vertebra-central sacral line (C7-CSL)) and (2) a sagittal view (forward head posture). A validation of the PAViR compared to the EOSs revealed that C7-CSL showed a moderate positive correlation with that of the EOS (r = 0.42, p < 0.01). The forward head posture (r = 0.39, p < 0.01), asymmetric clavicle height (r = 0.37, p < 0.01), and pelvic oblique (r = 0.32, p < 0.01) compared to those of the EOS had slightly positive correlations. The PAViR has excellent intra-rater reliability in people with somatic dysfunction. Except for both Q angles, the PAViR has fair-to-moderate validation when compared to EOS diagnostic imaging in the parameter representing coronal and sagittal imbalance. Although the PAViR system is not yet available in the medical field, it has the potential to become a radiation-free, accessible, and cost-effective postural analysis diagnostic tool after the EOS era."

  "date": "2023 Mar 1",
  "abstract": "Pressure-flow travelling waves are a key topic for understanding arterial haemodynamics. However, wave transmission and reflection processes induced by body posture changes have not been thoroughly explored yet. Current in vivo research has shown that the amount of wave reflection detected at a central level (ascending aorta, aortic arch) decreases during tilting to the upright position, despite the widely proved stiffening of the cardiovascular system. It is known that the arterial system is optimized when in the supine position, i.e. propagation of direct waves is enabled and reflected waves are trapped, protecting the heart; however, it is not known whether this is preserved with postural changes. To shed light on these aspects, we propose a multi-scale modelling approach to inquire into posture-induced arterial wave dynamics elicited by simulated head-up tilting. In spite of remarkable adaptation of the human vasculature following posture changes, our analysis shows that, upon tilting from supine to upright: (i) vessel lumens at arterial bifurcations remain well matched in the forward direction, (ii) wave reflection at central level is reduced due to the backward propagation of weakened pressure waves produced by cerebral autoregulation, and (iii) backward wave trapping is preserved."

  "date": "2023",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to make the comparison of the kinematics and possible injury values of the occupant in the highly reclined seating position in two cases: the first case is without the braking maneuver prior to the frontal crash, and the second case is considering the braking maneuver prior to the impact.\nMethods: This study used the MADYMO human body model 50th percentile mid-size male seated on the front passenger seat model with the seatback reclined rearward 53° (fully reclined seatback) to simulate the occupant biomechanics and behavior during a frontal collision. To achieve the study aim, two simulation models were created. The first model is called the non-precrash model (VaAM-O). It was set to simulate the occupant kinematics in the fully reclined initial seating posture in the 200 ms of a crash without the braking maneuver before the crash. The second model, called the precrash model (VaAM-I), identified the occupant's initial position after the car model performed a 1s deceleration of a braking maneuver. VaAM-I has then also simulated the occupant kinematics in 200 ms of a crash.\nResults: This study showed a significant difference in the occupant's posture at the beginning of the crash phase in the two cases. The upper torso of VaAM-I rotated up and moved forward earlier than VaAM-O prior to the crash phase due to the influence of the braking maneuver, and at the 50 ms, when the airbag deployed completely, the head had no contact with the airbag, and the head in VaAM-I forwarded to the airbag closer than VaAM-O about 24% of the distance to the airbag.\nConclusions: This study supplements the value data for the study of the out-of-position OOP of the occupant in the frontal crash. The contact force and position contact between the head and the airbag could attract the audience's attention. On the other hand, a comparison of the seatbelt force and the seatbelt contacts the body between the conventional seatbelt as in this study, and the seat-integrated seatbelt system in the case wherein the occupant seats on the front seat with a highly reclined seatback should be performed."

  "abstract": "Objective: The study objectives were to identify the prevalence of upper crossed syndrome (UCS) and its associated factors in a population of Spanish adolescents, and to explore these associations through focus groups.\nMethods: The study used a sequential explanatory mixed method design. The quantitative phase consisted of a cross-sectional study in which 45 students underwent photogrammetry measurements and evaluations with the Kiddo-KINDL and VISA-TEEN questionnaires. Subsequently, several focus groups were conducted to discuss the quantitative results.\nResults: The results indicated a 37.8% prevalence of UCS, a 48.9% prevalence of forward head posture (FHP) and an 80% prevalence of forward shoulder posture (FSP). A positive FSP was indicated by an angle represented by the intersection of the line between the midpoint of the humerus and the spinous process of C7 of <52°. FSP was significantly higher in boys (mean [M] = 43.59, standard deviation [SD] = 6.9) than in girls (M = 47.98, SD = 6.33; p < 0.05). Boys showed significant moderate associations of FSP with body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.48, p < 0.05) and hygiene habits (r = -0.46, p < 0.05), and of FHP with worse use of technology (r = 0.53, p < 0.05). Those with UCS showed significant differences in school performance (M = 47.22, SD = 8.33, p < 0.05). Analysis of the qualitative results led to the identification of 33 codes and five categories.\nConclusions: UCS was associated with factors such as BMI, school performance, use of technology and physical activity. Correcting posture in adolescence was generally believed to be necessary. Physical exercise and postural health were considered highly important among adolescents."

  "date": "2023 Feb 6",
  "abstract": "The concepts of \"optimal posture (OP)\" and \"harmful posture (HP)\" are commonly used, and specific spinal postures can contribute to back pain. However, quantitative descriptions of optimal and harmful standing (StP) and sitting (SP) postures are currently lacking, particularly for different body mass indices (BMIs). Therefore, this study aimed to identify and quantify the OPs and HPs of StP and SP at different BMIs and investigate the attitudes and beliefs of rehabilitation practitioners toward OPs and HPs. Overall, 552 rehabilitation practitioners were recruited to participate in a questionnaire survey to select the optimal position from seven sitting and five standing postures for each BMI healthy volunteer. The segmental relationships of each posture were qualified using the Vicon software. For normal BMI, the physiotherapists chose two SPs (48.19% and 49.64%) and one StP (80.42%) as the OP. One sitting SP (83.7%) and two standing StPs (43.48% and 48.19%) were selected as optimal for obese BMI. All the most commonly selected OPs had an upright lordotic posture, while the postures with slouched spinal curves or forward head postures were almost all selected as HP. Additionally, 96.74% of participants considered education about optimal SP and StP to be \"quite\" or \"very\" important. The OP of the StP and SP postures was mostly based on the vertical alignment of gravity lines and sagittal balance. For obese people, the rehabilitation practitioners' observations may be erroneous, and further physical examination is necessary. Rehabilitation practitioners generally believe that postural education is essential in clinical practice."

  "abstract": "Background: Neck pain (NP) is common in all age groups and adversely affects the patients' entire lifestyle. There exists inconclusive evidence relating faulty craniocervical posture with pain-related disability. This review aims to determine whether sagittal head and neck posture differs in NP and pain-free subjects, to critically appraise the correlation of posture with NP.\nMethods: Of 3796 articles identified at primary search from CINAHL, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, 26 were included based on eligibility criteria. Mean pooled difference (MPD) and effect size (ES) were calculated to establish relationship among studies, to assess postural correlation with NP measures [Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), neck disability index (NDI), Northwick Park NP Questionnaire (NPQ)] and for age- and gender-wise variation. Risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.\nResults: Craniovertebral angle (CVA) had a significant MPD of - 2.93(95% CI - 4.95 to - 0.91). Sagittal head angle (SHA) and forward head posture (FHP) had an insignificant MPD of 1.15 (95% CI - 1.16 to 3.46) and - 0.26 (95% CI - 1.89 to 1.36), respectively. Age- and gender-wise CVA difference was found to be 2.36° and 2.57°, respectively. ES was significant for correlation between CVA and pain intensity [NPRS: - 0.44 (95% CI - 0.61 to - 0.26); VAS: - 0.31 (95% CI - 0.46 to - 0.16)], and between CVA and disability [NDI: - 0.18 (95% CI - 0.31 to - 0.05); NPQ: - 0.47 (95% CI - 0.61 to - 0.320)].\nConclusion: CVA differs for age, gender, and pain vs pain-free subjects, and correlates negatively with NP measures. Other surrogate measures (SHA, cranial and cervical angles, FHP) warrant further research.\nProspero registration: PROSPERO 2021 CRD42021275485."

  "title": "Āsana for Neck, Shoulders, and Wrists to Prevent Musculoskeletal Disorders among Dental Professionals: In-Office Yóga Protocol",
  "date": "2023 Feb 20",
  "abstract": "Extensive literature reports an increase in physical disorders (pain, pathologies, dysfunctions) and mental malaise/uneasiness (stress, burnout) affecting dental professionals in relation to fast and pressing rhythms of work, long working hours, increasingly demanding patients, ever-evolving technologies, etc. This project has been conceived to bring the science of yoga around the world to dental professionals as a preventive (occupational) medicine and to provide knowledge and means for self-care. Yoga is a concentrative self-discipline of the mind, senses, and physical body, that requires regular daily exercise (or meditation), attention, intention, and disciplined action. M&M: The study aimed to design a Yoga protocol specifically devised for dental professionals (dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants) including positions (āsana) to be practiced/used in the dental office. The protocol is targeted for the upper body, namely neck, upper back, chest, shoulder girdle, and wrists, being areas greatly affected by work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This paper represents a yoga-based guideline for the self-cure of musculoskeletal disorders among dental professionals. Results: The protocol includes both sitting (Upavistha position) and standing (Utthana or Sama position) āsana, with twisting (Parivrtta), side bending (Parsva), flexion and forward bending (Pashima), and extension and arching (Purva) āsana to mobilize and decompress, and to provide nourishment and oxygen to the musculo-articular system. The paper delivers different concepts and theories developed and deepened by the authors and introduces and spreads yoga as a medical science among dental professionals for the prevention and treatment of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. We articulate notions ranging from stretching out using the vinyāsa method (breath-driven movement) and inward-focused attention to contemplative/concentrative science, interoceptive attention, self-awareness, the mind-body connection, and receptive attitude. The theory of \"muscles are bone ties\" is coined and delivered with regard to tensegrity musculoskeletal fascial structures connecting, pulling together, and nearing the bone segments where they are anchored. The paper describes over 60 āsana envisaged to be performed on dental stools or using the walls of a dental office or a dental unit chair. A detailed guideline on the work-related disorders that can find relief with the protocol is provided, including the description of breath control for the practice of āsana in vinyāsa. The foundations of the technique reside in the IyengarYoga method and ParināmaYoga method. Conclusions: This paper represents a guideline for self-cure in the prevention or treatment of musculoskeletal disorders affecting dental professionals. Yoga is a powerful concentrative self-discipline able to provide physical and mental well-being, representing great help and support in daily life and business for dental professionals. Yógāsana restores retracted and stiff muscles, giving relief to the strained and tired limbs of dental professionals. Yoga is not intended for flexible or physically performing persons but for people who decide to take care of themselves. The practice of specific āsana represents a powerful tool for the prevention or treatment of MSDs related to poor posture, forward head, chronic neck tension (and related headache), depressed chest, compressive disorders on wrists and shoulders as carpal tunnel, impingement syndromes, outlet syndrome, subacromial pain syndrome and spinal disc pathologies. Yoga, as an integrative science in medicine and public health, represents a powerful tool for the prevention and treatment of occupational musculoskeletal disorders and an extraordinary path for the self-care of dental professionals, sitting job workers, and healthcare providers suffering from occupational biomechanical stresses and awkward postures."

  "date": "2023 Feb 14",
  "abstract": "Prolonged computer use and poor ergonomics among IT professionals are considered risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. This research aims to analyze the degree of forward head posture and workplace ergonomics in young IT professionals to assess the risk for a neck disability. Methods: A prospective study was carried out by assessing the sitting posture at work, neck disability in the cervical region, quality of life, physical activity, and ergonomics of the workspace in 73 young IT professionals (32.56±5.46 years). Results: The score for the cervical functional disability index (NDI) showed a mild neck disability (8.19±7.51). The craniovertebral angle has an average value of 32.01±11.46, corresponding to a light forward head posture, and it positively correlated with age and work experience and negatively correlated with ROSA (r=0.24, p<0.05). The NDI positively correlated with physical activity (r =00.32 p<0.05) and with ROSA (r= 0.24, p<0.05). Conclusions: In IT professionals, neck disability is associated with the lack of workspace ergonomics and the amount of physical activity. Forward head posture correlated with age, work experience, and poor workspace ergonomics. According to our findings, there are real concerns about the influence of head posture and workplace ergonomics on health among IT professionals. We consider that it is necessary to adopt preventive measures to address neck disability and improve workspace ergonomics."

  "title": "Do Temporomandibular Disorder Patients with Joint Pain Exhibit Forward Head Posture? A Cephalometric Study",
  "date": "2023 Feb 2",
  "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate head and cervical posture in individuals with or without temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and to assess the correlations between pain, severity of symptoms, and posture.\nMethods: A total of 384 patients (129 males and 255 females) was included. The Fonseca Anamnestic Index (FAI) was used to assess the severity and prevalence of TMD and the presence of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain. Patients were divided into three groups: the TMD-free group, TMD without TMJ pain group, and TMD with TMJ pain group. Subsequently, the patients with TMJ pain were further divided into mild TMD and moderate/severe TMD groups. Nine parameters were traced on cephalograms to characterize the head and cervical posture.\nResults: TMD patients with TMJ pain showed increased forward head posture (FHP) than patients without TMJ pain and TMD-free subjects. No significant difference was observed between the TMD patients without TMJ pain and TMD-free subjects. In the TMD patients with the TMJ pain group, the moderate/severe TMD patients demonstrated increased FHP compared to mild TMD patients. TMD patients with joint pain had greater CVT/RL (B = 3.099), OPT/RL (B = 2.117), and NSL/C2' (B = 4.646) than the patients without joint pain after adjusting for confounding variables (P < 0.05).\nConclusion: TMD patients with TMJ pain showed increased FHP compared to other groups, and FHP became more significant as TMD severity increased in male patients, indicating the FHP might play an important role in the development of TMJ pain. In the clinical assessment of TMD, the patients' abnormal head and cervical posture might be considered."

  "title": "Head Impact Location, Speed and Angle from Falls and Trips in the Workplace",
  "date": "2023 Feb 6.",
  "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common injury in the workplace. Trips and falls are the leading causes of TBI in the workplace. However, industrial safety helmets are not designed for protecting the head under these impact conditions. Instead, they are designed to pass the regulatory standards which test head protection against falling heavy and sharp objects. This is likely to be due to the limited understanding of head impact conditions from trips and falls in workplace. In this study, we used validated human multi-body models to predict the head impact location, speed and angle (measured from the ground) during trips, forward falls and backward falls. We studied the effects of worker size, initial posture, walking speed, width and height of the tripping barrier, bracing and falling height on the head impact conditions. Overall, we performed 1692 simulations. The head impact speed was over two folds larger in falls than trips, with backward falls producing highest impact speeds. However, the trips produced impacts with smaller impact angles to the ground. Increasing the walking speed increased the head impact speed but bracing reduced it. We found that 41% of backward falls and 19% of trips/forward falls produced head impacts located outside the region of helmet coverage. Next, we grouped all the data into three sub-groups based on the head impact angle: [0°, 30°], (30°, 60°] and (60°, 90°] and excluded groups with small number of cases. We found that most trips and forward falls lead to impact angles within the (30°, 60°] and (60°, 90°] groups while all backward falls produced impact angles within (60°, 90°] group. We therefore determined five representative head impact conditions from these groups by selecting the 75th percentile speed, mean value of angle intervals and median impact location (determined by elevation and azimuth angles) of each group. This led to two representative head impact conditions for trips: 2.7 m/s at 45° and 3.9 m/s at 75°, two for forward falls: 3.8 m/s at 45° and 5.5 m/s at 75° and one for backward falls: 9.4 m/s at 75°. These impact conditions can be used to improve industrial helmet standards."

  "title": "Relationships between cervical sagittal posture, muscle endurance, joint position sense, range of motion and level of smartphone addiction",
  "date": "2023 Jan 23",
  "abstract": "Background: Frequent smartphone use in a pathological way forces the user to adopt a compromised posture. This gradually results in changes to both the postural and musculoskeletal systems. This study's objectives were evaluation of head posture, muscle endurance, neck range of motion (ROM) and joint position sense in two separate smartphone user groups, one 'Addicted', the other 'Non-Addicted'.\nMethods: A sample of convenience (n = 60) was recruited from medical students (age 24.57 ± 4.38, 53.3% male) with a history of smartphones use > 2 h/day for 1-year. Based on the cut-off values of the smartphone addiction scale-short version (SAS-SV), participants were entered into each group (cut-off for male ≥ 31, female ≥ 33). Neck muscle endurance time, joint position error and cervical ROM, along with forward head posture parameters of craniovertebral angle (CVA), shoulder angle (SA), sagittal head angle (SHA) and forward head distance (FHD)) were evaluated. A Mann-Whitney test and Spearman correlation coefficient were used to determine the difference between groups and the correlations between variables.\nResults: The difference between 'Addicted' and 'Non-Addicted' groups was confirmed by the values for SAS-SV scores (25.23 ± 5.5 versus 43.9 ± 6.61) (p < 0.001). There were statistically significant differences between groups for the CVA and FHD parameters (p < 0.001). Further, the neck extensor muscle endurance (97 ± 3.79 versus 74.86 ± 2.23 s), was significantly different between groups (p = 0.010) but not after Bonferroni correction. There was no notable difference in the neck flexor muscle endurance, joint position error, SA, and SHA parameters between groups (p > 0.05).\nConclusions: There is a positive correlation between smartphone addiction and both decreased extensor muscle endurance and changes in neck postural alignment."

  "title": "A Comparison of Two Forward Head Posture Corrective Approaches in Elderly with Chronic Non-Specific Neck Pain: A Randomized Controlled Study",
  "date": "2023 Jan 9",
  "abstract": "Forward head posture (FHP) is a common postural displacement that is significantly associated with neck pain, with higher risks of having neck pain in female and older populations. This study investigated the effect of two different forward head posture (FHP) interventions in elderly participants with poor posture and non-specific neck pain. Sixty-six elderly participants with a craniovertebral angle (CVA) < 50° were randomized into either a Chiropractic Biophyics® (CBP®) or a standardized exercise based FHP correction group (Standard Group). Both groups were treated for 18 sessions over a 6-week period. A 3-month post-treatment follow-up was also assessed with no further interventions. The CBP group received a mirror image® exercise and a Denneroll™ cervical traction orthotic (DCTO); the standard group performed a protocol of commonly used stretching and strengthening exercises for the neck. Both groups received 30 min of their respective interventions per session. The primary outcome was the CVA, with secondary outcomes including pain intensity, Berg balance score (BBS), head repositioning accuracy (HRA), and cervical range of motion (CROM). After 18 sessions (6 weeks later), the CBP group had statistically significant improvement in the CVA (p < 0.001), whereas the standard group did not. In contrast, both groups showed improved functional measurements on the BBS and HRA as well as improved pain intensity. However, at the 3-month follow-up (with no further treatment), there were statistically significant differences favoring the CBP group for all outcomes (p < 0.001). The differences in the between group outcomes at the 3-month follow-up indicated that the improved outcomes were maintained in the CBP group, while the standard group experienced regression of the initially improved outcomes at 6 weeks. It is suggested that the improvement in the postural CVA (in the CBP group but not in the standard group) is the driver of superior and maintained pain and functional outcomes."

  "title": "Effect of Active Muscles on Astronaut Kinematics and Injury Risk for Piloted Lunar Landing and Launch While Standing",
  "date": "2023 Jul",
  "abstract": "While astronauts may pilot future lunar landers in a standing posture, the response of the human body under lunar launch and landing-related dynamic loading conditions is not well understood. It is important to consider the effects of active muscles under these loading conditions as muscles stabilize posture while standing. In the present study, astronaut response for a piloted lunar mission in a standing posture was simulated using an active human body model (HBM) with a closed-loop joint-angle based proportional integral derivative controller muscle activation strategy and compared with a passive HBM to understand the effects of active muscles on astronaut body kinematics and injury risk. While head, neck, and lumbar spine injury risk were relatively unaffected by active muscles, the lower extremity injury risk and the head and arm kinematics were significantly changed. Active muscle prevented knee-buckling and spinal slouching and lowered tibia injury risk in the active vs. passive model (revised tibia index: 0.02-0.40 vs. 0.01-0.58; acceptable tolerance: 0.43). Head displacement was higher in the active vs. passive model (11.6 vs. 9.0 cm forward, 6.3 vs. 7.0 cm backward, 7.9 vs. 7.3 cm downward, 3.7 vs. 2.4 cm lateral). Lower arm movement was seen with the active vs. passive model (23 vs. 35 cm backward, 12 vs. 20 cm downward). Overall simulations suggest that the passive model may overpredict injury risk in astronauts for spaceflight loading conditions, which can be improved using the model with active musculature."

  "title": "Assessment of thoracic spinal curvatures in static postures using spatially tracked 3D ultrasound volumes: a proof-of-concept study",
  "date": "2023 Mar",
  "abstract": "The assessment of spinal posture is a difficult endeavour given the lack of identifiable bony landmarks for placement of skin markers. Moreover, potentially significant soft tissue artefacts along the spine further affect the accuracy of marker-based approaches. The objective of this proof-of-concept study was to develop an experimental framework to assess spinal postures by using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) imaging. A phantom spine model immersed in water was scanned using 3D US in a neutral and two curved postures mimicking a forward flexion in the sagittal plane while the US probe was localised by three electromagnetic tracking sensors attached to the probe head. The obtained anatomical 'coarse' registrations were further refined using an automatic registration algorithm and validated by an experienced sonographer. Spinal landmarks were selected in the US images and validated against magnetic resonance imaging data of the same phantom through image registration. Their position was then related to the location of the tracking sensors identified in the acquired US volumes, enabling the localisation of landmarks in the global coordinate system of the tracking device. Results of this study show that localised 3D US enables US-based anatomical reconstructions comparable to clinical standards and the identification of spinal landmarks in different postures of the spine. The accuracy in sensor identification was 0.49 mm on average while the intra- and inter-observer reliability in sensor identification was strongly correlated with a maximum deviation of 0.8 mm. Mapping of landmarks had a small relative distance error of 0.21 mm (SD = ± 0.16) on average. This study implies that localised 3D US holds the potential for the assessment of full spinal posture by accurately and non-invasively localising vertebrae in space."

  "date": "2023 Jan-Mar",
  "abstract": "Introduction: The US military is transitioning into a posture preparing for large-scale combat operations in which delays in evacuation may become common. It remains unclear which casualty population can have their initial surgical interventions delayed, thus reducing the evacuation demands.\nMethods: We performed a secondary analysis of a previously described dataset from the Department of Defense Trauma Registry (DODTR) focused on casualties who received prehospital care. In this, we sought to determine (1) of those who underwent operative intervention, the proportion of surgeries occurring ≥3 days post-injury, and (2) of those who underwent early versus delayed surgery, the proportions who required blood products.\nResults: There were 6,558 US military casualties who underwent surgical intervention-6,224 early (less than 3 days from injury) and 333 delayed (≥ 3 days from injury). The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was higher in the early cohort (10 versus 6, p is less than 0.001). Serious injuries to the head were more common in the early cohort (12% versus 5%, p is less than 0.001), as were the thorax (13% versus 9%, p=0.041), abdomen (10% versus 5%, p=0.001), extremities (37% versus 14%, p is less than 0.001), and skin (4% versus less than 1%, p=0.001). Survival to discharge was lower in the early cohort (97% versus 100%, p is less than 0.001). Mean whole blood consumption was higher in the early cohort (0.5 versus 0 units, p is less than 0.001), as was packed red blood cells (6.3 versus 0.5, p is less than 0.001), platelets (0.9 versus 0, p is less than 0.001), and fresh frozen plasma (4.5 versus 0.2, p is less than 0.001). The administration of any units of packed red blood cells and whole blood was higher for the early cohort (37% versus 7%, p is less than 0.001), as was a ≥3 units threshold (30% versus 3%, p is less than 0.001), and ≥10 units threshold (18% versus 1%, p is less than 0.001).\nConclusions: Few combat casualties underwent delayed surgical interventions defined as ≥3 days post injury, and only a small number of casualties with delayed surgical intervention received blood products. Casualties who received early surgical intervention were more likely to have higher injury severity scores, and more likely to receive blood."

  "date": "2022 Dec 8",
  "abstract": "Under certain conditions, a tactile stimulus to the head induces the movement of the head away from the stimulus, and this is thought to be caused by a defense mechanism. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that predicting the stimulus site of the head in a quiet stance activates the defense mechanism, causing a body to sway to keep the head away from the stimulus. Fourteen healthy male participants aged 31.2 ± 6.8 years participated in this study. A visual cue predicting the forthcoming stimulus site (forehead, left side of the head, right side of the head, or back of the head) was given. Four seconds after this cue, an auditory or electrical tactile stimulus was given at the site predicted by the cue. The cue predicting the tactile stimulus site of the head did not induce a body sway. The cue predicting the auditory stimulus to the back of the head induced a forward body sway, and the cue predicting the stimulus to the forehead induced a backward body sway. The cue predicting the auditory stimulus to the left side of the head induced a rightward body sway, and the cue predicting the stimulus to the right side of the head induced a leftward body sway. These findings support our hypothesis that predicting the auditory stimulus site of the head induces a body sway in a quiet stance to keep the head away from the stimulus. The right gastrocnemius muscle contributes to the control of the body sway in the anterior-posterior axis related to this defense mechanism."

  "abstract": "Dizziness or vertigo can be caused by dysfunction of the vestibular or non-vestibular systems. The diagnosis, treatment, and mechanism of dizziness or vertigo caused by vestibular dysfunction have been described in detail. However, dizziness by the non-vestibular system, especially cervicogenic dizziness, is not well known. This paper explained the cervicogenic dizziness caused by abnormal sensory input with references to several studies. Among head and neck muscles, suboccipital muscles act as stabilizers and controllers of the head. Structural and functional changes of the suboccipital muscles can induce dizziness. Especially, myodural bridges and activation of trigger point stimulated by abnormal head posture may be associated with cervicogenic dizziness."

This study aimed to examine the effects of a combined exercise program on the spinal curvature and balance ability in adolescents with kyphosis. Fifty-one adolescents (mean age 21.95 ± 3.90 year, 23 male and 28 female) diagnosed with kyphosis were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (n = 25) and a control group (n = 26). All participants in the study group underwent a combined exercise program for 60 min, three times per week, for 12 weeks. Cobb’s angle and forward head angle showed significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.001). The anterior and posterior weight distributions of static and dynamic plantar foot pressures showed a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.001), and significant differences were observed only in the study group (p < 0.001). However, the left and right static plantar foot pressures did not differ significantly. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that a combined exercise program is an effective intervention for the improvement of alignment in the spinal curve and balance in adolescents with postural kyphosis."

  "date": "2022 Dec 5",
  "abstract": "Background: falls are common in older adults, and any fall from standing height onto a rigid surface has the potential to cause a serious brain injury or bone fracture. Safe strategies for falling in humans have traditionally been difficult to study.\nObjective: to determine whether specific 'safe landing' strategies (body rotation during descent, and upper limb bracing) separate injurious and non-injurious falls in seniors.\nDesign: observational cohort study.\nSetting: two long-term care homes in Vancouver BC.\nMethods: videos of 2,388 falls experienced by 658 participants (mean age 84.0 years; SD 8.1) were analysed with a structured questionnaire. General estimating equations were used to examine how safe landing strategies associated with documented injuries.\nResults: injuries occurred in 38% of falls, and 4% of falls caused injuries treated in hospitals. 32% of injuries were to the head. Rotation during descent was common and protective against injury. In 43% of falls initially directed forward, participants rotated to land sideways, which reduced their odds for head injury 2-fold. Upper limb bracing was used in 58% of falls, but rather than protective, bracing was associated with an increased odds for injury, possibly because it occurred more often in the demanding scenario of forward landings.\nConclusions: the risk for injury during falls in long-term care was reduced by rotation during descent, but not by upper limb bracing. Our results expand our understanding of human postural responses to falls, and point towards novel strategies to prevent fall-related injuries."

  "date": "2023 Feb",
  "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is a valuable tool for simulating dangerous situations and training under these conditions with a reduced possibility of injury. This could be beneficial within different sports scenarios. In gymnastics, the height of the balance beam can be dangerous and frightening, especially for beginners. Here, a simulated height can reduce the participant's risk of injury and facilitate entry to balance beam gymnastics. However, the investigation of sports performance in a virtual environment is rare. Therefore, the current study aims to compare beginners' performance in balance beam tasks between the real world (RW) and VR. 34 sports students executed gymnastic balancing forward, backward and the extension of one leg to the front, the side and the back on a regular balance beam in the RW and on a balance beam with simulated height in VR (using a head-mounted display). We analyzed beginners' performance in both conditions (RW and VR) regarding different criteria for each balance beam task. Statistical analyses show significant differences in performance with better results in RW (p < .05). Especially the body tension and the upper body posture were superior in RW. One explanation can be the more difficult regulation of the balance in VR. For the tasks where the motion took part in a fixed position on the beam, the further performance aspects were similar for RW and VR. When the participants moved along the beam, further performance aspects, like the leg extension, were better in RW. In total, the participants executed the VR balance beam tasks with decreased danger of injury due to the simulated height of the balance beam, but their performance was slightly limited. We conclude that for the first contact with the height of a balance beam, VR is a suitable tool to reduce the danger of injury occurring from falling off the beam and facilitate entry to balance beam gymnastics."

  "date": "2023 Jan",
  "abstract": "When a row of objects surrounded by a frame suddenly shifts a certain distance so that part of the row is occluded by the frame, humans perceive ambiguous apparent motion either to the left or the right. However, when the objects have \"directionality,\" humans perceive them as moving forward in the direction in which they are pointing, which is termed forward-facing motion bias. In the present study, five experiments were conducted to address whether, and if so how, physical properties or prior knowledge about the objects affected the perception of their apparent motion in two juvenile chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In experiment 1, the chimpanzees did not show a clear forward-facing bias in judging the direction of motion when directed triangles were presented, whereas the human participants did. In contrast, when pictures of the lateral view of chimpanzees with quadrupedal postures were shown, there was a clear bias for going \"forward\" with regards to the side with the head (experiment 2). We presented pictures of dogs looking back to explore what features caused the forward-facing motion bias (experiment 3). Chimpanzees did not show any bias for these stimuli, suggesting that the direction of the head and body interactively affected the perceptual bias. Experiment 4 tested the role of the head and found that only the lateral view of the heads of chimpanzees or humans caused the bias (experiment 4). Additional tests also showed that the chimpanzees could not solve the task based only on the direction of the stimuli without motion (experiment 5). These results indicate that the perception of motion in the chimpanzees was affected by the biological features of the stimuli, suggesting their prior knowledge of the \"body\" from a biological (morphological and kinetic) perspective."

  "abstract": "Distal junctional kyphosis (DJK) is defined as the development of a kyphotic angulation over 10 degrees below a fusion construct and has been described as a complication of the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, Scheuermann kyphosis, adult spinal deformity, and cervical deformity. There are some inherent risk factors to DJK: multilevel fusions, damage to the midline soft tissues including interspinous/supraspinous ligaments, T5-T12 thoracic kyphosis, T11-L2 thoracolumbar kyphosis, and increased mismatch between cervical lordosis and T1 slope. A 53-year-old male presented with cervicalgia, inability to sustain horizontal gaze, and kyphosis-enabled forward head posture. He underwent C3-T1 posterior decompression and fusion as treatment for cervical myelopathy 18 months prior. Neurologic examination was normal, with appreciable protrusion of the T1 vertebral spinous process. Surgery was initiated through subperiosteal exposure of C2-T6, followed by removal of previously set instrumentation, placement of new screws, and posterior column osteotomies of selected segments. Final steps involved compression across excised portions, locking pedicle screws, and a multirod insertion after closure of the posterior column osteotomies by compression maneuvers. Correction for DJK encompasses sagittal alignment restoration, a stable construct, and a good biological environment for healing. Failure of DJK realignment can occur if the patient's ligaments deteriorate distal to the construct or fractures develop in vertebral bodies at the lowest instrumented vertebra or lowest instrumented vertebra +1. One year after surgery, the patient's condition improved, evidenced from both patient self-report and a standing posture radiograph."

  "abstract": "The ability to control head orientation relative to the body is a multisensory process that mainly depends on proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual sensory systems. A system to study the sensory integration of head orientation was developed and tested. A test seat with a five-point harness was assembled to provide passive postural support. A lightweight head-mounted display was designed for mounting multiaxis accelerometers and a mini-CCD camera to provide the visual input to virtual reality goggles with a 39° horizontal field of view. A digitally generated sinusoidal signal was delivered to a motor-driven computer-controlled sled on a 6-m linear railing system. A data acquisition system was designed to collect acceleration data. A pilot study was conducted to test the system. Four young, healthy subjects were seated with their trunks fixed to the seat. The subjects received a sinusoidal anterior-posterior translation with peak accelerations of 0.06g at 0.1 Hz and 0.12g at 0.2, 0.5, and 1.1 Hz. Four sets of visual conditions were randomly presented along with the translation. These conditions included eyes open, looking forward, backward, and sideways, and also eyes closed. Linear acceleration data were collected from linear accelerometers placed on the head, trunk, and seat and were processed using MATLAB. The head motion was analyzed using fast Fourier transform to derive the gain and phase of head pitch acceleration relative to seat linear acceleration. A randomization test for two independent variables tested the significance of visual and inertial effects on response gain and phase shifts. Results show that the gain was close to one, with no significant difference among visual conditions across frequencies. The phase was shown to be dependent on the head strategy each subject used."

  "abstract": "Forward head posture (FHP) is a serious problem causing head and neck disability, but the characteristics of muscle activity during long-term postural maintenance are unclear. This study aimed to investigate a comparison of electromyography (EMG) activation properties and subjective fatigue between young adults with and without habitual FHP. In this study, we examined the changes in the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of muscle activity using high-density surface EMG (HD-SEMG) in addition to mean frequency, a conventional measure of muscle fatigue. Nineteen male participants were included in the study (FHP group (n = 9; age = 22.3 ± 1.5 years) and normal group (n = 10; age = 22.5 ± 1.4 years)). Participants held three head positions (e.g., forward, backward, and neutral positions) for a total of 30 min each, and the EMG activity of the trapezius pars descendens muscle during posture maintenance was measured by HD-SEMG. The root mean square (RMS), the modified entropy, and the correlation coefficient were calculated. Additionally, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was evaluated to assess subjective fatigue. The RMS, VAS, modified entropy, and correlation coefficients were significantly higher in the FHP group than in the normal group (p < 0.001). With increasing postural maintenance time, the modified entropy and correlation coefficient values significantly decreased, and the mean frequency and VAS values significantly increased (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the forward position had significantly higher RMS, correlation coefficient, modified entropy, and VAS values than in the neutral position (p < 0.001). The HD-SEMG potential distribution patterns in the FHP group showed less heterogeneity and greater muscle activity in the entire muscle and subjective fatigue than those in the normal group. Excess muscle activity even in the neutral/comfortable position in the FHP group could potentially be a mechanism of neuromuscular conditions in this population."

  "abstract": "The forward head posture of visual display terminal (VDT) users induces various physical and cognitive clinical symptoms. However, few studies have been conducted to identify and solve problems associated with VDT posture. This study aimed to examine the adverse effects of VDT posture and the positive effects of traction-combined workstations by measuring postural alignment, muscle properties, blood velocity, preference, and working memory. Thirty-four healthy VDT users (18 males and 16 females aged 20-30 years) participated in the experiment at three workstations, including conventional (VDT_C), head support (VDT_S), and upright (VDT_U) workstations. They conducted 2-back working memory task. The craniovertebral angle (CVA), muscle tone and stiffness, blood velocity and visual analogue discomfort scale (VADS) were measured to examine the influence of workstations. VDT_C showed increased muscle tone or stiffness in the levator scapulae (LS), suboccipital muscle (SM), and sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) and an increased reaction time (RT) in working memory. However, VDT_S showed decreased stiffness and tone of SM and improved comfort. In addition, VDT_U showed decreased stiffness or tone of the LS and SCM and improved blood velocity and RT. In conclusion, maintaining neutral alignment significantly improved working memory performance, muscle properties, and blood velocity."

  "title": "Driving Behavior during Takeover Request of Autonomous Vehicle: Effect of Driver Postures",
  "date": "2022 Oct 28",
  "abstract": "We investigated the effect of driver posture on driving control following a takeover request (TOR) from autonomous to manual driving in level 3 autonomous vehicles. When providing a TOR, driving behaviors need to be investigated to develop driver monitoring systems, and it is important to clarify the effect of driver postures. Experiments were conducted using driver postures that are likely to be adopted in autonomous driving. Driver postures were set based on combinations of two types of upper-body posture and three types of foot posture. The driver's upper body and head were set to either a forward or sideways orientation. For each of these there were three types of foot posture: both feet on the floor, crossed legs, and cross-legged sitting. Following a TOR, we compared the braking and steering maneuvers of subjects driving normally and examined the effects of posture on driver reaction time. The results show that both the upper-body and foot postures of the driver affect the steering and braking reaction time. The driver monitoring system should be able to detect posture and activate a TOR warning, and detection times up to 2 and 1.3 times faster than those for normal postures should be considered for different upper-body and foot postures, respectively."

  "title": "Severity of slouched posture during smartphone use is associated with the musculoskeletal discomfort, daily usage, and school year among adolescents",
  "date": "2023 Sep",
  "abstract": "Real-time measurement of the craniovertebral, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis angles during natural and smartphone usage postures in sitting were analysed in a cohort of 560 adolescents using independent t-tests and Spearman's correlations between their reported musculoskeletal symptoms, daily device use and school year. Students with musculoskeletal symptoms (mean difference: 4.1-9.4°, p < .001) and in secondary schools (mean difference: 13.6-29.4°, p < .001) had a greater forward-head posture quantified by craniovertebral angle in both postures. Loss of lumbar lordosis was found in students spending ≥2 h/day on electronic devices (mean difference: 3.2°, p = .029) and those with musculoskeletal symptoms (mean difference: 5.4°, p = .001). Secondary school students exhibited a greater thoracic kyphosis when using smartphones (mean difference: 3.3°, p = .003). Findings suggest the urgent need for early and proactive intervention targeted to minimise the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders related to intense device use for young adolescents.Practitioner Summary: Adolescents: (1) in higher school year had increased forward-head posture (FHP) and thoracic kyphosis; (2) with musculoskeletal symptoms had increased FHP and loss of lumbar lordosis, and; (3) with extended device use had a loss of lumbar lordosis. Early intervention targeting young adolescents promoting optimal posture and habit of device use is warranted."

  "date": "2023 May",
  "abstract": "Astronauts may pilot a future lunar lander in a standing or upright/reclined seated posture. This study compared kinematics and injury risk for the upright/reclined (30°; 60°) seated vs. standing postures for lunar launch/landing using human body modeling across 30 simulations. While head metrics for standing and upright seated postures were comparable to 30 cm height jumps, those of reclined postures were closer to 60 cm height jumps. Head linear acceleration for 60° reclined posture in the 5 g/10 ms pulse exceeded NASA's tolerance (10.1 g; tolerance: 10 g). Lower extremity metrics exceeding NASA's tolerance in the standing posture (revised tibia index: 0.36-0.53; tolerance: 0.43) were lowered in seated postures (0.00-0.04). Head displacement was higher in standing vs. seated (9.0 cm vs. 2.4 cm forward, 7.0 cm vs. 1.3 cm backward, 2.1 cm vs. 1.2 cm upward, 7.3 cm vs. 0.8 cm downward, 2.4 cm vs. 3.2 cm lateral). Higher arm movement was seen with seated vs. standing (40 cm vs. 25 cm forward, 60 cm vs. 15 cm upward, 30 cm vs. 20 cm downward). Pulse-nature contributed more than 40% to the injury metrics for seated postures compared to 80% in the standing posture. Seat recline angle contributed about 22% to the injury metrics in the seated posture. This study established a computational methodology to simulate the different postures of an astronaut for lunar landings and generated baseline injury risk and body kinematics data."

[Methods] The CBP Non-profit website as well as PubMed and Index to Chiropractic literature were searched for case reports/series documenting the increase of cervical lordosis and improvement of forward head posture in the treatment of various craniocervical spinal disorders by CBP technique methods. [Results] Sixty patients were reported in 41 unique manuscripts detailing the improvement in cervical spine alignment by CBP technique methods. On average, there was a 14° improvement in cervical lordosis and a 12 mm reduction in forward head position after 40 treatments over 16 weeks with a 5-point reduction in pain rating scores. Thirty-eight percent of cases included follow-up showing only slight loss of lordosis, but maintenance of pain and disability improvements after an average of 1.5 treatments per month for 1.8 years. [Conclusion] An abundance of reports document improvement in craniocervical and other ailments by CBP methods that increase cervical lordosis. Routine radiographic imaging of the spine is recommended as it is safe and the only current practical method of screening for critical biomechanical biomarkers of sagittal spine alignment."

  "abstract": "Purpose: Balance performance can be measured with a computerized dynamic posturography (CDP). Frequently used CDP protocols include the sensory organization test (SOT), motor control test (MCT) and adaptation test (ADT). The primary aim of this study was to produce normative data using the Bertec® Balance Advantage CDP on a cohort of healthy adults aged 20-79 years for the SOT, MCT and ADT. The secondary aim was to determine age- and gender-related differences.\nMethods: The study population of 120 participants were divided into age groups of 20-29, 30-39 years, etc., with an equal number of men and women in each group. Using the Bertec® CDP, the SOT, MCT and ADT protocols were performed.\nResults: SOT found that the 70-79 age group and men scored lower equilibrium scores (ES) on SOT4, and SOT6. Women had higher ES on SOT1. For the MCT, backward translation. latencies were higher for the 60 s and 70 s age groups. The 60 s age group had higher forward translation latencies. Women had lower latencies on all MCTs. For the ADT toes up test, the 70-79 age group scored higher sway energy. On the toes down test, higher sway energy was registered for the 50-79 age groups. Women had lower sway energy for both ADT's.\nConclusion: We have produced normative data for healthy adults aged 20-79 years for the SOT, MCT and ADT protocols using the Bertec® Balance Advantage CDP. Balance performance differences might be due to decline in visual acuity, presbyvestibulopathy and differences in body composition."

  "title": "Effect of Forward Head Posture on Dynamic Balance Based on the Biodex Balance System",
  "date": "2022 Oct 1",
  "abstract": "Forward Head Posture (FHP) results in spine malalignment, muscle imbalance and cervical proprioception sensory input impairment. Subjective description of FHP is interpreted differently by clinicians and therefore the FHP is classified as slight, moderate and sever. This study aimed to evaluate balance disorder in individuals with severe forward head posture (FHP). Twenty individuals with severe FHP and 20 controls were enrolled. Dynamic postural stability was assessed in all participants using the Biodex Balance System (BBS) in semi dynamic position with eye open/eye closed conditions. Based on the findings, dynamic postural stability in the sagittal plane was different between the groups (P<0.05). It can be concluded that impairment of dynamic postural stability occurs in individuals with severe FHP. The findings suggest that clinicians take into account the importance of dynamic postural stability assessment in FHP subjects and consider the application of intervention programs for improvement of the dynamic balance."

  "date": "2022 Nov-Dec",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between nasal airway obstruction (NAO) and symptoms of orofacial pain, including temporomandibular joint pathology and primary headaches. This study was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients seeking care for chronic orofacial pain at 14 North American treatment centers. The standardized evaluation protocol followed for all patients included cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), a comprehensive clinical examination, and a thorough review of the patient's subjective complaints and health history, including pain and sleep pathology. The primary conditions of interest in this study were the following 5 types of NAO: nasal valve compromise (NVC), deviated septum, septal swell body, concha bullosa, and inferior turbinate soft tissue hypertrophy. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were performed to determine comorbidities between orofacial pain symptoms and NAO observed on CBCT images. The study population consisted of 1393 patients, 253 men (18.2%) and 1140 women (81.8%). The mean age of the patients was 43.3 (SD 18.1) years. NVC was the most prevalent type of NAO found in the study population (n = 1006; 72.2%). NVC showed a statistically significant comorbidity with capsulitis (odds ratio, 3.73) as well as facial and cervical myositis (odds ratio, 6.97). To the author's knowledge, this is first time that these comorbidities have been identified. NAO had a high comorbidity with orofacial pain. Specifically, NVC was a major contributor to NAO. An understanding of the mechanisms of orofacial pain as well as the effects of improper (mouth) breathing, adaptive forward head posture, muscular fatigue, parafunction, and temporomandibular joint pathology will help the clinician to evaluate the role a patient's nose may be playing in orofacial pain."

  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the effects of cervical stabilisation exercises on respiratory strength in chronic neck pain patients with forward head posture. The study was conducted from August 2020 to February 2021, at the Jinnah Hospital, Lahore; 44 patients who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to two groups-experimental group and control group-. Baseline measurement was taken for numeric pain rating scale, neck disability index, craniovertebral angle, single breath count, and spirometry and all the measurements were retaken at the completion of the fourth week. Results were not significant (p>0.05) before the treatment in both groups but post-intervention results revealed significant differences in both the groups (p<0.05), with the experimental group showing more improvement. Four weeks of cervical stabilisation with isometric exercises is more effective in the management of pain, forward head posture, neck disability and respiratory strength as compared with the four weeks of isometric exercises programme alone."

  "title": "The relationship between forward head posture, postural control and gait: A systematic review",
  "date": "2022 Oct",
  "abstract": "Background: Forward head posture (FHP) is a common postural deviation. An increasing number of studies have reported that people with FHP present with impaired postural control and gait; however, there is conflicting evidence. A systematic review focusing on these relationships has been unavailable to date.\nResearch question: Is there a relationship between FHP, postural control and gait?\nMethods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021231908). Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus (via EBSCO) were systematically searched, and a manual search was performed using the reference lists of included studies. Eligible studies included observational studies addressing the relationship between FHP, postural control and/or gait. Quality assessment was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Cross-Sectional Studies.\nResults: Nineteen studies were selected for this review. Consistent evidence supported that people with FHP had significant alterations in limits of stability (n = 3), performance-based balance (n = 3), and cervical proprioception (n = 4). Controversial evidence existed for a relationship of FHP with static balance (n = 4) and postural stability control (n = 4). Limited evidence existed to support an alteration in gait and vestibular function. Three studies on induced FHP consistently identified no reduced postural control.\nSignificance: Current evidence supports an association between FHP and a detrimental alteration in limits of stability, performance-based balance, and cervical proprioception. Instead of simply indicating impaired overall balance, the findings of this review indicate that a reduction in specific aspects of the postural control requires to be clarified in clinical evaluation for individuals with FHP, which would facilitate the planning and application of appropriate interventions to prevent dysfunctions and disability."

  "date": "2023 Jan",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Forward head posture (FHP) is common in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs); however, whether it contributes to TMD symptoms remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between (1) FHP and masticatory muscle pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) and (2) neck muscle and masticatory muscle PPTs.\nMaterials and methods: A total of 145 patients diagnosed with TMD were recruited between December 2020 and April 2021. Data regarding FHP and neck and masticatory muscle PPTs were collected. FHP was characterized by the craniocervical angle (CVA) measured between the horizontal line through C7 and the line between the tragus of the ear and C7. Patients were divided into either the FHP group (CVA ≤ 51°) or the non-FHP group. Differences in the masseter and temporalis muscle PPTs between the two groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between the CVA, neck, and masticatory muscle PPTs in all patients was determined by Spearman's correlation analysis.\nResults: There were 70 patients in the FHP group and 75 patients in the non-FHP group. No significant difference in masseter and temporalis muscle PPTs was found between the two groups (p > 0.05). No correlation was found between FHP and masticatory muscle PPTs (p > 0.05). A significant association was found between the neck muscle and masticatory muscle PPTs (p < 0.05). The C5-C6 pillar and masticatory PPTs were either moderately (r = 0.435, masseter muscle) or strongly (r = 0.608, temporalis muscle) correlated, while the correlation between the trapezius and masticatory muscles was moderate (r = 0.378, masseter muscle and r = 0.461, temporalis muscle).\nConclusion: FHP was not directly associated with masticatory muscle PPTs. Masticatory muscle PPTs were strongly or moderately associated with neck muscle PPTs. Therefore, the presence of neck pain, not the degree of FHP, in patients with TMD is of significance.\nClinical relevance: In TMD treatment, we should pay attention to and actively relieve neck pain."

  "abstract": "A randomized controlled study with a six-month follow-up was conducted to investigate the effects of sagittal head posture correction on 3D spinal posture parameters, back and leg pain, disability, and S1 nerve root function in patients with chronic discogenic lumbosacral radiculopathy (CDLR). Participants included 80 (35 female) patients between 40 and 55 years experiencing CDLR with a definite hypolordotic cervical spine and forward head posture (FHP) and were randomly assigned a comparative treatment control group and a study group. Both groups received TENS therapy and hot packs, additionally, the study group received the Denneroll cervical traction orthotic. Interventions were applied at a frequency of 3 x per week for 10 weeks and groups were followed for an additional 6-months. Radiographic measures included cervical lordosis (CL) from C2-C7 and FHP; postural measurements included: lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, trunk inclination, lateral deviation, trunk imbalance, surface rotation, and pelvic inclination. Leg and back pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and H-reflex latency and amplitude were measured. Statistically significant differences between the groups at 10 weeks were found: for all postural measures, CL (p = 0.001), AHT (p = 0.002), H-reflex amplitude (p = 0.007) and latency (p = 0.001). No significant difference for back pain (p = 0.2), leg pain (p = 0.1) and ODI (p = 0.6) at 10 weeks were identified. Only the study group's improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow up while the control groups values regressed back to baseline. At the 6-month follow-up, it was identified in the study group that improved cervical lordosis and reduction of FHP were found to have a positive impact on 3D posture parameters, leg and back pain scores, ODI, and H-reflex latency and amplitude."

  "abstract": "Purpose: The current investigation aimed to compare the sensorimotor integration, sensorimotor control, and cost of cognitive-motor dual task during walking, in persons with chronic WAD as compared to matched chronic idiopathic neck pain and normal healthy controls.\nMethods: A cross-sectional, case control design comparing 30 participants in each of two study groups (chronic WAD and chronic idiopathic neck pain) to a matched control group was conducted. Measurements included: (1) the cranio-vertebral angle (CVA), (2) left and right rotation head repositioning accuracy (HRA), (3) frontal N30 amplitudes to assess sensorimotor integration, (4) dual cognitive gait cost (DCGC).\nResults: A statistically significant difference for the CVA was found between groups: WAD 36.8° ± 3.4, chronic pain 44.5° ± 1.5, and controls 47.1° ± 4; p < 0.05. MANOVA revealed significant group differences for the N30 amplitude (p < 0.05), where the WAD group had the greatest amplitude. Statistically significant differences among the three groups were found for HRA left and right where the WAD group had the greatest error, (p < 0.05). Post hoc tests revealed that the WAD group had the highest dual-task cost during walking, (p < 0.05). Significant linear correlations between the CVA and N30 amplitude, HRA, and DCGC were identified in all 3 groups, (p < 0.05).\nConclusions: Compared to both a matched control group and chronic neck pain group, whiplash-injured persons have greater forward head posture, greater error in sensorimotor control, and an altered ability to perform a motor task with a simultaneous cognitive task."

The neck extensors and UT muscle activities of the participants were assessed in the upright, forward, and slouching postures by electromyography (EMG). In addition, neck proprioception and the performance of the cervical stabilizer muscles were evaluated using an inclinometer and biofeedback pressure unit, respectively.\nResults: A significant difference was observed between the cervical erector spine (CES) and UT muscle activities in the upright, forward, and slouching typing positions (P < 0.05). In addition, a difference was observed between the upright and slouching postures in these muscles. A positive correlation was denoted between CES muscle activity in the slouching and forward postures and the activation index of neck muscles (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant, negative correlation was observed between the UT muscle activity in the slouching posture and neck proprioception (P < 0.05). A positive correlation was also noted between the pain index and repositioning error rates (P < 0.05).\nConclusion: CES muscle activity increased in a forward head posture, which could damage neck proprioception through causing early fatigue and stimulating a cumulative damage cycle."

  "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the effect of music on visually impaired adolescents' postural balance across different somatosensory and vestibular input conditions. We recruited 19 adolescent participants (9 males, 10 females) with severe congenital visual impairment. We recorded their mean center of pressure velocity (CoPVm) during static upright bipedal standing under somatosensory (firm and foam surfaces) and vestibular (head facing forward (HFF), head rotated 90° to the right (HRR), and head rotated 90° to the left (HRL)) perturbations in three auditory conditions (no-music, listening to Jupiter, and listening to their preferred music). We found that CoPVm decreased significantly when listening to both Jupiter and preferred music, compared to the no-music condition on both firm (p < .05) and foam (p < .001) surfaces and with the HFF (p < .05), rotated to the right (p < .001) or rotated to the left (p < .001). Moreover, CoPVm values increased significantly with somatosensory manipulation (p < .001) in all the auditory conditions and with vestibular manipulation (p < .01) only in the no-music condition. We concluded that listening to both Jupiter and preferred music improved postural balance in visually impaired adolescents, even in challenged postural conditions."

  "abstract": "Purpose: Severe cervical axial deformity associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is rare in clinic, and there are little concerns about surgical treatment of axial deformity associated with AS. The case study aims to show the surgical technique to perform cervical rotational osteotomy.\nMethods: We present the case of a young AS patient whose neck was fixed in a left-rotational posture at 18°, requiring his trunk to be turned to the right to look forward visually. This made his gait appear to be limping, inconveniencing him with great difficulty. In order to correct this deformity, we performed a novel cervical rotational osteotomy through a one-stage posterior-anterior-posterior approach. Firstly, we performed laminectomies of C7 and T1, followed by a C7/T1 facetectomy with release of the bilateral C8 nerve roots. Next, we performed C7/T1 discectomy, bony resection of the lateral body and uncovertebral joints. The head of the patient was then rotated manually, so that both his face and torso were simultaneously facing frontward. Finally, rods spanning the screws from C6 to T2 were fixed.\nResults: Postoperatively, the patient's axial malalignment was significantly improved, and he was able to walk normally. Surgical outcomes were well maintained at a 3-year follow-up.\nConclusion: Through this case, we hope to draw the attention to spinal axial deformity and provide a reference point in the surgical treatment of spinal axial deformity."

  "date": "2022 Aug 18",
  "abstract": "A common cervical spine condition that frequently interferes with a patient's daily activities is chronic neck pain. The axioscapular muscle imbalance that results from increased middle trapezius activity in patients with non-specific chronic neck pain affects cervical spine stability and contributes to pain. A 67-year-old male, who was a retired office secretary, experienced neck pain for two years. In the last four months, his discomfort worsened, impairing his ability to function and degrading his quality of life. For the axioscapular muscle imbalance, scapular repositioning with a scapular belt was used to alleviate muscular imbalances and help with posture correction. The results were calculated using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and the Neck Disability Index (NDI), which revealed significant changes in pain intensity from 9 to 4, and disability scores shifted from 48% to 20% between the pre and post-treatment sessions, respectively. In order to decrease neck pain, this case report investigates the impact of scapular realignment using a scapular belt in the treatment of non-specific chronic neck discomfort."

  "date": "2022 Sep 1",
  "abstract": "Background: Dementia is becoming a relevant problem worldwide. A simple screening at an early stage will be important to detect the risk of developing dementia. Vestibular dysfunction is likely to be associated with cognitive impairment. Since head-mounted display (HMD) virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to activate the vestibular function, assessing postural sway with visual stimulation using HMD VR technology could be potentially useful for dementia screening.\nObjective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of HMD-based VR visual stimuli on posture in older adults and the relationship between the stimulated body sway behaviors and cognitive performance.\nMethod: Using a cross-sectional study design, we investigated the effect of an optokinetic design-based room with stripes (OKR) VR environment oscillating forwards and backwards at 23/60Hz. Center of pressure (COP) displacement was measured in older adults aged 65 years and over in the OKR VR environment. The frequency response of COP was compared to the cognitive performance of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\nResults: 20 healthy older adults (70.4 ± 4.9 years; 27.2 ± 1.6 MoCA score) and 3 people with mild cognitive impairment (74.7 ± 4.0 years; 20.3 ± 2.1 MoCA score) were assessed. The results reveal that the oscillating OKR VR environment induced different postural sway in the anterior-posterior direction in the real world. Correlation analysis shows that the cognitive test score was associated with the frequency response of stimulated postural sway in the anterior-posterior direction (frequency Band 1 of 0-0.5Hz related to the visual and vestibular systems: r s = 0.45, P = 0.03).\nConclusion: Outcomes would suggest that a potential link may emerge between cognition and posture when the HMD-based VR visual stimuli are applied. The simple screening of stimulated postural sway could explain cognitive functioning. Further studies are warranted to clarify the vestibular system and spatial cognitive function more specifically in the proposed assessment system."

  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effect of body posture on occlusal contact.\nMethods: A total of 30 healthy subjects were evaluated. T-Scan™ III was used to analyze the center of occlusal force (COF) and occlusal force distribution while subjects remained supine (SP), upright sitting with the head fixed (UP-HFI), upright sitting with the head free (UP-HFR), and natural standing (NS).\nResults: The total trajectory length of COF was significantly longer in NS than in SP, UP-HFI, and UP-HFR. The COF area was significantly larger in UP-HFR than in SP and UP-HFI and also significantly larger in NS than in SP, UP-HFI, and UP-HFR. The anteroposterior occlusal force distribution (AOD) in NS shifted significantly forward, compared to SP, UP-HFI, and UP-HFR. AOD in UP-HFI and UP-HFR shifted significantly forward, compared to the SP position.\nConclusion: Changes in body posture affect the stability and anteroposterior balance of occlusal contacts."

  "title": "Describing the Acoustic and Vocal Production Characteristics of the Irrintzi: Feasibility of Its Use for the Treatment of Voice Disorders",
  "date": "2022 Oct 17",
  "abstract": "Purpose: The aims of this study were to analyze and characterize the irrintzi (a folkloric shout emitted in a single breath used by the Basque people) acoustically and to describe the mechanism by which it is emitted.\nMethod: Thirty-six sound samples of 12 female volunteers were analyzed. Acoustic analysis included primarily fundamental frequency (f o), spectral analysis in the time domain with a narrowband filter, and the use of linear predictive coding (LPC). Laryngeal and pharyngeal movements while emitting an irrintzi were studied by fiberoptic nasal endoscopy. Postural and mandible movements were observed and video recorded. Movements of the larynx and the vocal tract were also studied by lateral pharyngo-laryngeal radioscopy.\nResults: The central part of an irrintzi spectrogram contains a peculiar, repeated M-shaped motif unseen in the spectrogram of any other human vocal emission, and intensity was over 90 dB SPL in all cases. f o was very high (1487 Hz) especially at the end of the irrintzi. Fiberoptic nasal endoscopy consistently revealed considerable elevation of the glottis, with the larynx swinging forward and retraction of the ventricular bands. Lateral radioscopy showed a very high larynx and a high tongue dorsum.\nConclusions: The irrintzi is a sound emitted in a single breath and characterized by its shrillness and loudness, qualities that make it audible in noisy environments and over large distances and the vocal technique observed when it is produced can be explained by the Estill voice model (Steinhauer et al., 2017). The use of this technique may help in the treatment of voice disorders and improve efficiency in singers, teachers, actors, and people who use their voice at high volume or at high frequency.\nSupplemental material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.20779405."

  "title": "Appraisal of the New Posture Analyzing and Virtual Reconstruction Device (PAViR) for Assessing Sagittal Posture Parameters: A Prospective Observational Study",
  "date": "2022 Sep 5",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report the clinical validation of the posture analyzing and virtual reconstruction device (PAViR) system, focusing on the accuracy of sagittal spinal parameters, compared with the EOS imaging system. Seventy patients diagnosed with segmental and somatic dysfunction were recruited between February 2020 and November 2020. Each patient was examined using the EOS imaging system and PAViR; the sagittal parameters of human body posture [forward head posture (FHP), T1 tilt angle (T1t), knee flexion angle (KF), lumbar lordosis angle (LL), and pelvic tilt angle (PT)] were analyzed to verify the correlation between the results of the two devices. The median differences in the results of the two devices showed significant differences in FHP (T4-frontal head and T4-auditory canal), T1t, and PT. In the correlation analysis, the values of FHP (C7-auditory canal, T4-frontal head, and T4-auditory canal), T1t, and PT showed a moderate correlation between the two devices (r = 0.741, 0.795, 0.761, 0.621, and 0.692, respectively) (p < 0.001). The KF and LL was fairly correlated (r = 0.514 and 0.536, respectively) (p = 0.004, both). This study presents the potential of a novel skeletal imaging system without radiation exposure, based on a 3D red-green-blue-depth camera (PAViR), as a next-generation diagnostic tool by estimating more accurate parameters through continuous multi-data-based upgrades with artificial intelligence technology."

  "title": "Strength and morphology of a suprahyoid muscle and their relationship to forward head posture in healthy older adults",
  "date": "2022 Sep",
  "abstract": "Aim: Forward head posture, an abnormality in head and trunk positioning, adversely affects suprahyoid muscle activity. Jaw-opening force, which reflects suprahyoid muscle strength, is a useful index of dysphagia. However, the relationship between forward head posture and strength and morphology of suprahyoid muscles remains unclear. This study aims to clarify the relationship between forward head posture, jaw-opening force and morphology of suprahyoid muscles.\nMethods: During October 2018, we enrolled older adults aged ≥65 years. The craniovertebral angle was measured, and an angle <49° was defined as forward head posture. Jaw-opening force was also measured. The geniohyoid muscle (GHM) was selected to represent the suprahyoid muscles, and its cross-sectional area and length were measured using ultrasonography. Sarcopenia was also determined based on the criteria of the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between morphological characteristics of the suprahyoid muscle and jaw-opening force as well as the association between the former and forward head posture.\nResults: Data of 87 participants were analyzed. Sex, cross-sectional area and length of the GHM, and sarcopenia were significantly associated with jaw-opening force. In addition, sex and forward head posture were significantly associated with the length of the GHM.\nConclusions: Our study demonstrated that an overextended length of suprahyoid muscles mediates the relationship between forward head posture and jaw-opening force. Forward head posture is easily visualized and can be a useful indicator of decline in suprahyoid muscle strength. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22: 779-784."

  "date": "2024 Feb",
  "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of and determine the best cutoff point for craniovertebral angle (CVA) and forward shoulder angle (FSA) in discriminating between two groups of individuals with different severities of forward head posture (FHP).\nMethods: A sample of 90 subjects aged 20-50 who had different severities of FHP was recruited. Participants were categorized into two groups based on observational method, namely individuals with slight FHP and those with moderate-to-severe FHP. The CVA and FSA were assessed using the photographic device. The accuracy of these measures was determined by calculation of sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, likelihood ratio (LR), and predictive value (PV).\nResults: Our results show that CVA has high sensitivity (0.93) and acceptable area under the curve (0.88) in discriminating between the two groups of FHP (P < .01), but FSA cannot discriminate between the two groups of FHP (P = .06). The LR and PV results show that the CVA has a low negative LR (0.13) and a large negative PV (0.93). The best cutoff point for CVA was determined at 45.5 degrees.\nConclusion: Overall, the results of the present study showed that CVA has a good accuracy in discriminating between two groups of individuals with slight and moderate-to-severe FHP. It can be valuable in correctly identifying the slight FHP and screening the moderate and severe grades of the FHP. Researchers and clinicians can also use the optimal cutoff point for the CVA obtained in this study to accurately quantify and classify the severity of the FHP."

  "title": "Repositioning forward-leaning vehicle occupants with a pre-pretensioner belt and a startle-based warning in pre-crash scenarios",
  "date": "2022",
  "abstract": "Objective: Pre-pretensioner (PPT) seatbelts have been found to be effective in controlling vehicle occupants' motion response to disturbances in optimally positioned occupants, but it is not clear how the PPT performs when the occupant is initially forward leaning. Previous work demonstrated that an acoustic startling pre-stimulus (ASPS) reduced trunk out-of-position in sled-simulated pre-crash maneuvers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if coupling the PPT with the ASPS could reduce the needed magnitude and rate of belt tension of the PPT to reposition forward leaning occupants to their optimal position within the seatbelt.\nMethods: Sixteen belt-restrained adult human volunteers (8 males and 8 females) restrained by a 3-point seatbelt on a vehicle seat in a forward leaning posture on a sled simulating pre-crash braking (approx. 1 g of maximum acceleration and 0.3 s duration) were exposed to sled perturbations with three belt configurations (low and high force PPT and no PPT), and two warning conditions (ASPS and no-ASPS). Head and trunk positions were extracted from the 3D motion-capture data. Repeated measure ANOVAs were used to understand the effect of sex, PPT, ASPS, and repetition on head and trunk positions. A survival analysis was also performed to understand the probability of the occupants moving rearward in the different conditions.\nResults: The probability of the head and trunk to move rearward from the initial position was greater with the PPT than without the PPT (p = 0.01) and with the high force level than the low force level (p = 0.01). The interaction effect of ASPS x PPT showed that with no PPT, there was a greater probability for the head to move rearward from the initial position with ASPS than without ASPS (p < 0.03). The trunk shows a similar trend to the head, but the ASPS vs no-ASPS differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.06). No sex differences were found.\nConclusions: The PPT, particularly the high level, may be an effective countermeasure on its own to reduce trunk and head out-of-position in forward leaning postures in pre-crash scenarios. The ASPS reduced the occupants' head forward position when the PPT was not available."

  "date": "2022",
  "abstract": "Background: Working in forced postures and standing continuously can be classified as straining the musculoskeletal system.\nObjective: Since such postures are frequently used in hospital canteen kitchens, we used kinematic analysis to determine the working postures of canteen kitchen staff.\nMethods: In this study, the daily work routine of 18 (11 w/7 m) workers of a hospital canteen kitchen (Frankfurt Main/Germany) aged 21-62 years (46±13 years) was examined by means of kinematic analysis (CULEA system; IFA; Sankt Augustin/Germany) and a detailed computerized analysis of the activities performed on-site. Angle values of the head and trunk were evaluated in accordance with ergonomic standards and presented using percentile values (P05-P95). The OWAS method was also employed to capture the proportions of standing, walking and sitting work.\nResults: The kinematic posture analysis showed for all activities on the conveyor belt a tendency towards a dorsally inclined body position: trunk inclination (-7.5° to 0), thoracic spine inclination or a bending forward (-11.3° to 0°) and curvature of the back within the thoracic spine (-15.2° to 0°). In addition, >90% of the \"activities on the belt\" (46% of the daily working routine) were carried out standing.\nConclusion: The activities on the conveyor belt were characterized by a tendency towards hyperextension of the trunk, possibly due to a too high working environment. Furthermore, an increased burden on body structures while standing can be concluded. From a primary prevention perspective, this increased standing load should be reduced by behavioral and relational prevention measures."

  "title": "Feasibility of a 4-Week Manual Therapy and Exercise Intervention on Posture and Function in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Pilot Study",
  "date": "2022 Jul-Sep",
  "abstract": "Background and purpose: Thoracic hyperkyphosis is a common condition that progresses with aging and has been associated with impaired functional performance, increased risk of falls, and even mortality. Previous studies to improve posture primarily used exercise for durations of 3 months or longer. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of a manual therapy intervention in community-dwelling older adults over a 4-week time frame that is comparable to the typical clinical setting, to test the appropriateness and procedures for the measurement of posture and function in the older population with hyperkyphosis, and to collect preliminary data to describe change in posture and function measures.\nMethods: Twenty-four participants with hyperkyphosis or forward head posture were recruited, and 22 participants completed this pilot study. Feasibility was measured based on attendance, tolerance, safety, and retention. Issues with measurement procedures were recorded. The intervention included manual therapy and exercise 3 times a week for 4 weeks to target spinal and peripheral joint stiffness, muscle lengthening, and muscle activation. Outcomes included height, kyphotic index (KI), Block Test, Acromion to Table (ATT), Timed Up and Go (TUG), 5 times sit-to-stand (5XSTS), Functional Reach (FR), 2-minute walk test (2MWT), and Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). Data collected at visits 1, 6, and 12 were analyzed using 1-way repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance.\nResults and discussion: Measurement and intervention protocols were found to be feasible. A significant effect for the aggregate dependent variables change over time was found. Univariate analysis of each dependent variable showed significance except for FR. All postural measures (height, KI, Block Test, and ATT) significantly improved statistically. The KI and ATT exceed the minimal detectable change for clinical significance. Function showed statistical improvements in the TUG, 5XSTS, 2MWT, and PSFS. Clinical significance was reached with the PSFS. Seven of 9 measures showed a statistically significant change in just 2 weeks.\nConclusions: This pilot study suggests that manual therapy and exercise applied to older adults shows promise for improvement in measures of posture and functional performance in a clinically feasible 4-week time frame."

  "date": "2022 Aug 5",
  "abstract": "Forward head posture measurement can be conducted using various methods and instruments. The selection of the appropriate method requires the factors of validity and reliability to be considered. This systematic review reports on the reliability and validity of the non-radiographic methods examined for measuring forward head posture. The review identified relevant studies following a systematic search of electronic databases. The studies were assessed for quality by two independent reviewers using a critical appraisal tool. The studies' data were extracted and assessed, and the results were synthesized qualitatively using a level of evidence approach. Twenty-one studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Both reliability and validity were investigated for five studies, whereas reliability only was investigated for 17 studies. In total, 11 methods of forward head posture measurement were evaluated in the retrieved studies. The validity of the methods ranged from low to very high. The reliability of the methods ranged from moderate to excellent. The strongest levels of evidence for reliability support the use of classic photogrammetry. For validity, the evidence is not conclusive. Further studies are required to strengthen the level of evidence on the reliability and validity of the remaining methods. It is recommended that this point be addressed in future research."

  "title": "Age-related asymmetry in anticipatory postural movements during unilateral arm movement and imagery",
  "date": "2022 Sep",
  "abstract": "Reaching movements of the arms are accompanied by anticipatory (APM) and compensatory postural motion (CPM) that counteract the resulting perturbations to body stability. Recent research has shown that these postural actions are also observable in the context of imagined arm movements. As motor imagery (MI) shares many neurophysiological and behavioral characteristics with physical movements, and MI training can affect subsequent performance, MI tasks provide a good setting for studying the anticipatory aspects of postural control. This study investigated APMs and CPMs of the head and hip of healthy young and older adults in the temporal vicinity of physical and imagined forward raises of the dominant and non-dominant arm. When MI of the dominant arm was self-initiated, both age groups showed APM in the anteroposterior plane. When the self-initiated MI was of the non-dominant arm, only the older group showed anteroposterior APM. The older group did not show APM when an expected arm movement (or MI) was made to an external signal. This suggests an age-related deficit in coordinating postural preparation with external events. Only the older group showed mediolateral APM, and only for dominant arm MI, indicating sensitivity to potential perturbation to the weaker, non-dominant side of the body. Overall, the older group showed more anticipatory postural motion at the head. Systematic APM for manual MI suggests that MI training may be an effective intervention for anticipatory postural control. An integrated model of postural support for executed and imagined limb movements is suggested."

  "date": "2022 Mar-Apr",
  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate differences between individuals with various forward head posture (FHP) severities with and without postural neck pain using craniovertebral angle and forward shoulder angle.\nMethod: Ninety participants age 20 to 50 years were categorized into the following 4 groups based on observational method and presence or absence of postural neck pain: (1) slight FHP group without pain, (2) slight FHP group with pain, (3) moderate-to-severe FHP group without pain, and (4) moderate-to-severe FHP group with pain. A digital imaging technique was used to measure the craniovertebral angle and forward shoulder angle in a standing position.\nResults: A 1-way analysis of variance test showed a significant difference for craniovertebral angle in the 4 groups (F = 22.04, P < .001). Tukey's test showed the difference in this variable was significant between slight FHP groups (with or without pain) and moderate-to-severe FHP groups (with or without pain) (P < .001). Although overall F indicated a significant difference (F = 4.11, P < .009) of the forward shoulder angle in 4 groups, Tukey's test revealed this was only significantly different in 2 groups: slight FHP with pain and moderate-to-severe FHP with pain (P = .005).\nConclusion: The craniovertebral angle in the 2 groups of moderate-to-severe FHP was significantly smaller than that in the 2 groups of slight FHP. However, the forward shoulder angle in the group of moderate-to-severe FHP with pain was only significantly smaller than that in slight FHP with pain. The results showed that including pain as a factor of categorization did not lead to a significant difference between various groups regarding craniovertebral angle and forward shoulder angle."

  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate sensorimotor integration and skill-related physical fitness components for participants with forward head posture (FHP) compared with strictly matched controls with normal head alignment.\nMaterial and methods: We measured FHP, sensorimotor processing, and skill-related physical fitness variables in 50 participants with FHP and in 50 participants matched for age, gender, and body mass index with normal FHP, defined as having a craniovertebral angle >55°. Sensorimotor processing and integration variables were: (1) amplitudes of the spinal N13, (2) brainstem P14, (3) parietal N20 and P27, and (4) frontal N30 potentials. The skill-related physical fitness variables selected for the study were (1) T-test agility, (2) leg power, (3) stork static balance test, and (4) Y-balance test.\nResults: There was a statistically significant difference between the FHP group and control group for the sensorimotor integration variable: frontal N30 potentials (P < .05). Additionally, between-group differences were found for the sensorimotor processing variables: amplitudes of spinal N13, brainstem P14, and parietal N20, and P27 (P < .05). Statistically significant differences between groups for the skill-related physical fitness variables were also identified: T-test agility, leg power, stork static balance test, and Y-balance test (P < .05). The magnitude of the craniovertebral angle showed a correlation with all measured variables (P < .05).\nConclusion: College athletes with FHP exhibited altered sensorimotor processing and integration measurements and less efficient skill-related physical fitness compared with athletes with normal sagittal head posture alignment."

  "title": "Analysis of 6YO pediatric human body model kinematics and kinetics to determine submarining across naturalistic seating postures",
  "date": "2022",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the kinematics and kinetics of a naturalistically seated 6-year-old (6YO) pediatric human body model and evaluate the metrics described by earlier studies for pediatric ATDs to indicate whether different postures and booster seats were more associated with submarining than others in a frontal impact.\nMethods: The PIPER 6YO pediatric human body model was restrained on a lowback (LBB) and a highback (HBB) booster child restraint seat (CRS) in four naturalistic seating postures: leaning-forward, leaning-inboard, leaning-outboard, and a pre-submarining posture, and a baseline reference seating position as per the FMVSS No. 213 protocol. A 2012 mid-size sedan finite element (FE) model was used as the vehicle environment. A standard 3-point lap-shoulder belt system was modeled to restrain the child and the CRS in the left-rear vehicle seat. Additionally, a No-CRS condition was modeled in a reference posture and pre-submarining posture in which the occupant's legs bent over the edge of the rear seat. 12 conditions were simulated in LS-DYNA R10.1.0, and kinematics and kinetics were compared to metrics as per prior literature: 1) maximum femur displacement and pelvis rotation, 2) maximum knee-head excursion and maximum change in torso angle, 3) lap belt trajectory relative to pelvis's coordinate frame.\nResults: The pre-submarining posture on the HBB depicted submarining in all metrics except for the lap belt trajectory. Only the pre-submarining posture in No-CRS depicted submarining through analysis of all metrics. For this pre-submarining No-CRS condition, the mid-abdominal compression was approximately 5 times greater than the average of the mid abdominal compression depths of all other cases and maximum abdominal pressure was at least 22.9 kPa higher than the rest of the conditions.\nConclusions: The results of this study suggest that metrics used to assess submarining for 6YO pediatric occupants in frontal impacts may need to be updated so that they are more accurate for both simulated and physical studies. In addition, the results of this study could be used to design booster seats that discourage postures that could lead to an increased likelihood of submarining-like characteristics in a frontal crash impact."

Pain and disability, DNFE, forward head angle (FHA) and forward shoulder angle (FSA) degrees, CROM, and joint position error (JPE) were measured before and after 6 weeks.\nResults: Clinical pilates exercises improved pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI), DNFE, posture, CROM (except extension), and JPE (p < 0.05). We found significant differences between CPEG and CG in the comparisons for the change of pain, NDI, DNFE, FSA, CROM (except extension), and JPE (except left rotation) (p < 0.05). NDI, FSA, and rotational JPE also improved in CG (p < 0.05). However, these improvements were significantly better in CPEG than CG (p < 0.05) except JPE in left rotation (p = 0.118).\nConclusion: In patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain, clinical pilates exercise is a safe and effective method to improve pain and disability, DNFE, posture, ROM, and proprioception.\nClinical trial registration: NCT03782584 retrospectively registered December 20 2018."

  "title": "The Human Neck is Part of the Musculoskeletal Core: Cervical Muscles Help Stabilize the Pelvis During Running and Jumping",
  "date": "2022 Jun 2",
  "abstract": "During locomotion, cervical muscles must be active to stabilize the head as the body accelerates and decelerates. We hypothesized that cervical muscles are also part of the linked chain of axial muscles that provide core stabilization against torques applied to the hip joint by the extrinsic muscles of the legs. To test whether specific cervical muscles play a role in postural stabilization of the head and/or core stabilization of the pelvic girdle, we used surface electromyography to measure changes in muscle activity in response to force manipulations during constant speed running and maximum effort counter-movement jumps. We found that doubling the mass of the head during both running and maximum effort jumping had little or no effect on (1) acceleration of the body and (2) cervical muscle activity. Application of horizontal forward and rearward directed forces at the pelvis during running tripled mean fore and aft accelerations, thereby increasing both the pitching moments on the head and flexion and extension torques applied to the hip. These manipulations primarily resulted in increases in cervical muscle activity that is appropriate for core stabilization of the pelvis. Additionally, when subjects jumped maximally with an applied downward directed force that reduced acceleration and therefore need for cervical muscles to stabilize the head, cervical muscle activity did not decrease. These results suggest that during locomotion, rather than acting to stabilize the head against the effects of inertia, the superficial muscles of the neck monitored in this study help to stabilize the pelvis against torques imposed by the extrinsic muscles of the legs at the hip joint. We suggest that a division of labor may exist between deep cervical muscles that presumably provide postural stabilization of the head versus superficial cervical muscles that provide core stabilization against torques applied to the pelvic and pectoral girdles by the extrinsic appendicular muscles."

  "abstract": "During future lunar missions, astronauts may be required to pilot vehicles while standing, and the associated kinematic and injury response is not well understood. In this study, we used human body modeling to predict unsuited astronaut kinematics and injury risk for piloted lunar launches and landings in the standing posture. Three pulses (2-5 g; 10-150 ms rise times) were applied in 10 directions (vertical; ± 10-degree offsets) for a total of 30 simulations. Across all simulations, motion envelopes were computed to quantify displacement of the astronaut's head (max 9.0 cm forward, 7.0 cm backward, 2.1 cm upward, 7.3 cm downward, 2.4 cm lateral) and arms (max 25 cm forward, 35 cm backward, 15 cm upward, 20 cm downward, 20 cm lateral). All head, neck, lumbar, and lower extremity injury metrics were within NASA's tolerance limits, except tibia compression forces (0-1543 N upper tibia; 0-1482 N lower tibia; tolerance-1350 N) and revised tibia index (0.04-0.58 upper tibia; 0.03-0.48 lower tibia; tolerance-0.43) for the 2.7 g/150 ms pulse. Pulse magnitude and duration contributed over 80% to the injury metric values, whereas loading direction contributed less than 3%. Overall, these simulations suggest piloting a lunar lander vehicle in the standing posture presents a tibia injury risk which is potentially outside NASA's acceptance limits and warrants further investigation."

  "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate the durability of the effects of corrective exercises on the postural alignment and stability of hyperkyphotic elderly with a history of falls. Balance disturbance and recurrent falls are directly related to changes in the alignment of physical posture and function of the elderly, and effective methods with durable effects on improving the postural stability of the elderly have always been under the attention of researchers.\nMethods: This study was a randomized clinical trial, and the statistical population included the elderly referred to neurology clinics. According to the research inclusion criteria (hyperkyphotic elderly with a history of falls during the last six months), 30 elderly aged 60 to 75 years old were purposefully selected and randomly divided into two groups of corrective exercises and control. The experimental group performed an exercise program based on the Alexander posture correction technique. Both groups were evaluated with forward head angle, kyphosis, the timed up and go test, postural stability, and fear of falling tests in three phases. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 21 software and the MANCOVA test and repeated-measures analysis of variance.\nResults: Data analysis showed significant improvements in the variables of forward head (p = 0.007), kyphosis(p = .001), balance(p = 0.002), postural stability(p = 0.001), and fear of falling(p = 0.001) in the experimental group. Post-test comparisons between the experimental and control groups showed significant differences in all variables except for kyphosis(p > .05), and follow-up analysis also revealed significant differences in all variables, except for the variables of forward head and kyphosis(p > .05).\nConclusions: Although the effects of corrective exercises in the elderly decreased regarding spinal alignment after three months, more lasting effects were seen in functional balance, postural stability, and fear of falling, suggesting this strategy as a stimulus for more mobility and a lower risk of falling in the elderly. Therefore, when using corrective exercises, it is possible to apply these exercises for a longer period of time to achieve more durable outcomes, especially regarding spinal alignment.\nTrial registration: This research was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( IRCT2016081529373N1 , Date of registration: 19/04/2017)."

  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 8 weeks of biofeedback on reaction time and central somatosensory conduction time in patients with forward head posture and cervical radiculopathy.\nMethods: We performed a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Seventy patients with forward head posture and cervical radiculopathy were randomly distributed into study and control groups. The study group received biofeedback forward head posture corrective exercise for 8 weeks, while the control group did not receive any treatment. The main outcome measures were reaction time and central somatosensory conduction time. The secondary outcome measures were the craniovertebral angles, nerve conduction time at N13 and N20, referred arm pain, and neck disability index.\nResults: After 4 weeks, there were nonsignificant differences between both groups in reaction time and central somatosensory conduction time (P > .05); while there were significant differences between both groups in N13, N20, craniovertebral angle, referred arm pain, and neck disability index scores (P < .05). After 8 weeks, there were significant differences between both groups in all outcome measures (P < .05).\nConclusion: In this study, participants receiving biofeedback forward head posture corrective exercise improved both reaction time and central somatosensory conduction time after 8 weeks when compared to a control, nontreatment group."

  "title": "Effects of manual therapy on body posture: Systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "date": "2022 Jul",
  "abstract": "Background: Several clinical trials investigated the effectiveness of MT on body posture, but a systematic review grouping the results of these studies was not found in the literature.\nResearch question: Does manual therapy (MT) cause postural changes?\nMethods: Inclusion criteria were: randomized controlled trials in any population; studies in which the primary intervention was the use of any MT technique; studies that evaluated the immediate, short, medium, or long-term effects of interventions on body posture; and studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals in any year and language. In March 2022, we conducted a search in the PUBMED, Cinahl, Embase, PEDro, and Cochrane Central databases that yielded 6627 articles, of which 38 including 1597 participants were eligible; of these, 35 could be grouped into 12 meta-analyses. The risk of bias was assessed using the PEDro scale and the certainty in the scientific evidence rated through the GRADE system.\nResults: The results allowed us to conclude with moderate certainty in the evidence that, when compared to no intervention or sham, in the short and medium term, MT reduced the forward head posture (14 studies, 584 individuals, 95%CI 0.38, 1.06), reduced thoracic kyphosis (5 studies, 217 individuals, 95%CI 0.37, 0.94), improved lateral pelvic tilt (5 studies, 211 individuals, 95%CI 0.11, 0.67) and pelvic torsion (2 studies, 120 individuals, 95%CI 0.44, 1.19) and increased plantar area (3 studies, 134 individuals, 95%CI 0.04, 0.74). With moderate certainty, there was no significant effect on shoulder protrusion (5 studies, 176 individuals, 95%CI -0.11, 0.61), shoulder alignment in the frontal plane (3 studies, 160 individuals, 95%CI -0.15, 0.52), scoliosis (2 studies, 26 individuals, 95%CI -1.57, 2.19), and pelvic anteversion (5 studies, 233 individuals, 95%CI -0.02, 0.51). With low certainty, MT had no effect on scapular upward rotation (2 studies, 74 individuals, 95%CI -0.76, 2.17). With low to very low certainty, it is possible to conclude that MT was not superior to other interventions in the short or medium term regarding the improvement of forward head posture (5 studies, 170 individuals, 95%CI -1.39, 0.67) and shoulder protrusion (3 studies, 94 individuals, 95%CI -4.04, 0.97).\nSignificance: MT can be recommended to improve forward head posture, thoracic kyphosis and pelvic alignment in the short and medium term, but not shoulder posture and scoliosis. MT reduces the height of the plantar arch and this must be taken into account in physical therapy planning. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021244423."

The patient presented with findings consistent with a diagnosis of BRP to include sharp pain, burning, and itching at the bilateral upper extremities over the C5 and C6 dermatomes with acquired excoriations over the affected regions. The only known palliative measure was applying icepacks. Plain film radiographs revealed mild degenerative change at the C4-C5 and C5-C6 levels and postural evaluation observed anterior head carriage with forward-rounded shoulders. He had pain upon palpation and motion restriction in the cervical spinal region. His trial of treatment consisted of manual cervical and thoracic spinal manipulation, manual cervical traction, prescription of a home exercise program, and acupuncture. At the conclusion of this trial, the patient's symptoms resolved and his acquired excoriations began to show signs of healing. A proposed etiology of BRP is cervical spine disease. There are limited case reports and retrospective studies in the literature that examine conservative care options targeting cervical spinal disease for the treatment of BRP. This case study reviews a patient diagnosed with BRP and confounding cervical spine disease who was treated with chiropractic and acupuncture, experiencing relief from his symptoms."

  "date": "2022 Sep",
  "abstract": "Background: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is an umbrella term for pain and dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and its associated structures. Patients with TMD show changes in TMJ kinematics and masticatory muscle activation. TMD is commonly comorbid with non-specific chronic neck pain (NCNP), which may be one of the risk factors for TMD.\nObjectives: This study aimed to investigate whether patients with NCNP have altered TMJ kinematics and masticatory muscle activity.\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional exploratory study including 19 healthy participants and 20 patients with NCNP but without TMD symptoms. TMJ kinematics was measured during mouth opening and closing, jaw protrusion and jaw lateral deviation. Surface electromyography was used to record the muscle activity of the anterior temporalis, masseter, sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius while clenching. Furthermore, cervical posture, cervical range of motion (ROM) and pressure-pain threshold of the neck and masticatory muscles were measured.\nResults: Compared with the healthy group, the NCNP group showed significantly reduced upper cervical rotation ROM (p = .041) and increased condylar path length (p = .02), condylar translation (opening p = .034, closing p = .011) and mechanical pain sensitivity of the upper trapezius (p = .018). Increased condylar translation was significantly correlated with reduced upper cervical mobility and poor cervical posture (r = -0.322 to -0.397; p = .012-.046).\nConclusion: Increased condylar translation and path length in patients with NCNP may indicate poor control of TMJ articular movement, which may result from neck pain or may be a compensation for limited neck mobility. Evaluation of excessive TMJ translation may be considered in patients with NCNP."

  "date": "2022 Jun 1",
  "abstract": "Background: Neck pain is a common problem in individuals despite different types of working patterns. Forward head posture is a common identified cause of chronic neck pain in patients. The effect of long-term forward head posture can be loss of function which can limit individuals' capacity to work or do activities of daily living; hence it becomes necessary to intervene with muscle strengthening to improve neck stability, as well as mobility.\nPurpose: To assess effectiveness of muscle energy technique (MET) and posture correction exercises on pain and function in patients with non-specific chronic neck pain having forward head posture.\nStudy setting: Outpatient department of Dr. D. Y. Patil College of Physiotherapy, Pune, India.\nParticipants: Both males and females between the ages of 21-60 years with a cranio-vertebral angle of less than 48° were included in study.\nResearch design: A randomized clinical trial.\nMethodology: MET group received muscle energy treatment + posture correction exercises, and control group receiving neck range of motion treatment. Outcomes measures were pain (Numerical Pain Rating Scale), function (Neck Disability Index), and cranio-vertebral angle (MB ruler).\nResults: Forty-eight subjects were included in the analysis, with 23 participants in Group A (MET) and 25 in Group B (Control). While both groups showed within-group improvements, Group A had significantly greater decreases in neck pain (p < .001), Neck Disability Index scores (p < .001), and significantly greater improvements in cranio-vertebral angles (p < .025) compared to group B.\nConclusion: The combined effect of MET and posture correction exercises provides significantly greater results than neck range of motion treatment, and muscle energy technique should be included in the treatment of non-specific chronic neck pain in individuals with forward head posture."

  "title": "Treatment of Gravitational Pulling Sensation in Patients With Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS): A Model-Based Approach",
  "date": "2022 May 23",
  "abstract": "Perception of the spatial vertical is important for maintaining and stabilizing vertical posture during body motion. The velocity storage pathway of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which integrates vestibular, optokinetic, and proprioception in the vestibular nuclei vestibular-only (VO) neurons, has spatio-temporal properties that are defined by eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its system matrix. The yaw, pitch and roll eigenvectors are normally aligned with the spatial vertical and corresponding head axes. Misalignment of the roll eigenvector with the head axes was hypothesized to be an important contributor to the oscillating vertigo during MdDS. Based on this, a treatment protocol was developed using simultaneous horizontal opto-kinetic stimulation and head roll (OKS-VOR). This protocol was not effective in alleviating the MdDS pulling sensations. A model was developed, which shows how maladaptation of the yaw eigenvector relative to the head yaw, either forward, back, or side down, could be responsible for the pulling sensation that subjects experience. The model predicted the sometimes counter-intuitive OKS directions that would be most effective in re-adapting the yaw eigenvector to alleviate the pulling sensation in MdDS. Model predictions were consistent with the treatment of 50 patients with a gravitational pulling sensation as the dominant feature. Overall, pulling symptoms in 72% of patients were immediately alleviated after the treatment and lasted for 3 years after the treatment in 58% of patients. The treatment also alleviated the pulling sensation in patients where pulling was not the dominant feature. Thus, the OKS method has a long-lasting effect comparable to that of OKS-VOR readaptation. The study elucidates how the spatio-temporal organization of velocity storage stabilizes upright posture and how maladaptation of the yaw eigenvector generates MdDS pulling sensations. Thus, this study introduces a new way to treat gravitational pull which could be used alone or in combination with previously proposed VOR readaptation techniques."

  "title": "Impact of adding scapular stabilization to postural correctional exercises on symptomatic forward head posture: a randomized controlled trial",
  "date": "2022 Oct",
  "abstract": "Background: One of the most overspread postural abnormalities is forward head posture (FHP) and it is described as head projection anteriorly in relation to the trunk which appears mainly in sagittal plane. Scapular stabilization exercise (SSE) is capable of restoring each of thoracic cage and head neutral optimum position by neck and shoulder muscles interactions and through controlling scapular position and movement.\nAim: This study was conducted to investigate the impact of adding scapular stabilization (SSE) to postural correctional exercises (PCE) on symptomatic FHP.\nDesign: The pre-post single-masking (assessor) randomized experimental trial.\nSetting: Participants with postural dysfunction in form of FHP admitted to outer clinic of the Faculty of Physical Therapy.\nPopulation: Sixty participants (20 to 35 years) with symptomatic FHP and recruited from outer clinic at faculty of physical therapy.\nMethods: Participants were allocated randomly by opaque sealed envelope to two groups who are referred from an orthopedist: Group \"A\" received SSE and postural correction exercises, whereas Group \"B\" received only postural correctional exercises; treatments were performed three times/week for 10 weeks. The craniovertebral angle, pressure pain threshold, cervical flexor and extensor muscles endurance, Arabic neck disability index, upper trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscle root mean square during rest and activity were used to evaluate the patients' pretreatment and post-treatment.\nResults: Within group analysis for sixty participants reported statistical significant difference between baseline and post-treatment as P value <0.05 with more refinement in stabilization exercise group.\nConclusions: Adding SSEs to PCEs is more effective method than PCEs seldom for the management of FHP patients.\nClinical rehabilitation impact: Both scapular stabilization and postural correction exercise increase craniovertebral angle and pressure pain threshold (PPT) and decrease muscle activity and disability. Scapular stabilization alone increase craniovertebral angle and PPT and decrease muscle activity and disability more than postural correction exercise. In addition of statistical significant difference in all variables but there were clinical change in disability only."

  "title": "Spine Posture, Mobility, and Stability of Top Mobile Esports Athletes: A Case Series",
  "date": "2022 May 11",
  "abstract": "Professional esports athletes spend a long time in the same sitting posture during training and competition. Mobile esports may exacerbate potential postural problems because of the closer and unsupported arms and because athletes spend more time in a forward-/flexed-head posture. Prolonged sitting in these postures carries significant health risks and may lead to musculoskeletal problems and injuries. The objective of this retrospective study is to assess the posture, mobility, and stability of the spine for professional mobile esports athletes. We collected spine-assessment data from 48 athletes participating in a top-tier league on a real-time-strategy battle-arena online game. The spinal assessment was conducted using the SpinalMouse® under upright standing and trunk flexion in addition to the Matthiass test. Measurements were converted into Idiag Scores by the SpinalMouse® software. The Idiag Posture, Idiag Mobility, and Idiag Stability scores were 62.50 (IQR: 21), 63.50 (IQR: 19.5), and 54.50 (IQR: 14.5), respectively, and were significantly lower (p < 0.001) than the reference normative value (100). Age was found to have a weak positive correlation with the posture score (ρ = 0.29, p = 0.048). Although career duration appeared to lower the scores, the association was insignificant (p > 0.05). The scores also had no significant association with body height, body mass, body mass index, and esports team (p > 0.05). It was anticipated that mobile-based esports would attenuate the biomechanics of the spine and increase the likelihood of musculoskeletal problems, such as neck and back pain."

Joint position sense errors, forward head and protracted shoulder posture, DCFs, and the superficial cervical muscles were evaluated. Smartphone Addiction Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and International Physical Activity Questionnaire were used.\nResults: Regression analysis indicated that smartphone addiction and superficial cervical muscle strengths affect the performance of DCFs independently (p < 0.05). SAS was correlated with JPSE-flexion (r = 0.408), DCF activity/performance score (r = -0.453/r = -0.431), forward head posture (r = -0.412), and cervical flexor/extensor muscle strengths (r = -0.313/r = -0.319).\nConclusion: Smartphone addiction and cervical superficial muscles are related to the performance of the DCFs in young people. Using smartphones causes impaired joint position sense in flexion, decreased DCF activity, and forward head posture."

  "date": "2022 Apr 27",
  "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have addressed the effects of different exercises and modalities on forward head posture (FHP), but the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of the effect of exercises on FHP remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of selective corrective exercises (SCEs) on the craniovertebral angle (CVA) and shoulder angle (SA) in students with FHP and to establish MCID for these angles.\nMethods: In this randomized clinical trial study, a total of 103 second-grade male students with FHP were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. CVA and SA of participants were measured before and after the 8-week selective corrective exercise program (including strengthening and stretching exercises). The photogrammetric method was used to measure CVA and SA. MCID value was calculated for CVA and SA using the distribution method.\nResults: The results showed that there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of CVA (F = 89.04, P = 0.005, Effect size = 0.47) and SA (F = 18.83, P = 0.005, Effect size = 0.16). After eight weeks of selective corrective exercises, the MCID values of CVA and SA were 1.40° and 1.34°, respectively.\nConclusion: This study revealed that the selective corrective exercises might lead to postural correction of students having FHP problem. Results further indicated that a corrective exercise program would be considered beneficial if it increased CVA and SA values at least 1.40 and 1.34 degrees, respectively."

  "title": "Age-related changes to vestibular heave and pitch perception and associations with postural control",
  "date": "2022 Apr 19",
  "abstract": "Falls are a common cause of injury in older adults (OAs), and age-related declines across the sensory systems are associated with increased falls risk. The vestibular system is particularly important for maintaining balance and supporting safe mobility, and aging has been associated with declines in vestibular end-organ functioning. However, few studies have examined potential age-related differences in vestibular perceptual sensitivities or their association with postural stability. Here we used an adaptive-staircase procedure to measure detection and discrimination thresholds in 19 healthy OAs and 18 healthy younger adults (YAs), by presenting participants with passive heave (linear up-and-down translations) and pitch (forward-backward tilt rotations) movements on a motion-platform in the dark. We also examined participants' postural stability under various standing-balance conditions. Associations among these postural measures and vestibular perceptual thresholds were further examined. Ultimately, OAs showed larger heave and pitch detection thresholds compared to YAs, and larger perceptual thresholds were associated with greater postural sway, but only in OAs. Overall, these results suggest that vestibular perceptual sensitivity declines with older age and that such declines are associated with poorer postural stability. Future studies could consider the potential applicability of these results in the development of screening tools for falls prevention in OAs."

  "abstract": "Background: Ophthalmologists/Optometrists have a high incidence of neck pain. Little research has been conducted on specific equipment that predisposes these professionals to cervical discomfort.\nObjective: Primary purpose: to determine if neck position is altered by slit lamp table design. Secondary purpose: to confirm the prevalence of neck pain in eye care professionals.\nMethods: A survey of work-related pain was administered to 36 subjects (8 ophthalmologist, 2 optometrists, 26 technicians). The craniovertebral (CV) angle was measured in each subject in three separate positions (resting posture, best posture, slit lamp posture) between two different slit lamps/tables: slit lamp-deep and slit lamp-shallow.\nResults: 79% of subjects reported neck pain in the last 6 months. The mean CV angle of all subjects at resting posture, best posture, and both slit lamp postures differed significantly. There was also a difference in CV angle between slit lamps.\nConclusion: Neck pain is more prevalent in eye professionals than in the general population. The use of slit lamps promotes a forward head posture which decreases the CV angle, putting the user at risk for neck pain. By altering slit lamp table design, the CV angle of eye care professionals can be increased, reducing the risk for neck injury."

  "date": "2022 Apr 11",
  "abstract": "Gait initiation (GI), the transient period between quiet standing and locomotion, is a functional task classically used in the literature to investigate postural control. This study aimed to investigate the influence of an experimentally-induced alteration of cervical spine mobility (CSM) on GI postural organisation. Fifteen healthy young adults initiated gait on a force-plate in (1) two test conditions, where participants wore a neck orthosis that passively simulated low and high levels of CSM alteration; (2) one control condition, where participants wore no orthosis; and (3) one placebo condition, where participants wore a cervical bandage that did not limit CSM. Centre-of-pressure and centre-of-mass kinematics were computed based on force-plate recordings according to Newton's second law. Main results showed that anticipatory postural adjustments amplitude (peak backward centre-of-pressure shift and forward centre-of-mass velocity at toe-off) and motor performance (step length and forward centre-of-mass velocity at foot-contact) were altered under the condition of high CSM restriction. These effects of CSM restriction may reflect the implementation of a more cautious strategy directed to attenuate head-in-space destabilisation and ease postural control. It follows that clinicians should be aware that the prescription of a rigid neck orthosis to posturo-deficient patients could exacerbate pre-existing GI deficits."

  "date": "2022 Apr 4",
  "abstract": "Background: Postural rehabilitation plays an important role in the treatment of non-specific low back pain. Although pelvic inclination has been widely used to improve lumbar lordosis, the effect of cervical anterior inclination on lumbar lordosis in young and older adults in sitting and standing posture is still unclear. This preliminary study was designed to examine the influence of changing the cervical anterior angle on the lumbar lordosis angle, through alterations of the head position under the natural sitting and standing conditions, aiming to provide a basis for establishing a new postural rehabilitation strategy.\nMethods: Thirty-six young (24.0 ± 2.2 years, 14 females and 22 males) and 38 older (68.4 ± 5.9 years, 36 females and 2 males) healthy adults participated in this study. The four spinal regional angles-cervical anterior angle, thoracic kyphosis angle, lumbar lordosis angle, and pelvic forward inclination angle, were measured in standing and relaxed sitting postures to determine the effects of a postural cueing for the head and neck posture, \"inclining head backward and performing chin tuck,\" on lumbar lordosis angle.\nResults: In the standing posture, the pelvic forward inclination angle in the older adult group was significantly smaller (P < 0.001, by ANOVA) than that in the young adult group and increased significantly (P < 0.001) in response to the postural cueing. In addition, the thoracic kyphosis angle in the standing (P = 0.001) and sitting (P = 0.003) positions was significantly reduced in response to the postural cueing. However, the lumbar lordosis angle in response to the postural cueing increased significantly in both the standing position (P < 0.001) and sitting position (P < 0.001).\nConclusion: The results suggest that increasing the cervical anterior angle can increase the lumbar lordosis angle, and the cervical anterior inclination can be used as an alternative to pelvic forward inclination to improve the lumbar lordosis angle. Furthermore, the change in head and neck posture can reduce the thoracic kyphosis angle, making it possible to establish a new noninvasive body posture rehabilitation strategy."

  "abstract": "Introduction: Exercise can decrease fall risk in older adults but less is known about training to reduce injury risk in the event a fall is unavoidable. The purpose of this study was to compare standard fall prevention exercises to novel Fall Arrest Strategy Training (FAST); exercises designed to improve upper body capacity to reduce fall-injury risk in older women.\nMethod: Forty women (mean age 74.5 years) participated in either Standard (n = 19) or FAST (n = 21) twice per week for 12 weeks. Both interventions included lower body strength, balance, walking practice, agility and education. FAST added exercises designed to enhance forward landing and descent control such as upper body strengthening, speed and practice of landing and descent on outstretched hands.\nResults: Both FAST and Standard significantly improved strength, mobility, balance, and fall risk factors from pre to post-intervention. There was a significant time by group interaction effect for upper body response time where FAST improved but Standard did not (p = 0.038).\nDiscussion: FAST resulted in similar gains in factors that reduce fall risk as a standard fall prevention program; with the additional benefit of improving speed of arm protective responses; a factor that may help enhance landing position and reduce injury risks such as head impact during a forward fall."

  "title": "Therapeutic routine with respiratory exercises improves posture, muscle activity, and respiratory pattern of patients with neck pain: a randomized controlled trial",
  "date": "2022 Mar 9",
  "abstract": "Neck pain and forward head posture (FHP) are typical in prolonged smartphone users and need to be targeted for treatment. We aimed to compare the effect of a routine therapeutic program with and without respiratory exercises on smartphone users with FHP and non-specific chronic neck pain (NSCNP). Sixty patients (aged 24.7 ± 2.1 years) with FHP and NSCNP were randomly assigned to the routine therapeutic program (n = 20), combined respiratory exercises with a routine therapeutic program (n = 20), or control (n = 20) groups. At baseline, there was no difference among groups at all variables. Each programme was implemented three times a week for eight weeks. Primary Outcome was pain measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), and secondary ones were forward head angle, the activity of specific muscles, and respiratory patterns, measured by photogrammetry, electromyography and manual, respectively. All outcomes were measured at baseline and eight weeks post-treatment. We used the repeated measures analysis of variance to examine the interaction between time and group, paired t-test for intragroup comparison, one-way analysis of variance for intergroup comparison, and Tukey post hoc test at a significant level 95% was used. There were significant differences in the combined group compared with the routine therapeutic group (P = 0.03) for diaphragm muscle activation, respiratory balance (P = 0.01), and the number of breaths (P = 0.02). There were significant within-group changes from baseline to post-treatment in the combined group for all outcomes above, but no changes in the therapeutic exercise routine group. Despite respiratory pattern, none of the secondary outcomes proved to be superior in the combination group compared to the routine therapeutic program in smartphone users with FHP and NSCNP. Future studies with longer follow-up assessments could strengthen these results.Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials using the IRCT website with ID number of, IRCT20200212046469N1 \"Prospectively registered\" at 04/03/2020."

  "title": "Effectiveness of posture-correction interventions for mechanical neck pain and posture among people with forward head posture: protocol for a systematic review",
  "date": "2022 Mar 9",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Forward head posture (FHP) is the most common postural deviation of the upper back. It is believed to be one of the predisposing factors for the development of mechanical neck pain (MNP). We propose doing a systematic review to find the effectiveness of interventions targeted on FHP with MNP and assess implementation fidelity associated with these interventions.\nMethods and analysis: Medline (PubMed), Web of Science (Social Science Citation Index), EMBASE, Scopus, PEDro and CINAHL databases will be searched for studies published in English from their inception. Forward and backward citations of the included studies will be investigated for identifying additional records. We will include randomised controlled trials and non/quasi-experimental studies with two groups assessing the effectiveness of interventions targeted on FHP with MNP. Observational studies, non-randomised studies with single group and reviews will be excluded. We will consider the following outcome measures: postural variables of FHP, neck pain, performance-based functional disability scores of the neck, quality of life, basic activities of daily living and work-related outcomes. The unique citations will be screened by titles/abstracts and full texts, independently. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool will be used to critically appraise the included studies. The risk of bias and data abstraction of included studies will be undertaken independently. A qualitative synthesis will be conducted and, if sufficient studies with comparable outcome measures are available, we will statistically pool the result.\nEthics and dissemination: We will undertake a systematic review of primary studies, and will not directly recruit participants hence, ethical clearance is not applicable. We will aim to present the findings of the completed systematic review at an international conference and subsequently submit the manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal for publication.\nProspero registration number: CRD42021250310."

  "date": "2022 Jan 20",
  "abstract": "Objective: To explore the prevalence and risk factors of neck musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) of welders among an automobile factory. Methods: In June 2019, a cluster random sampling method was used to select 677 electric welders from an automobile manufacturing plant in Shiyan City as the survey objects, and a questionnaire survey was conducted using the \"Musculoskeletal Disorders Questionnaire\" to analyze the prevalence and influencing factors of neck MSDs, and used logistic regression to analyze the relationship between the influencing factors and the prevalence of cervical MSDs. Results: The prevalence rate of MSDs in neck of welders was 54.8% (371/677) . The exposure rate of occupational factors, from high to low, were neckin a bent formord porsure was 71.6% (486/677) , repetitive head movements was 55.1% (373/677) , working in uncomfortable postures was 48.7% (330/677) and neck twisted was 46.8% (317/677) respectively. Sex, age, educational level, length of service, smoking, neck tilt, neck twist, working in uncomfortable posture and head repetitive movements were the risk factors of neck MSDs (P<0.05) . Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that, the main influencing factors of neck MSDs were sex, education level, age, length of service, smoking, neck tilt, working in uncomfortable posture (OR = 2.11, 2.03, 1.83, 1.21, 1.78, 1.90, 1.58, 95%CI: 1.28~3.48、1.47~2.81、1.33~2.52、1.03~1.41、1.22~2.60、1.28~2.83、1.11~2.27, P<0.05) , rest had protective effect on neck MSDs (OR= 0.38, 95%CI: 0.17~0.88, P<0.05) . Conclusion: Welders in automobile factory was highly exposed to occupational risk factors for neck MSDs. Occupational risk factors such as neck in a bent forward posture, working in an uncomfortable posture, prolonged siting, repetitive head movement should be the focus of intervention."

  "date": "2022 Jan",
  "abstract": "Background: Postural asymmetry is natural and expected during postural assessment. Besides, there are conditions that exacerbate the difference between right and left side views, such as Idiopathic Scoliosis (IS). However, the photogrammetric postural assessment on sagittal plane is usually performed using only one side view. This study aimed testing if there are differences between the right and the left-side views in photogrammetric postural assessment of adults on sagittal plane.\nMethods: Patients with and without scoliosis were assessed and were grouped into Control Group (CG) and Positive Adam's test Group (PAG) according to Adam's forward bending test. After screening, participants were assessed using the right and the left-side views according DIPA© protocol. Descriptive and inferential analysis were made using Paired t-Test and Independence Chi-square Test (χ2).\nResults: Significant differences were found between right and left side views to knee angle and head position angle to overall sample. The mean difference was low, about 1° on head position and 2.6° on knee angle and did not affect the classification of body segments.\nConclusion: We conclude that the postural assessment on sagittal plane of adults without IS can be performed using only one side view, becoming the photogrammetric postural assessment an easy-to-use tool."

  "abstract": "Smartphone users' posture can affect the musculoskeletal load of the user's neck. This study aims to compare the effect of the posture of using smartphones on head and neck angles among college students. The cross-sectional study was conducted among 80 college students. The Severity of Neck Pain (SNP) and the head and neck tilt angles, the gaze angle, and the amount of change in the forward head posture were determined. The angles were measured in three postures including standing, sitting on a chair with and without a backrest. Most of the participants (51.3%) reported moderate and severe neck pain. The angles during using smartphone had a significant difference in different positions, so that the best head (100.6 ± 11.3°) and neck (32.5 ± 11.2°) tilt angles and gaze angle (58.2 ± 13.7°) were in sitting position with leaning on a backrest of the chair. Head (109.6 ± 14.4°) and neck (22.0 ± 12.6°) tilt angles, and the forward head posture (15.9 ± 4.9 cm) have the worst posture in sitting position on a chair without a backrest while gaze angle (67.1 ± 12.0°) has the most awkward posture in standing. Practitioner summary: The posture of using a smartphone affects the amount of pressure on the neck. This study aims to investigate the effect of different positions of using smartphone on head and neck angles among Iranian university students. The angles during using smartphone had a significant difference in different positions."

  "title": "The association between forward head posture and non-specific neck pain: A cross-sectional study",
  "date": "2023 Aug 3",
  "abstract": "Background: Poor posture is traditionally associated with various musculoskeletal disorders. Consequently, educators in the musculoskeletal field have been teaching postural observation as part of the physical assessment. Forward head posture (FHP) is hypothesized to be associated with neck pain; however, evidence in this topic remains inconclusive.\nPurpose: To investigate the association between FHP and neck pain intensity, disability, and cervical kinematics in individuals with neck pain compared to asymptomatic individuals. A secondary aim of this study was to explore the possible effect of a head-mounted display (HMD) used in a virtual reality (VR) assessment on FHP.\nMethods: The study was conducted with 43 volunteers (20 asymptomatic individuals, 23 individuals with neck pain) aged 19 to 62. FHP was assessed by measuring craniovertebral angle on profile photographs. Secondary outcome measures included pain intensity, the neck disability index (NDI) questionnaire, and neck kinematics using specialized VR software.\nResults: There were no significant differences between individuals with neck pain and asymptomatic individuals in FHP (craniovertebral angle = 48.24°±7.29; 48.90°±5.89, respectively, p > .05). The neck pain group demonstrated a restricted range of motion and slower neck movements (p < .05). We found no significant correlation between FHP and visual analog scale, NDI, and most neck kinematic measures.\nConclusions: Our findings cannot support a clinically applicable association between FHP and neck pain. Additionally, individuals with neck pain had a lower range of motion and slower neck movements."

  "title": "The psoas major muscle is essential for bipedal walking - An analysis using a novel upright bipedal-walking android model",
  "date": "2022 May",
  "abstract": "Background: Bipedalism is a unique function in humans. Various investigations in bipedal walking have assessed the kinetic chain from the pelvis to the lower limbs. However, few studies have investigated the functions of the upper body including the psoas major muscles. In the present study, a bipedal-walking human full-body skeletal model, \"the bipedal android model\", was generated by attaching air cylinder devices to simulate the contraction and relaxation of various muscles required for bipedal walking, including the psoas major muscles. The bipedal-walking principle was discussed using the model.\nMethods: Every part of a human full-body skeletal model was connected by wires or cables to retain the mobility of each joint. Then the psoas major (PM), gluteus minimus (GM), long head of biceps femoris (BF), quadriceps femoris (QF), and semimembranosus (SM) muscles were simulated in the skeletal model using air cylinders. The gait pattern was observed by synchronizing the contraction of PM, GM, QF and SM, and relaxation of BF of the ipsilateral side together with the reversed patterns in the contralateral side, and then switching the phase by every step. The gait pattern in dysfunction of PM or GM muscles was also observed by disconnecting the corresponding air cylinders.\nResults: The synchronized contraction of PM, GM, QF and SM generates the force to tilt the upper body to ipsilateral side, followed by elevation of the lower limb together with the forward rotation of the pelvis in the contralateral side to swing the leg forward. The next step was generated by reversing the contraction phase at the landing of the swung leg. The dysfunction of PM muscle disabled effective gait in the model, while GM did not.\nSignificance: The bipedal android model indicated that the psoas major muscles play a crucial role in bipedal walking in human."

  "date": "2022 Feb 19",
  "abstract": "Background: Balance Body Tape (BBT) is a recently developed taping-method with the aim to reduce pain and improve posture through change in movement behavior. However, the potential effects of a treatment with BBT are scarcely documented. Therefore, the aim with this study was to investigate the effect of a three-week Balance body tape-treatment on the intensity of perceived neck, shoulder and back pain and forward head posture.\nMethods: In this RCT study, subjects (n = 26), who reported being university students or having a sedentary work and experiencing pain in neck, back or shoulders, were randomized to either an intervention (n = 12) or control group (n = 14). The intervention group received a three-week treatment with BBT, the control group received no treatment. A questionnaire regarding pain, including a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) measuring pain intensity, and a Photographic posture analysis measurement (PPAM) regarding the craniovertebral (CV) angle were assessed before and after the intervention for both groups. Wilcoxon's signed rank test and Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess intra- and between group differences respectively. The relationship between pain intensity and CV angle was assessed using Spearman's correlation.\nResults: No difference in demographic and physical characteristics between the groups were noted at baseline (p > 0.05). Pain intensity at baseline was 5 for the intervention group and 4 for the control group (p = 0.330). At follow up, the intervention group reported a lower score (NRS = 2.5, p = 0.003) whereas the control group had no significant difference in pain intensity (NRS = 3, p = 0.086). No significant change was found in the CV angle (p = 0.058) and no correlation was found between NRS and the CV angle (r = 0.102, p = 0.619).\nConclusion: A short treatment period with BBT may, compared to no treatment, have a small reducing effect on pain intensity in neck, back and/or shoulders. However, no effect was found on forward head posture in this study.\nTrial registration: Registered retrospectively on 08/11/2021. NCT05111704 . Trial registration page link."

  "title": "Evidence-Based Corrective Exercise Intervention for Forward Head Posture in Adolescents and Young Adults Without Musculoskeletal Pathology: A Critically Appraised Topic",
  "date": "2022 Feb 16",
  "abstract": "Clinical scenario: Habitual overuse of cellphones is on the rise among adolescents and young adults. Those who maintain a flexed neck posture when using a cellphone for extended periods possess an elevated risk for developing forward head posture (FHP). Chronic FHP can lead to painful medical disorders affecting the head, neck, and shoulders. Both stretching and strengthening exercises are advocated interventions to address this postural abnormality; however, due to a wide range of corrective exercise programming in the literature, the decision for which exercises to prescribe for this condition can be challenging for clinicians.\nClinical question: For adolescents and young adults without musculoskeletal pathology, what are the most frequent stretching and strengthening exercises incorporated into effective FHP intervention programs supported by current randomized control trials?\nSummary of key findings: A combined total of 5 stretches and 8 strengthening exercises were identified across 3 studies of level 1b evidence that successfully impacted FHP using a combined stretching and strengthening corrective exercise intervention. The supine chin tuck and a sternocleidomastoid stretch were utilized in all 3 studies, while scapular retraction and a pectoralis stretch were included in 2 of the 3 studies.\nClinical bottom line: Based on the results of this appraisal, the most frequent stretches and strengthening exercises incorporated into effective FHP intervention programs supported by current randomized control trials focused on adolescents or young adults without musculoskeletal pathology include a sternocleidomastoid stretch, pectoralis stretch, the supine chin tuck, and scapular retraction.\nStrength of recommendation: There is \"Good\" to \"Excellent\" evidence from 3 level 1b randomized control trials to support the inclusion of a sternocleidomastoid stretch, pectoralis stretch, the supine chin tuck, and scapular retraction exercises into a corrective exercise program to address forward head posture."

  "date": "2023 Jul 3",
  "abstract": "Objective: The study aims to assess the effect of spinal mobilization and postural correction exercises in patients suffering from cervicogenic headache.\nMethods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 72 patients. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups: spinal mobilization (n = 24), postural correction exercises (n = 24), and control group (n = 24). The primary outcome measure was headache impact test-6, and secondary outcomes were headache intensity, neck pain intensity, and neck pain-related disability measured at baseline, postintervention, and follow-up period.\nResult: Comparison of baseline data (at 0 weeks) among groups showed a statistically nonsignificant difference. There was statistically significant improvement at postintervention (immediately after fourth week) in postural correction exercises group [headache disability: 14.95 ± 7.91 (p < .001); headache intensity: 2.58 ± 1.24 (p < .001); neck disability: 27.66 ± 18.71 (p < .001); neck pain: 1.91 ± 1.44 (p < .001)] and spinal mobilization group [headache disability: 13.83 ± 6.21 (p < .001); headache intensity: 2.29 ± 1.23 (p < .001); neck disability: 23.39 ± 19.51 (p < .001); neck pain: 1.72 ± 0.84 (p < .001)] as compared to the control group. The result of within-group analysis suggests that there was a statistically significant improvement in postintervention (immediately after fourth week) and follow-up (immediately after eighth week) scores as compared to baseline (at 0 weeks) scores for all outcomes in postural correction exercises [headache disability (p < .001), headache intensity (p < .001), neck disability (p < .001), neck pain (p < 0 .001)] as well as in spinal mobilization group [headache disability (p < .001), headache intensity (p < .001), neck disability (p < .001), neck pain (p < .001 for pre versus post; p = .001 for pre versus follow-up)]. There was a statistically nonsignificant difference between postintervention and follow-up scores of all the outcomes in the postural correction exercise and spinal mobilization group, which indicates that improvement in these groups was maintained during the follow-up period.\nConclusion: Spinal mobilization and postural correction exercises are effective in the management of cervicogenic headache."

  "date": "2022 Jan 18",
  "abstract": "Text neck describes an overuse injury of the cervical spine resulting from the repetitive stress of prolonged forward head flexion while looking down on a mobile screen. This case report describes a 24-year-old young man who presented with a 12-month history of head and neck pain and paresthesia of the right upper limb. The patient worked as a YouTuber and has been editing and posting videos on the website for three years. One year prior to referral for chiropractic assessment, the patient first visited his family physician for similar complaints. Based on cervical radiographs, the diagnosis of cervical spondylosis was given. Previous management included pain medication and muscle relaxants. Interventions included repeated physical therapy, cervical traction, and acupuncture, with some temporary relief during the subsequent year. However, severe flare-up of the symptoms occurred, which was brought about by working for extended periods on his smartphone, for which the patient sought chiropractic attention. X-ray imaging showed cervical kyphosis with C5 vertebral rotation, hypertonicity of the paraspinal muscles, and paresthesia in the right C6 dermatome distribution, which were consistent with text neck syndrome associated with cervical spondylosis and right C6 radiculopathy. The intervention consisted of improving posture while texting, cervical manipulation, and extension traction therapy. After 9 months of treatment sessions, the symptomatic and functional improvement was reflected by the radiographic changes in the cervical curve correction and the normalized paraspinal muscle tension on surface electromyology. Frequent breaks along with correct posture while using smartphones will be the key entities to prevent the occurrence of text neck syndrome."

  "abstract": "Background: Computer-intensive office work associations with health challenges may intensify following COVID-19 pandemic-related changes to home-based office work.\nObjective: To determine working conditions, perception and physical elements affecting health after pivoting to full time home-work.\nMethods: An online questionnaire addressed physical, productivity, motivation, and work-practice factors. Photos of the worker in their home-work environment showed side and front-back perspectives.\nResults: Sixteen questionnaires were received, and 12 respondents supplied photos. Home and office workplace differences varied. Ten felt productivity was affected, most often positively. Four noted increased pain or fatigue intensity, particularly in the eyes, neck / head, lower back, and shoulders. Working posture was not optimal; six didn't use traditional chair-sitting for up to half the day. Forward and backward trunk inclination accounted for at least 10% of the workday for 12 respondents; lateral inclination affected ten and eight had unsupported legs. Fifteen used an adjustable chair, but photos revealed ergonomic recommendations were not consistently followed. Fourteen participants communicated regularly by telephone, eight only for moderate duration and ten using adapted telephone equipment. Half of the ROSA scores were high.\nConclusions: Workers forced into telework during the pandemic experience positive and negative impacts. Postures vary more than in offices, potentially increasing health risk."

  "date": "2022 Jan 28",
  "abstract": "Pursed-lip breathing (PLB) and forward trunk lean posture (FTLP) are commonly used to relieve dyspnea and improve ventilation in a rehabilitation program. However, their effect on chest wall volumes and movements in older adults without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has never been investigated. This observational study aimed to identify the effect of combined PLB and FTLP on total and regional chest wall volumes, ventilatory pattern, and thoracoabdominal movement using in older adults. It was hypothesized that the combined PLB with FTLP would result in the highest chest wall volumes among the experimental tasks. Twenty older adults performed 2 breathing patterns of quiet breathing (QB) and PLB during a seated upright (UP) position and FTLP. An optoelectronic plethysmography system was used to capture the chest wall movements during the 4 experimental tasks. Tidal volume (VT) was separated into pulmonary ribcage, abdominal ribcage, and abdomen volume. The changes in anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) chest wall diameters at 3 levels were measured and used to identify chest wall mechanics to improve chest wall volumes. The PLB significantly improved ventilation and chest wall volumes than the QB (P < .05). VT of pulmonary ribcage, VT of abdominal ribcage, and VT were significantly higher during the PLB + UP (P < .05) and during the PLB + FTLP (P < .01) as compared to those of QB performed in similar body positions. However, there was no significant in total and regional lung volumes between the PLB + UP and the PLB + FTLP. The AP diameter changes at the angle of Louis and xiphoid levels were greater during the PLB + UP than the QB + UP and the QB + FTLP (P < .01). The AP diameter changes at the umbilical level and the ML diameter changes at the xiphoid level were significantly larger during the PLB + FTLP than the QB + FTLP and the QB + UP (P < .05). The ML diameter changes at the umbilical level were significantly greater during the PLB + FTLP than the QB + UP (P < .05). However, no significant difference in the relative regional chest wall volumes and phase angle among the experimental tasks (P > .05). In conclusion, a combined PLB performed in an FTLP or UP sitting could be used as a strategy to improve chest wall volumes and ventilation in older adults."

  "date": "2022 Apr",
  "abstract": "Forward head posture (FHP) is one of the most common postural deviations. Deep neck muscle imbalance of individuals with FHP is of primary concern in clinical rehabilitation. However, there is scarce quantitative research on changes in deep neck muscle length with the head moving forward. This study aimed to investigate changes in deep neck muscle length with different severity levels of FHP. Six Thiel-embalmed cadavers (four males and two females) were dissected, and 16 deep neck muscles in each cadaver were modeled by a MicroScribe 3D Digitizer in the neutral head posture, slight FHP, and severe FHP. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate the degrees of FHP. Quantitative length change of the deep neck muscles was analyzed using Rhinoceros 3D. In slight FHP significant changes in length occurred in four muscles: two shortened (upper semispinalis capitis, rectus capitis posterior minor) and two lengthened (longus capitis, splenius cervicis). In severe FHP all occipital extensors were significantly shortened (10.6 ± 6.4%), except for obliquus capitis superior, and all cervical extensors were significantly lengthened (4.8 ± 3.4%), while longus capitis (occipital flexor) and the superior oblique part of the longus colli (cervical flexor) were lengthened by 8.8 ± 3.8% and 4.2 ± 3.1%, respectively. No significant length change was observed for the axial rotator. This study presents an alternate anatomical insight into the clinical rehabilitation of FHP. Six muscles appear to be important in restoring optimal head posture, with improvements in FHP being related to interventions associated with the occipital and cervical extensors."

  "date": "2022 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Many people with Parkinson disease (PD) experience freezing of gait (FoG), a transient gait disturbance associated with increased fall risk and reduced quality of life. Head-mounted virtual reality (VR) systems allow overground walking and can create immersive simulations of physical environments that induce FoG.\nResearch question: For people with PD who experience FoG (PD+FoG), are kinematic gait changes observed in VR simulations of FoG-provoking environments?\nMethods: In a cross-sectional experiment, people with PD+FoG walked at their self-selected speed in a physical laboratory and virtual laboratory, doorway, and hallway environments. Motion analysis assessed whole-body kinematics, including lower extremity joint excursions, swing phase toe clearance, trunk flexion, arm swing, sagittal plane inclination angle, and spatiotemporal characteristics. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine the effects of environment on gait variables, with planned contrasts between laboratory environments and the virtual doorway and hallway.\nResults: Twelve participants with PD+FoG (mean age [standard deviation]=72.8 [6.5] years, disease duration=8.8 [8.9] years, 3 females) completed the protocol. The environment had significant and widespread effects on kinematic and spatiotemporal variables. Compared to the physical laboratory, reduced joint excursions were observed in the ankle, knee, and hip when walking in the virtual doorway and in the knee and hip when walking in the virtual hallway. In both the virtual doorway and hallway compared to the physical laboratory, peak swing phase toe clearance, arm swing, and inclination angle were reduced, and walking was slower, with shorter, wider steps.\nSignificance: Virtual doorway and hallway environments induced kinematic changes commonly associated with FoG episodes, and these kinematic changes are consistent with forward falls that are common during FoG episodes. Combined with the flexibility of emerging VR technology, this research supports the potential of VR applications designed to improve the understanding, assessment, and treatment of FoG."

  "date": "2022 Apr",
  "abstract": "Background: A 60-year-old female patient reported with a chief complaint of pain in bilateral temporomandibular joints (TMJ) region since 11/2 years. The pain was initially reported to be insidious in onset, moderate in intensity, aggravated on chewing food and during excessive mouth opening. On examination her mouth opening was found to be less than 8 mm and standard head and neck examination showed grade 2 tenderness with swelling on bilateral TMJ and forward neck posture with rounded shoulders. The patient reported her pain to be 6 at rest in NPRS (with 0 being no pain and 10 being maximum) and 8 out of 10 on mouth opening.\nMethodology/management: A 4-week Physiotherapy Intervention program, which consisted of Ultrasound Therapy at varying intensity, TMJ manipulation, Cervical Range of Motion Exercises and Manual Cervical traction was administered. Repeated evaluation of pain and other functional outcomes were done on a weekly basis.\nResults: There was significant improvement in her mouth opening (41 mm), restoration of masticatory functions, complete resolution of pain and overall improvement in quality of life after the 4 weeks intervention program.\nConclusion: A structured Physiotherapy intervention program consisting of Non-thermal Ultrasound, Manipulation and exercise targeting TMJ and Upper quarter, proved to be highly effective in increasing functions and reducing signs and symptoms in Chronic TMJ Dysfunction which can be highly disabling. The recovery observed in this patient, who was not on any standard treatment for almost 18 months, hence the severe limitations she encountered, is a testament to the need of designing individualized treatment protocols addressing the many facets of impairment in TMJ Disorders."

  "title": "Comparisons of cervical and thoracic spine kinematic joint and body segment angles, timing, and velocity between individuals with and without chronic idiopathic neck pain during functional tasks",
  "date": "2022 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Few studies comprehensively analyse 3D neck kinematics in individuals with chronic idiopathic neck pain during functional tasks considered challenging. This critical knowledge is needed to assist clinicians to recognise and address how altered movement strategies might contribute to pain.\nResearch question: Are there differences in 3D neck kinematics (angles, timing, velocity) during functional tasks in people with chronic neck pain compared to matched asymptomatic control participants?\nMethods: Participants with chronic idiopathic neck pain (n = 33) and matched asymptomatic controls (n = 30) performed four functional tasks (overhead reach forward, right and left, and putting on a seatbelt) while evaluated using 3D motion capture. Kinematic variables included joint angles, range of motion (ROM,°), velocity (m s-1) and timing (% of movement phase) for joint angles (head-neck [HN joint], head+neck-upper trunk [HNT], and thoracolumbar) and segments (head, neck, head+neck [HN segment], upper trunk, and trunk. Generalised linear mixed models examined between-group differences.\nResults: There were few between-group differences. The neck pain group had less HN segment extension that controls (mean difference [MD] left -2.06°; 95% CI -3.82, -0.29; p = .023; and right reach -2.52°; -4.67, -0.37; P = .022), and had less total sagittal HNT ROM across all tasks (-1.28; 95% CI -2.25, -0.31; p = .010). Approaching significance was the pain group having less thoracolumbar left rotation than controls (MD -2.14, 95% CI -4.41 to 0.13, p = .064). The pain group had higher neck segment peak flexion velocity than controls across all tasks (MD -3.09; 95% CI -5.21 to -0.10; P = .004). Timing of joint angle peaks did not differ between groups.\nSignificance: When performing an overhead reach task to the left and right and putting on a seatbelt, people with neck pain maintain a more flexed HN segment, use less sagittal ROM and have higher velocity peaks. These findings can assist clinicians in their assessment of patients by identifying possible underlying contributors to neck pain."

  "title": "The effects of body direction and posture on taking the perspective of a humanoid avatar in a virtual environment",
  "date": "2021 Dec 21",
  "abstract": "Visual perspective taking is inferring how the world looks to another person. To clarify this process, we investigated whether employing a humanoid avatar as the viewpoint would facilitate an imagined perspective shift in a virtual environment, and which factor of the avatar is effective for the facilitation effect. We used a task that involved reporting how an object looks by a simple direction judgment, either from the avatar's position or from the position of an empty chair. We found that the humanoid avatar's presence improved task performance. Furthermore, the avatar's facilitation effect was observed only when the avatar was facing the visual stimulus to be judged; performance was worse when it faced backwards than when there was only an empty chair facing forwards. This suggests that the avatar does not simply attract spatial attention, but the posture of the avatar is crucial for the facilitation effect. In addition, when the directions of the head and the torso were opposite (i.e., an impossible posture), the avatar's facilitation effect disappeared. Thus, visual perspective taking might not be facilitated by the avatar when its posture is biomechanically impossible because we cannot embody it. Finally, even when the avatar's head of the possible posture was covered with a bucket, the facilitation effect was found with the forward-facing avatar rather than the backward-facing avatar. That is, the head/gaze direction cue, or presumably the belief that the visual stimulus to be judged can be seen by the avatar, was not required. These results suggest that explicit perspective taking is facilitated by embodiment towards humanoid avatars."

  "date": "2023 Mar",
  "abstract": "Objectives. This study aimed to investigate the presence of scapular dyskinesis (SD) in office workers with neck and scapular complaints. The postural malalignment and related muscle adaptations were also explored. Methods. SD and its subtypes were determined. Postural deviations and the length of commonly reported muscle tightness were evaluated. Results. Among 99 participants, 90% of them had SD. Considering both sides or 198 scapula, 90.4% were identified as having painful scapula and 19% as having painless scapula. There was a difference in the proportion of SD on painful (93%) and painless (69%) sides. Postural deviations including rounded shoulder (100%), forward head (43.3%) and thoracic hyperkyphosis (54.5%) were prevalent. Persons with type III SD had a higher percentage of forward head than other types. There was also tightness of the pectoralis minor (100%), levator scapulae (93.0%) and upper trapezius (98.3%) muscles without different proportions among types of SD. The greatest proportion of persons with SD had tightness of the levator scapulae. Conclusions. There was a high prevalence of SD among office workers with neck and scapular complaints. SD was also associated with abnormal posture and muscle tightness. The proper management of SD and working posture is warranted."

  "title": "Deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nuclei alters postural alignment and adaptation in Parkinson's disease",
  "date": "2021 Dec 14",
  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) can produce postural abnormalities of the standing body position such as kyphosis. We investigated the effects of PD, deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), vision and adaptation on body position in a well-defined group of patients with PD in quiet standing and during balance perturbations. Ten patients with PD and 25 young and 17 old control participants were recruited. Body position was measured with 3D motion tracking of the ankle, knee, hip, shoulder and head. By taking the ankle as reference, we mapped the position of the joints during quiet standing and balance perturbations through repeated calf muscle vibration. We did this to explore the effect of PD, DBS in the STN, and vision on the motor learning process of adaptation in response to the repeated stimulus. We found that patients with PD adopt a different body position with DBS ON vs. DBS OFF, to young and old controls, and with eyes open vs. eyes closed. There was an altered body position in PD with greater flexion of the head, shoulder and knee (p≤0.042) and a posterior position of the hip with DBS OFF (p≤0.014). With DBS ON, body position was brought more in line with the position taken by control participants but there was still evidence of greater flexion at the head, shoulder and knee. The amplitude of movement during the vibration period decreased in controls at all measured sites with eyes open and closed (except at the head in old controls with eyes open) showing adaptation which contrasted the weaker adaptive responses in patients with PD. Our findings suggest that alterations of posture and greater forward leaning with repeated calf vibration, are independent from reduced movement amplitude changes. DBS in the STN can significantly improve body position in PD although the effects are not completely reversed. Patients with PD maintain adaptive capabilities by leaning further forward and reducing movement amplitude despite their kyphotic posture."

  "title": "Posture of Adolescent and the Relationship with Body Mass Index, Sex, and Physical Activity",
  "date": "2022 Jul",
  "abstract": "Background: The increase in overweight and the physical inactivity in children and adolescents in the last years have been causing constant concerns. The comprehension of the postural patterns contributes to the prevention of postural deviations that could predispose to future pain and disabilities. The aim of this study was to assess the association between posture, sex, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity to understand the relationship of these factors with the posture of adolescents. Methods: We evaluated 217 adolescents of both sexes between 11 and 15 years of age who were students in municipal schools in São Paulo. The posture was assessed by photogrammetry, Foot Posture Index, Flexicurve, and the Scoliometer®. Physical activity was evaluated by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children and Adolescent. Results: The group of adolescents with obesity presented a higher angle of lumbar lordosis and the overweight group showed greater anteriorization of the head when compared with the group with normal weight. The females presented greater head anteriorization, Q angle and lumbar lordosis, and the males presented greater projection of the trunk and body forward. The group with sedentary habits showed greater abduction of the scapulae. Conclusions: We concluded that BMI and sex had the highest relationship with the posture of adolescents. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between physical activity and posture. Our results may assist future studies and support preventive and therapeutic actions in the treatment of adolescents' postural changes."

  "date": "2021 Sep 1",
  "abstract": "Objectives: This study aims to investigate how exercise programs not directly applied to the cervical spine affect office workers with forward head posture (FHP).\nPatients and methods: Between March 2018 and June 2018, a total of 32 office workers with FHP (13 males, 19 females; mean age 36.63 years; range, 23 to 57 years) were randomized either to experimental (n=16) or control groups (n=16). Scapular stabilization and thoracic extension exercises were applied to the experimental group and cervical stabilization and stretching exercises to the control group. The results of the pre-intervention and after six weeks measurement of the craniovertebral angle (CVA), respiration, pain, and disability were compared and analyzed.\nResults: For intra-group comparison, both groups showed significant differences (p<0.05) in CVA, forced expiratory volume at 1 sec (FEV1), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and neck disability index at pre- and post-intervention, while only the experimental group showed a significant difference (p<0.05) in maximum inspiratory pressure, maximum expiratory pressure, and forced vital capacity. For inter-group comparison, a significant difference (p<0.05) between FEV1 and VAS was observed.\nConclusion: The combination of scapular stabilization and thoracic extension exercises, not directly applied to the cervical spine, has an effect on improving the posture, respiration, neck pain, and disability in office workers with FHP."

  "title": "Walking Biomechanics and Spine Loading in Patients With Symptomatic Lumbar Spinal Stenosis",
  "date": "2021 Nov 18",
  "abstract": "Symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis is a leading cause of pain and mobility limitation in older adults. It is clinically believed that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis adopt a flexed trunk posture or bend forward and alter their gait pattern to improve tolerance for walking. However, a biomechanical assessment of spine posture and motion during walking is broadly lacking in these patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate lumbar spine and pelvic sagittal angles and lumbar spine compressive loads in standing and walking and to determine the effect of pain and neurogenic claudication symptoms in patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Seven participants with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis, aged 44-82, underwent a 3D opto-electronic motion analysis during standing and walking trials in asymptomatic and symptomatic states. Passive reflective marker clusters (four markers each) were attached to participants at T1, L1, and S2 levels of the spine, with additional reflective markers at other spinal levels, as well as the head, pelvis, and extremities. Whole-body motion data was collected during standing and walking trials in asymptomatic and symptomatic states. The results showed that the spine was slightly flexed during walking, but this was not affected by symptoms. Pelvic tilt was not different when symptoms were present, but suggests a possible effect of more forward tilt in both standing (p = 0.052) and walking (p = 0.075). Lumbar spine loading during symptomatic walking was increased by an average of 7% over asymptomatic walking (p = 0.001). Our results did not show increased spine flexion (adopting a trunk-flexed posture) and only indicate a trend for a small forward shift of the pelvis during both symptomatic walking and standing. This suggests that provocation of symptoms in these patients does not markedly affect their normal gait kinematics. The finding of increased spine loading with provocation of symptoms supports our hypothesis that spine loading plays a role in limiting walking function in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, but additional work is needed to understand the biomechanical cause of this increase."

  "abstract": "Background: The influence of the stomatognatic system on human posture control has been investigated under static conditions, but the effects on dynamic balance have not yet been considered.\nObjective: Investigating the influence of different functional stomatognatic activities (jaw clenching (JAW), tongue pressing (TON) and habitual jaw position (HAB)) on postural performance during a dynamic reactive balance task.\nMethods: Forty-eight physically active and healthy adults were assigned to three groups differing in oral-motor tasks (JAW, TON or HAB). Dynamic reactive balance was assessed by an oscillating platform which was externally perturbed in four directions. Performance was quantified by means of Lehr's damping ratio. Mean speeds of the selected anatomical regions (head, trunk, pelvis, knee and foot) were analysed to determine significant performance differences.\nResults: The groups differed significantly in balance performance in direction F (i.e., forwards acceleration of the platform). Post hoc tests revealed that the JAW group had significantly better performance compared with both the HAB and TON groups. Better performance was associated with a decreased mean speed of the analysed anatomical regions.\nConclusion: JAW can improve dynamic reactive balance but the occurrence of positive effects seems to be task-specific and not general. TON seems not to have any observable effects on dynamic reactive balance performance, at least when evaluating it with an oscillating platform. JAW might be a valuable strategy which could possibly reduce the risk of falls in elderly people; however, further investigations are still needed."

  "title": "Postural Balance in Individuals With Knee Osteoarthritis During Stand-to-Sit Task",
  "date": "2021 Nov 3",
  "abstract": "Objective: Stand-to-sit task is an important daily function, but there is a lack of research evidence on whether knee osteoarthritis (knee OA) affects the postural balance during the task. This study aimed to compare individuals with knee OA and asymptomatic controls in postural balance and identify kinematic and lower extremity muscle activity characteristics in individuals with knee OA during the stand-to-sit task. Methods: In total, 30 individuals with knee OA and 30 age-matched asymptomatic controls performed the 30-s Chair Stand Test (30sCST) at self-selected speeds. Motion analysis data and surface electromyography (sEMG) were collected while participants performed the 30sCST. To quantify postural balance, the displacement of the center of mass (CoM) and the peak instantaneous velocity of the CoM were calculated. The kinematic data included forward lean angles of the trunk and pelvic, range of motion (RoM) of the hip, knee, and ankle joints in the sagittal plane. The averaged activation levels of gluteus maximus, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, rectus femoris, biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), and medial head of gastrocnemius muscles were indicated by the normalized root mean square amplitudes. Results: Compared with the asymptomatic control group, the knee OA group prolonged the duration of the stand-to-sit task, demonstrated significantly larger CoM displacement and peak instantaneous CoM velocity in the anterior-posterior direction, reduced ankle dorsiflexion RoM, greater anterior pelvic tilt RoM, and lower quadriceps femoris and muscles activation level coupled with higher BF muscle activation level during the stand-to-sit task. Conclusion: This study indicates that individuals with knee OA adopt greater pelvic forward lean RoM and higher BF muscle activation level during the stand-to-sit task. However, these individuals exist greater CoM excursion in the anterior-posterior direction and take more time to complete the task. This daily functional activity should be added to the rehabilitation goals for individuals with knee OA. The knee OA group performs reduced ankle dorsiflexion RoM, quadriceps femoris, and TA activation deficit. In the future, the rehabilitation programs targeting these impairments could be beneficial for restoring the functional transfer in individuals with knee OA."

  "abstract": "Background: Abnormal posture creates abnormal stress and strain in many spinal structures which are considered predisposing factors for chronic mechanical low back pain.\nPurpose: To examine the relationships among pain intensity, forward head posture (decreased craniovertebral angle) and lumbopelvic sagittal alignment (pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, sacral slope, and lumbar lordosis) in chronic mechanical low back pain patients.\nMethods: A cross-section correlational study was conducted on one hundred patients. A numerical-pain-rating scale was used to determine pain intensity. Standardized standing lateral radiographs were analyzed to measure the spinopelvic angles. Reported data were analyzed using correlation coefficients, and regression analyses.\nResults: Lumbar lordosis had very strong positive correlations with each pain intensity and sacral slope. Pain intensity had a strong positive correlation with sacral slope. Moderate positive correlations highlighted between pelvic tilt and craniovertebral angle. Moreover, the pelvic incidence had weak positive correlations with each sacral slope and pelvic tilt. Negative correlations were strong between pelvic tilt and each of pain intensity, lumbar lordosis and sacral slope. Craniovertebral angle had moderate negative correlations with each of pain, lumbar lordosis, and sacral slope. However, the pelvic incidence had no relations with pain, craniovertebral angle lumbar lordosis. Overall, an association of demographic data and measured variables had a significant effect on the pain multi-regression equation prediction model. They accounted for 76.60% of the variation in pain.\nConclusion: Abnormal spinopelvic posture relates to chronic mechanical low back pain. There are significant associations among pain intensity, FHP and lumbopelvic sagittal alignment in chronic mechanical low back pain patients."

Spiral tomographic intensity-modulated radiotherapy has the many advantages of precision radiotherapy, which puts forward high requirements for postural reproducibility and accuracy. We will aim to ensure that the accurate positioning of the tumour will reduce the side effects of radiotherapy caused by positioning errors. We will design and implement this clinical trial using the patent of 'a radiotherapy oral fixation and parameter acquisition device (patent number: ZL201921877986.5)'.\nMethods and analysis: This will be a randomised, controlled, prospective study with 120 patients with head and neck tumours. Using the random number table method, a random number sequence will be generated, and the patients will be enrolled in the experimental group (oral fixation device) and the control group (conventional fixation) in a 2:1 ratio. The primary outcome will be the progression-free survival time after the treatment. Secondary outcomes will include the oral mucosal reaction and the quality of life. Follow-ups will be carried out according to the plan. This is V.1.0 of protocol on 1 April 2021. The recruitment process for this clinical trial commenced on 1 May 2021, and will end on 1 October 2022.\nEthics and dissemination: The trial received ethical approval from Medical Ethics Committee of Liaoning Provincial Cancer Hospital (number 20210131X).

  "abstract": "Objectives: In most cases, suspension laryngoscopy (SL) is efficient, bloodless and with minimal post-procedure discomfort. We aimed to identify predictive patient factors for acceptable surgical views at SL as well as quantify our tertiary airway unit's complication rates.\nDesign: Prospective cohort study of 150 consecutive microlaryngoscopy procedures involving SL over an 8-month period between November 2019 and July 2020. Patients were assessed preoperatively for pre-existing oral, temporomandibular, dental, pharyngeal or laryngeal pathology, interincisor distance and qualitative gross limitations to neck extension and forward head posture. Intraoperatively, the laryngoscopic view was graded by anaesthetic and surgical teams, and complications were recorded on patient interview in recovery.\nSetting: Tertiary adult airway service for predominantly benign pathology.\nResults: Adequate surgical views were obtained in 149/150 procedures. BMI had a weak positive correlation with a more difficult view (r = .22, p = .008) but did not correlate with a statistically significant increase in any complication. There was a weak negative correlation between age and interincisor gap (r = -.20, p = .014), and wider mouth opening correlated very weakly with a lower incidence of sore throat (r = -.19, p = .023). Gross macroglossia showed a significant moderate positive correlation with tongue symptoms (r = .45, p = 1.611 × 10-8 ).\nConclusion: In the context of an experienced airway unit with a high caseload of predominantly benign pathology, SL is very effective and safe with low associated morbidity and no mortality. The most common complication of SL is temporary sore throat and there remain recognised risks of temporary tongue and dental symptoms."

  "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to reveal the relationship between degenerative changes in the cervical spine, head and neck postures, neck pain, and bone mineral density (BMD) of the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine in post-menopausal females. In total, 116 females (mean age 60.4 ± 7.1 years; age range 50-80 years) were included. Participants were classified into three groups based on the T-score criteria of the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine set by World Health Organization, respectively. The degree of neck pain was assessed using self-administered questionnaire, the Neck Disability Index. Cervical spine degeneration and head and neck postures were identified using the lateral cephalograms. Grading system for cervical degeneration included three categories of the radiographic alterations including disc height loss, osteophyte formation, and diffuse sclerosis. The areal BMD of the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine were determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Females with lower BMD exhibited lesser degree of neck pain and forward head posture (FHP) compared to those with normal BMD. Higher BMD seemed to be associated with more notable loss of the disc height at the level of C4-5. More prominent degenerative changes in the cervical spine were associated with higher areal BMD of the hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine, altered head posture, and development of neck pain."

  "date": "2022 Mar/Apr",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Older adults with age-related hearing loss (ARHL) are at greater risk of falling and have greater mobility problems than older adults with normal hearing (NH). The underlying cause of these associations remains unclear. One possible reason is that age-related declines in the vestibular system could parallel those observed in the auditory system within the same individuals. Here, we compare the sensitivity of vestibular perceptual abilities (psychophysics), vestibular end-organ functioning (vestibular evoked myogenic potentials and video head impulse tests), and standing balance (posturography) in healthy older adults with and without ARHL.\nDesign: A total of 46 community-dwelling older adults, 23 with ARHL and 23 with NH, were passively translated in heave (up and down) and rotated in pitch (tilted forward and backward) in the dark using a motion platform. Using an adaptive staircase psychophysical procedure, participants' heave and pitch detection and discrimination thresholds were determined. In a posturography task, participants' center of pressure (COP) path length was measured as they stood on a forceplate with eyes open and closed, on firm and compliant surfaces, with and without sound suppression. Baseline motor, cognitive, and sensory functioning, including vestibular end-organ function, were measured.\nResults: Individuals with ARHL were less sensitive at discriminating pitch movements compared to older adults with NH. Poorer self-reported hearing abilities were also associated with poorer pitch discrimination. In addition to pitch discrimination thresholds, lower pitch detection thresholds were significantly associated with hearing loss in the low-frequency range. Less stable standing balance was significantly associated with poorer vestibular perceptual sensitivity.\nDiscussion: These findings provide evidence for an association between ARHL and reduced vestibular perceptual sensitivity."

  "title": "Odds ratios for reclined seating positions in real-world crashes",
  "date": "2021 Oct",
  "abstract": "It is widely believed that with higher levels of vehicle automation and especially with the advent of fully automatic vehicles, the currently typical forward-facing, upright position will give way to a more relaxed and reclined seating posture. Therefore, the current study investigates the influence of a reclined sitting position on crash injury severity by analyzing real-world crash data from the German in-depth accident study (GIDAS). We compared reclined to upright occupants and focused on effect sizes regarding odds ratios at different injury severity levels. We used the abbreviated injury scale (AIS 2015) for injury scaling and the maximum AIS (MAIS) at the levels 2+, 3+, and 4+ to convert injury severity into a dichotomous metric. Two different analyses were conducted, one looking at the occupant MAIS and one focusing on selected body regions. The body regions investigated are head/face/neck (HFN), thorax, abdomen, pelvis/hip/lower extremities (PHL), and upper extremities. We computed odds ratios greater than one indicating a higher odds of injury at a given injury severity level in the reclined group compared to the upright group. The odds ratios for belted, reclined occupants compared to belted, upright sitting occupants are 2.07, 3.09, and 3.66 for the injury severity levels MAIS2+, MAIS3+, and MAIS4+, respectively. When looking at the body regions, the spread of the odds ratios is wider: At the MAIS2+ level, the odds ratios range between 1.6 and 7.1; at the MAIS3+ level, the odds ratios span from 1.5 to 8.7, with the latter value representing the PHL region. No odds ratio could be computed for the upper extremity injuries at this level. At the MAIS4+ injury severity level, only the HFN odds ratio was statistically significant with a value of 5.6. This study is among the first to show an association between body posture and injury severity at MAIS3+ and MAIS4+ injury level in real-world crashes for reclined seating postures."

  "title": "Focus on the Scapular Region in the Rehabilitation of Chronic Neck Pain Is Effective in Improving the Symptoms: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "date": "2021 Aug 8",
  "abstract": "Chronic neck pain is a common human health problem. Changes in scapular posture and alteration of muscle activation patterns of scapulothoracic muscles are cited as potential risk factors for neck pain. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of neck exercise training (NET) with and without scapular stabilization training (SST) on pain intensity, the scapula downward rotation index (SDRI), forward head angle (FHA) and neck range of motion (ROM) in patients with chronic neck pain and scapular dyskinesia. A total of sixty-six subjects with chronic neck pain and scapular dyskinesia were randomly divided into three groups: neck exercise training, n = 24, combined training (NET + SST), n = 24 and a control group, n = 24. Pain intensity, SDRI, FHA and ROM were measured by the numerical rating scale, caliper, photogrammetry and IMU sensor, respectively. When the combined intervention group consisting of NET and SST was compared with NET alone at six weeks, there was a statistically significant difference in pain intensity, SDRI, FHA and cervical ROM for flexion and extension (p ≤ 0.05). Adding scapular exercises to neck exercises had a more significant effect in decreasing pain intensity, SDRI, FHA and increased cervical ROM than neck exercises alone in patients with chronic neck pain. These findings indicate that focus on the scapular posture in the rehabilitation of chronic neck pain effectively improves the symptoms."

  "title": "[Correlation between neck pressure pain threshold and forward head posture in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders]",
  "date": "2021 Aug 9",
  "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the association between neck muscles pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and forward head posture (FHP) in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Methods: A total of 145 TMD patients, including 23 males and 122 females with a median age of 28 years, were enrolled in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine from December 2019 to April 2020. Informations of FHP and neck muscles PPT were collected for all participants. FHP was characterized by the craniocervical angle (CVA) between C7, the tragus of the ear and the horizontal line. Each of the participants completed a questionaire of the neck disability index (NDI). The patients with CVA≤51 ° were asigned into FHP group, otherwise the patients with CVA>51° were asigned into non-FHP group. PPT were measured at the midpoint of the upper trapezius and 1 cm aside from C5-C6 articular pillars. Nonparametric test and Spearman correlation analysis were conducted for the data analysis. Results: There were 70 patients in the FHP group and 75 patients in the non-FHP group. The trapezius PPT of the FHP group [2.82(0.86) kg] was significantly higher than that of the non-FHP group [2.46(0.80) kg] (P<0.01). No significant differences in PPT and NDI were observed between the two groups (P>0.05). Low correlation was found between trapezius PPT and FHP negatively (r=-0.273, P<0.01) and no correlation was found between C5-C6 PPT and FHP (r=-0.124, P>0.05). PPT in trapezius and C5-C6 was negatively correlated with NDI in moderate (r=-0.301, P<0.01) and low (r=-0.206, P<0.05) levels. Conclusions: The trapezius PPT was correlated with FHP negatively. The more FHP, the more pain tolerant of trapezius muscles. There was no correlation between neck function and FHP directly. The higher threshold was followed by better neck function."

  "date": "2021 Jul",
  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 4 weeks of sling-based manual therapy on the cervicothoracic junction (CTJ) area in patients with neck pain and forward head posture.\nDesign: Single-blind randomized controlled trial.\nSetting: Outpatient, Chonbuk National University hospital, Republic of Korea.\nSubjects: A total of 22 participants with neck pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale >3) and forward head posture (craniovertebral angle <51) were randomly assigned to a CTJ group or a control group (n = 11 each).\nIntervention: In the control group, joint mobilization and motor control training was applied for the upper cervical spine (C0-C1). The CTJ group applied the same intervention to the upper cervical spine and cervicothoracic junction (C7-T3).\nMain measures: Numeric pain rating scale and neck disability index, craniovertebral angle, active range of motion, and muscle activity were evaluated before and after 4 weeks of intervention.\nResult: The CTJ group participants showed significant improvement in the craniovertebral angle and cervical extension range after the intervention than the control group (P = 0.025, P = 0.001). While both groups presented significant differences after the intervention regarding Numeric pain rating scale, neck disability index, and muscle activity (sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene muscle), there were no statistically significant differences between the groups (P > 0.05).\nConclusion: Our results suggest that the CTJ and the upper cervical region in patients with neck pain and forward head posture represent an area which if approached by manual therapy, improves cervical mobility and posture."

Skeletal class measured by the Steiner method. Postural analysis through APECS mobile application for forward head posture and shoulder discrepancy, and surface electromyography with Biopac® device.\nResults: The skeletal class, forward head posture, and shoulder discrepancy presented statistical association with the symmetrical electromyographic response of digastric muscles and masseter muscles during swallowing.\nDiscussion: This study exhibited a positive relationship between digastric muscle symmetry and skeletal class during swallowing. The compensation of the hyoid system explains these results, showing that skeletal Class III has better electromyographic balance. In contrast, masseter muscle symmetry during swallowing presented a negative relationship with skeletal class. The stabilization role that this muscle plays during swallowing explains these findings, caused by the different lengths and direction of this muscle in skeletal Class III."

  "abstract": "Background: The excessive use of hand-held mobile devices (HHMD) leads to a postural phenomenon known as text neck.\nObjective: The aim of this paper is to discuss the anatomical, biomechanical and muscle activation changes within the cervical and thoracic regions associated with the sustained, forward, flexed neck posture, observed with excessive usage of hand-held mobile devices. Additionally, this paper examines the relationship of gender, as well as the effects of carrying backpack loads by youth, on this forward, flexed neck posture.\nMethods: Multiple aspects of the text neck position that occur when an individual uses a HHMD are described.\nResults: Prolonged use of hand-held mobile devices results in adverse anatomical and biomechanical changes in the cervical and thoracic spine, muscular imbalances, and postural compensations, all of which contribute to muscular overuse and fatigue resulting in pain.\nConclusions: Physical therapists must educate their patients about proper posture while using hand-held mobile devices. Proper posture includes: holding the device close to eye level, using the device while standing or sitting and holding the device with a line of sight perpendicular to the surface of the device, using a larger screen, and texting with both hands. Also, because children are using hand held mobile devices at younger ages, parents and teachers must be educated about the dangers of prolonged use of hand-held devices."

  "date": "2022 Mar",
  "abstract": "Introduction: The purpose of the present study is to compare the effect of the physiotherapy to onabolulinumtoxin-A, and their combination, in relation to cervical and headache parameters in patients with chronic migraine.\nMethods: This is an observational cohort study conducted by a headache center and a physiotherapy degree course on 30 patients with chronic migraine. The patients were distributed in three groups of treatments for three months: onabolulinumtoxin-A only, physiotherapy only, and onabolulinumtoxin-A plus physiotherapy. The patients were evaluated, before and after each treatment, using the following: the postural assessment software SAPO for the forward head posture; the CROM goniometer for the cervical range of motion; the Migraine Disability Assessment Score for headache parameters.\nResults: After 3 months of each treatment, the scores obtained for the headache-related disability and the frequency of migraine decreased significantly for all groups, but the pain intensity scores changed significantly only in the onabolulinumtoxin-A (p = 0.01) and in the onabolulinumtoxin-A plus physiotherapy groups (p = 0.007). On the other hand, the forward head posture was reduced significantly in the physiotherapy (p = 0.002) and in the onabolulinumtoxin-A plus physiotherapy groups (p = 0.003). The cervical range of motion increased significantly in certain directions in the physiotherapy group and in the onabolulinumtoxin-A plus physiotherapy groups.\nConclusions: The physiotherapy improved the cervical parameters. The onabolulinumtoxin-A decreased pain intensity. As a consequence, it can be said that the combined treatment was more useful than a mono-therapy alone. From our results, it can be concluded that onabolulinumtoxin-A plus physiotherapy could be a good option in the management of chronic migraine."

  "title": "Anomalous Gait Feature Classification From 3-D Motion Capture Data",
  "date": "2022 Feb",
  "abstract": "The gait kinematics of an individual is affected by various factors, including age, anthropometry, gender, and disease. Detecting anomalous gait features aids in the diagnosis and treatment of gait-related diseases. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning method for automatically classifying five anomalous gait features, i.e., toe-out, genu varum, pes planus, hindfoot valgus, and forward head posture features, from three-dimensional data on gait kinematics. Gait data and gait feature labels of 488 subjects were acquired. The orientations of the human body segments during a gait cycle were mapped to a low-dimensional latent gait vector using a variational autoencoder. A two-layer neural network was trained to classify five gait features using logistic regression and calculate an anomalous gait feature vector (AGFV). The proposed network showed balanced accuracies of 82.8% for a toe-out, 85.9% for hindfoot valgus, 80.2% for pes planus, 73.2% for genu varum, and 92.9% for forward head posture when the AGFV was rounded to the nearest zero or 1. Multiple anomalous gait features were detectable using the proposed method, which has a practical advantage over current gait indices, including the gait deviation index with a single value. The overall results confirmed the feasibility of using the proposed method for screening subjects with anomalous gait features using three-dimensional motion capture data."

  "title": "Posture and Muscle Activity during Waste Collection Work",
  "date": "2022 Jan 7",
  "abstract": "The musculoskeletal load in waste collection has been examined through simulated assessment of pulling and pushing bins as well as lifting and throwing rubbish bags. With the onset of mechanization, many of these tasks do not exist and workers are faced with other loads not previously assessed. The purpose of this study was to quantify the postures and muscle activity during mechanized waste collection work. Three subtasks of mechanized waste collection were identified, namely driving, bin collection, and egress and access of the vehicle. Spinal, shoulder, and upper limb kinematics along with surface electromyography from three muscles were collected during these tasks in a typical work shift. During driving and bin collection, participants adopted a head-extended, torso forward-flexed posture with frequent rotations of the head and neck. Egress and access of the vehicle produced substantially larger ranges of movement compared with driving and bin collection. The forward-flex, sitting posture can increase the risk of low back pain if there are undulations in the terrain and if this posture is adopted for prolonged periods. The frequent head and neck rotations can increase the incidence and severity of neck pain. Prolonged driving has been linked with an increased cardiometabolic risk and egress and access has increased risk of trips and falls from a height. Managers of waste collection workers should consider implementing interventions to reduce the exposure of this important workforce to the deleterious demands of their work."

  "title": "Inter and Intra-Rater Reliability of Measuring Photometric Craniovertebral Angle Using a Cloud-Based Video Communication Platform",
  "date": "2021 Jun 22",
  "abstract": "Objective: Due to social distancing guidelines during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, most providers and patients have wanted to avoid close contact. This makes physical therapy (PT) assessments difficult because of the lack of empirical evidence about the reliability of various clinical measurements performed in a virtual environment. One such procedure is the photometric measurement of craniovertebral (CV) angle. Craniovertebral angle measurement is usually performed in an outpatient setting and is defined as the acute angle formed between a straight line connecting the spinous process of C7 to the tragus of the ear, and the horizontal line passing through the spinous process of the C7. Although the photometric measurement of CV angles is considered both valid and reliable in the clinics, no empirical evidence exists about the CV angle measurement reliability when performed in a virtual environment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the inter- and intra-rater reliability of photometric CV angle measurement using a cloud-based video communication platform. Number of Subjects: 66 subjects (57 females).\nMethods: All measurements were performed by two final year PT students who had completed the musculoskeletal part of the curriculum and were blinded to each other's measurements. Each subject was photographed in two postures over a HIPAA-compliant video-based telehealth platform: (1) normal/relaxed posture and (2) ideal posture (posture the subject considered good). Student researcher 1 measured the CV angle in both the relaxed posture and ideal posture, while student researcher 2 measured the CV angle only in the relaxed posture. Each subject's CV angle measurement was performed three times on three separate days and the means were used for further analysis. The shape of the CV angle frequency distribution was assessed using kurtosis and skewness values. Rater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and interpreted based on the guidelines provided by Portney and Watkins (2009).\nResults: The CV angles were normally distributed in both relaxed and ideal postures. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of relaxed posture was 50.7o ± 6.3o with kurtosis and skewness of 0.67 and -0.74 respectively. The mean and SD of ideal posture was 55.5o ± 5.4o, with kurtosis and skewness of 0.1 and -0.54 respectively. The ICC for inter-rater reliability in the relaxed posture was 0.88 and the ICC for intra-rater reliability for relaxed posture was 0.91.\nConclusions: Craniovertebral angles were normally distributed in the sample. An acceptable level of inter- and intra-rater reliability can be attained when measuring CV angle using a cloud-based video communication platform."

  "title": "Self-initiation Inhibits the Postural and Electrophysiological Responses to Optic Flow and Button Pressing",
  "date": "2021 Aug 21",
  "abstract": "As we move through our environment, our visual system is presented with optic flow, a potentially important cue for perception, navigation and postural control. How does the brain anticipate the optic flow that arises as a consequence of our own movement? Converging evidence suggests that stimuli are processed differently by the brain if occurring as a consequence of self-initiated actions, compared to when externally generated. However, this has mainly been demonstrated with auditory stimuli. It is not clear how this occurs with optic flow. We measured behavioural, neurophysiological and head motion responses of 29 healthy participants to radially expanding, vection-inducing optic flow stimuli, simulating forward transitional motion, which were either initiated by the participant's own button-press (\"self-initiated flow\") or by the computer (\"passive flow\"). Self-initiation led to a prominent and left-lateralized inhibition of the flow-evoked posterior event-related alpha desynchronization (ERD), and a stabilisation of postural responses. Neither effect was present in control button-press-only trials, without optic flow. Additionally, self-initiation also produced a large event-related potential (ERP) negativity between 130-170 ms after optic flow onset. Furthermore, participants' visual induced motion sickness (VIMS) and vection intensity ratings correlated positively across the group - although many participants felt vection in the absence of any VIMS, none reported the opposite combination. Finally, we found that the simple act of making a button press leads to a detectable head movement even when using a chin rest. Taken together, our results indicate that the visual system is capable of predicting optic flow when self-initiated, to affect behaviour."

  "title": "Mechanisms of mid-thoracic spine fracture/dislocation due to falls during horse racing: A report of two cases",
  "date": "2021 Nov",
  "abstract": "We reported two cases of jockeys who sustained fracture/dislocation of the mid-thoracic spine due to traumatic falls during horse racing. We examined the injury mechanism based upon the patients' diagnostic images and video footage of races, in which the accidents occurred. Admission imaging of patient 1 (a 42 years old male) revealed T5 burst fracture with bony retropulsion of 7 mm causing complete paralysis below T5/6. There existed 22° focal kyphosis at T5/6, anterolisthesis of T5 relative to T6, T5/6 disc herniation, cord edema and epidural hemorrhage from T4 through T6, and cord injury from C3 through C6. Admission imaging of patient 2 (a 23 years old male) revealed T4/5 fracture/dislocation causing incomplete paralysis below spinal level. There existed compression fractures at T5, T6, and T7; 4 mm anterior subluxation of T4 on T5; diffuse cord swelling from T3 through T5; comminuted fracture of the C1 right lateral mass; right frontal traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage; and extensive diffuse axonal injury. The injuries were caused by high energy flexion-compression of the mid-thoracic spine with a flexed posture upon impact. Our results suggest that substantially greater cord compression occurred transiently during trauma as compared to that documented from admission imaging. Video footage of the accidents indicated that the spine buckled and failed due to abrupt pocketing and deceleration of the head, neck and shoulders upon impact with the ground combined with continued forward and downward momentum of the torso and lower extremities. While a similar mechanism is well known to cause fracture/dislocation of the cervical spine, it is less common and less understood for mid-thoracic spine injuries. Our study provides insight into the etiology of fracture/dislocation patterns of the mid-thoracic spine due to falls during horse racing."

  "abstract": "Posture, a potentially modifiable injury risk factor, is considered important in injury screening/prevention in athletes, yet few studies investigate relationships between posture and injury. This prospective cohort study investigated whether static posture is associated with lower limb injury risk in male football players (n = 263). Nine aspects of static standing posture (left and right rearfoot, knee interspace, lateral knee, lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, scoliosis S and C, forward head) were assessed from photographs during the pre-season using the modified Watson and Mac Donncha scale, which was dichotomised for analysis (deviated or normal). Player characteristics (age, height, mass, body mass index, competition level), match/training exposure, and previous and in-season non-contact lower limb injuries were recorded. Binary logistic regression investigated relationships between posture and injury (previous and in-season). Eighty previous and 24 in-season lower limb injuries were recorded. Previous injury was not associated with any postural variable. In-season injury was associated with previous injury (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 1.20-7.68, p = 0.02) and having a normal thoracic curve compared to kyphosis (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-1.00, p = 0.05) but no other postural variables. Static postural deviations observed in male football players in the pre-season are not typically associated with non-contact lower limb injury risk; thus, they are unlikely to add value to pre-season screening programs."

  "abstract": "Background: The cranio-cervical flexion exercise and sub-occipital muscle inhibition technique have been used to improve a forward head posture among neck pain patients with straight leg raise (SLR) limitation. However, little is known about the cranio-vertebral angle (CVA) and cervical spine range of motion (CROM) after applying stretching methods to the hamstring muscle.\nObjective: To compare the immediate effects of static stretching and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching on SLR, CVA, and CROM in neck pain patients with hamstring tightness.\nMethods: 64 subjects were randomly allocated to the static stretching (n1= 32) or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (n2= 32) stretching group. The SLR test was performed to measure the hamstring muscle's flexibility and tightness between the two groups, with CROM and CVA also being measured. The paired t-test was used to compare all the variables within each group before and after the intervention. The independent t-test was used to compare the two groups before and after the stretching exercise.\nResults: There were no between-group effects for any outcome variables (P> 0.05). However, all SLR, CVA, and CROM outcome variables were significantly improved within-group (P< 0.05).\nConclusions: There were no between-group effects for any outcome variable; however, SLR, CVA, and CROM significantly improved within-group after the one-session intervention in neck pain patients with hamstring tightness."

  "date": "2021 Jun 7",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Abnormal posture can affect the alignment of the cervical spine, which can lead to various physical problems. There are many ways to solve the problem by limiting the area around the neck to restore abnormal neck condition. However, there is a need to look at these problems from an enlarged perspective through the relationship between the cervical spine and trunk. This study aimed to investigate the significance of the thickness of the transverse abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique muscles in patients with forward head posture and reduced cranio-vertebral angle. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 24 healthy adult males in their 20s without lower back pain. The cranio-vertebral angle (CVA) in all the subjects was measured with the help of pictures taken in the sagittal plane using a digital camera. The thickness of muscles, including transverse abdominis (TrA), internal oblique (IO), and external oblique (EO), was measured using a diagnostic ultrasound device. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to identify the correlation between the variables measured. RESULTS CVA showed a statistically significant correlation with TrA thickness (r=0.506/p=0.012), and among the abdominal muscles, there was a significant correlation between IO and EO thickness (r=0.663/p=0.000). CONCLUSIONS A reduced CVA due to FHP was significantly associated with reduced TrA thickness. Therefore, increasing the bulk of the abdominal muscles with restoration of the abnormal CVA is a potential treatment approach and requires further study."

  "date": "2021 May 22",
  "abstract": "Background: Teaching is one of the professions where incidence and prevalence of neck pain is high. Prolonged use of computers, which has further increased due to online teaching amid pandemic, is known to cause neck pain and alter posture, while people with forward head posture (FHP) are prone to develop neck pain and related disability. Research has shown that impairment of deep cervical flexor (DCF) muscles leads to insufficiency in coordination, activation, overload, and poor support on cervical structures that further lead to development of neck pain and altered neck posture. The objective of this study was to see the effect of DCF muscle training using pressure biofeedback on pain and FHP in school teachers with neck pain.\nMethods: This observational study was conducted at medical center in school premises. Fifty-five school teachers aged between 25 and 40 years with experience of more than 5 years were invited to participate in this study. Subjects were divided in two groups. Both the groups received conventional exercises while in experimental group DCF muscle training using pressure biofeedback was given additionally. Pain and FHP were assessed using NPRS and cranio-vertebral angle using digital photograph technique, respectively, at baseline and end of four weeks of treatment.\nResults: Although pain and FHP improved in both the groups, mean improvement in both the measures was more in the group that also received DCF training using pressure biofeedback.\nConclusions: This study shows that although pain and FHP improved following conventional exercises in school teachers with neck pain, mean improvement was more significant among those who received additional DCF muscle training using pressure biofeedback."

Prolonged use of smartphones could lead to musculoskeletal problems.\nObjectives: To investigate the effect of SVT on head and neck posture during and after using smartphones for various periods of time in either standing or sitting postures.\nMethods: This observational study included 34 male children aged 5-12 years who were assigned to one of two groups based on average smartphone use duration per day: group A comprised 18 children averaging > 4 hours per day (h/day) of smartphone use, and group B comprised 16 children with < 4 h/day of smartphone use. The children's postures were photographed in standing and sitting positions while using a smartphone and 30 min after ceasing smartphone use. The head flexion, neck flexion, gaze, and craniocervical angles were measured using the software program Kinovea.\nResults: Significant increases were found in head flexion, neck flexion, and gaze angles. Furthermore, both groups saw a significant decrease in craniocervical angle when sitting compared to when standing, both during and 30 min after smartphone use. The head flexion, neck flexion, and gaze angles of group A were significantly higher than those of group B, and the craniocervical angle of group A was significantly lower than that of group B in both postures (p< 0.05).\nConclusion: SVT is associated with increased neck and head flexion posture in children, especially in a sitting position."

  "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether the use of a lumbar roll reduced forward head posture (FHP) while sitting among individuals with or without musculoskeletal disorders. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from their inception to August 2020. The quality of evidence for variables used in the meta-analysis was determined using the GRADE system. Five studies satisfied the criteria for data analysis. All studies included individuals without any spinal symptoms. Data from five studies on neck angle showed a statistically significant (p = 0.02) overall effect (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.77), indicating a lesser neck flexion angle while sitting with a lumbar roll than without it. Data from two studies on head angle showed a statistically significant (p = 0.04) overall effect (SMD = 0.47), indicating a lesser head extension angle while sitting with a lumbar roll than without it. In each meta-analysis, the quality of evidence was very low in the GRADE system. The use of a lumbar roll while sitting reduced FHP among individuals without spinal symptoms."

  "date": "2021 May 21",
  "abstract": "Upper cross syndrome (UCS) is a condition caused from prolonged poor posture manifesting as thoracic hyperkyphosis with forward head and shoulder postures. It has been associated with several other secondary conditions, causing pain and discomfort to those with the condition. This is a case report of a 35-year-old female presenting to clinic with a sharp pain in the neck, upper back, and sternum area for 4 weeks and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She had been working at home for several months after the shelter at home order was issued. Following evaluation and corrective treatment with cervical adjustment and soft tissue massage, the patient's posture improved and reported full pain resolution. Her symptoms of GERD concurrently resolved as well. She continued to receive chiropractic adjustment two times per month for correcting spinal misalignment. Full restoration of posture was attained on the full spine radiographs at 9 months follow-up. The patient remained symptom-free at 12 months follow-up. Manipulative and preventive therapies aimed at treating and preventing UCS should be more widely adopted to prevent secondary conditions."

  "title": "Quantitative measurements of forward head in college-aged students: A conformational study of intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of a novel Posture Measuring Device",
  "date": "2021 Apr",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Medical professionals frequently encounter forward head postures (FHP) in the treatment of cervical spine pain. In the clinical setting, FHP measurements are often described subjectively using the phrase, \"patient demonstrates forward head posture.\" There are reliable tools that can objectively measure FHP, but they are not frequently used in the clinical setting on a regular basis because the tools are unavailable, inconvenient or overly time-consuming. The objective of this study was to confirm if FHP can be reliably measured using a novel posture-measuring device. The Posture Measuring Device (PMD) was designed to quickly obtain objective measurements of FHP in the outpatient clinical setting. A pilot study demonstrated good to excellent reliability in intra-rater (test-retest) measurements and good interrater reliability using two first-year Doctor of Physical Therapy Students as raters. This study is to confirm that the PMD is able to provide intra-rater and interrater reliability using two physical therapists and two second-year Doctor of Physical Therapy students to obtain FHP measurements.\nMethods: Twenty-three college-aged subjects were measured individually using a PMD by a panel of four raters consisting of two physical therapists and two second-year physical therapy students to develop interrater reliability. Each rater measured each subject twice on two separate occasions to obtain a measure of intra-rater (relative) reliability.\nResults: Pearson Correlations demonstrate high intra-rater correlation with inconsistent interrater correlation. The average measured Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was .822 with a 95% confidence interval indicating a high degree of reliability between the eight measurements performed on each subject. Cronbach's alpha results confirm the ICC findings of strong correlation among the eight raters (α = 0.87).\nDiscussion and conclusion: Objective measurement of forward head posture is valuable to document and monitor patient response to treatment. This study identifies a convenient and time-efficient method for measuring forward head in the clinical setting. The PMD demonstrated a high degree of reliability in intra-rater measurements of FHP."

  "date": "2021 Aug",
  "abstract": "Aim: The frequency of neck pain increases in adolescents and young adults. Using smart phones and computers for a long time causes posture disorders such as rounded shoulder (RSP) and forward head postures, and these posture disorders cause neck pain. The aim of the study is to analyse the correlation between shoulder and neck angles and the stiffness of the upper trapezius and pectoralis minor muscles in patients with RSP.\nMethod: Patients with neck pain examined by shear wave elastography were screened retrospectively. Patients with RSP were determined. Of these patients, whose had evaluated for shoulder and neck angles with a smart phone-based photogrammetric method were assigned. Patients with a history of operation/trauma, connective tissue or neurological disease were excluded. A total of 39 female patients were included in the study. Age, height, weight, elastography measurements, cervical and shoulder angles were noted. Obtained data were statistically analysed with SPSS 22.0 program.\nResults: Cervical and shoulder angles of the patients were 52.2 ± 3.8 and 57.91 ± 9.4, respectively. The stiffness of the right and left upper trapezius muscles and right and left pectoralis minor muscles were 42.5 ± 14.1, 47.1 ± 17.1, 20.5 ± 8.0 and 17.9 ± 8.4, respectively. In multiple regression analysis, it was observed that the stiffness of the left upper trapezius muscle was positively correlated with the shoulder angle.\nConclusion: The upper trapezius muscle stiffness increased in RSP. It can reveal the relationship between RSP and neck pain."

  "abstract": "An acceptable reliability is needed for each scale and a valid decision-making process. Ultrasonography is a simple, cost-effective, and accessible tool compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess echo intensity (EI) as a biomarker of muscle function in neck musculoskeletal problems. However, no evidence is available regarding the reliability of neck muscle echogenicity according to rehabilitative ultrasonography in clinical studies on forward head posture (FHP). We determined the reliability of neck muscles EI in individuals with and without FHP. Transverse images of deep neck flexors (Longus Coli) and suboccipital (Rectus capitis posterior minor) muscles were acquired from 20 individuals with FHP and 20 controls in one session. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimum detectable change (MDC), and standard error of measurement (SEM) for EI were measured in this study. The ICC, SEM, and MDC ranges were 0.50 - 0.51, 2.73 - 3.41, and 7.56 - 9.46 for the Longus colli muscle and 0.48 - 0.49, 3.29 - 4.98, and 9.13 - 13.81 for the rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPm) muscle, respectively. Based on the present findings, EI showed acceptable reliability; therefore, it can be used for assessment of neck muscle morphology."

  "date": "2021 Jun",
  "abstract": "Over the last several decades, studies in humans and animal models have successfully identified numerous molecules required for hearing and balance. Many of these studies relied on unbiased forward genetic screens based on behavior or morphology to identify these molecules. Alongside forward genetic screens, reverse genetics has further driven the exploration of candidate molecules. This review provides an overview of the genetic studies that have established zebrafish as a genetic model for hearing and balance research. Further, we discuss how the unique advantages of zebrafish can be leveraged in future genetic studies. We explore strategies to design novel forward genetic screens based on morphological alterations using transgenic lines or behavioral changes following mechanical or acoustic damage. We also outline how recent advances in CRISPR-Cas9 can be applied to perform reverse genetic screens to validate large sequencing datasets. Overall, this review describes how future genetic studies in zebrafish can continue to advance our understanding of inherited and acquired hearing and balance disorders."

  "date": "2020 Dec 16",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to examine the electromyographic activity of the regional spinal muscle between patients with forward head posture (FHP) and those with a normal cranio-vertebral (CV) angle.\nMethods: We recruited 60 adult women aged between 18 and 29 years from a single institution. The CV angle was measured in the sagittal plane, which helped us to assign the participants in the FHP group (n = 30) with a large CV angle (53.1 ± 2.3) and the control group (n = 30) with a normal CV angle (43.0 ± 3.6). The surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure the magnitude of normalised muscle activity of eight spinal muscles (cervical, lumbar, and thoracic levels) while standing and performing a specific manual handling task.\nResults: The CV angle was significantly lower in the FHP group than in the control group (p = .001). The cervical erector spinae (CES) muscle activity was significantly increased in the FHP group compared to that in the control group. The right and left CES of those in the FHP group exhibited 73% and 87%, respectively, higher normalised muscle activity than those in the control group while performing the manual handling task (p = .001). No significant difference was detected for the thoracic or lumbar segment muscles between groups.\nConclusion: Our results indicate that greater neck muscle demands result from anterior head translation in FHP. This effect is a counterbalance to the reduced CV angle and to support the neck. The increased activity of the neck muscles in FHP could demand more support from the neck muscles and might increase the risk of spinal injuries. Management of FHP is essential to avoid overloading the spinal muscles."

The ImageJ software and a spinal mouse device were used to measure FHP and HKP deformities, and neck and shoulder muscle strength, range of motion (ROM), and pulmonary function were assessed as the secondary outcomes before and after the eight-week intervention.\nResults: FHP improved more significantly in the Sahrmann group compared to the NASM group (P< 0.05), while no significant difference was observed between the groups in HKP (P> 0.05). The improvement in the neck and shoulder muscle strength was more significant in the Sahrmann group compared to the NASM (P< 0.05), except for the neck flexors. In addition, the neck extension ROM enhanced more significantly in the Sahrmann group compared to the NASM group (P< 0.05).\nConclusion: According to the results, the Sahrmann corrective exercises that focused on the correction of imbalanced muscle stiffness had more significant effects on the correction of FHP, neck and shoulder muscle strength and neck extension ROM."

  "title": "Validation of forward simulations to predict the effects of bilateral plantarflexor weakness on gait",
  "date": "2021 Jun",
  "abstract": "Background: Bilateral plantarflexor muscle weakness is a common impairment in many neuromuscular diseases. However, the way in which severity of plantarflexor weakness affects gait in terms of walking energy cost and speed is not fully understood. Predictive simulations are an attractive alternative to human experiments as simulations allow systematic alterations in muscle weakness. However, simulations of pathological gait have not yet been validated against experimental data, limiting their applicability.\nResearch question: Our first aim was to validate a predictive simulation framework for walking with bilateral plantarflexor weakness by comparing predicted gait against experimental gait data of patients with bilateral plantarflexor weakness. Secondly, we aimed to evaluate how incremental levels of bilateral plantarflexor weakness affect gait.\nMethods: We used a planar musculoskeletal model with 9 degrees of freedom and 9 Hill-type muscle-tendon units per leg. A state-dependent reflex-based controller optimized for a function combining energy cost, muscle activation squared and head acceleration was used to simulate gait. For validation, strength of the plantarflexors was reduced by 80 % and simulated gait compared with experimental data of 16 subjects with bilateral plantarflexor weakness. Subsequently, strength of the plantarflexors was reduced stepwise to evaluate its effect on gait kinematics and kinetics, walking energy cost and speed.\nResults: Simulations with 80 % weakness matched well with experimental hip and ankle kinematics and kinetics (R > 0.64), but less for knee kinetics (R < 0.55). With incremental strength reduction, especially beyond a reduction of 60 %, the maximal ankle moment and power decreased. Walking energy cost and speed showed a strong quadratic relation (R2>0.82) with plantarflexor strength.\nSignificance: Our simulation framework predicted most gait changes due to bilateral plantarflexor weakness, and indicates that pathological gait features emerge especially when bilateral plantarflexor weakness exceeds 60 %. Our framework may support future research into the effect of pathologies or assistive devices on gait."

  "title": "Assessing head acceleration to identify a motor threshold to galvanic vestibular stimulation",
  "date": "2021 Jun 1",
  "abstract": "Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is used to assess vestibular system function, but vestibulospinal responses can exhibit variability depending on protocols or intensities used. Here, we measured head acceleration in healthy subjects to identify an objective motor threshold on which to base GVS intensity when assessing standing postural responses. Thirteen healthy right-handed subjects stood on a force platform, eyes closed, and head facing forward. An accelerometer was placed on the vertex to detect head acceleration, and electromyography activity of the right soleus was recorded. GVS (200 ms; current steps 0.5, from 1 mA to 4 mA) was applied in a binaural and bipolar configuration. 1) GVS induced a biphasic accelerometer response at a latency of 15 ms. Based on response amplitude, we constructed a recruitment curve for all participants and determined the motor threshold. In parallel, the method of limits was used to devise a more rapid approach to determine motor threshold. 2) We observed significant differences between motor threshold based on a recruitment curve and all perceptual thresholds reported either by the subject (sensation of movement) or a standing experimenter observing the participant (perception of movement). No significant difference was observed between the motor threshold based on the method of limits and perceptual thresholds of movement. 3) Using orthogonal polynomial contrasts, we observed a linear progression between multiples of the objective motor threshold (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5× motor threshold) and the 95% confidence ellipse area, the first peak of center of pressure displacement velocity, and the short and medium latency responses in the soleus. Hence, an objective motor threshold for GVS based on head acceleration was identified in standing participants and a recruitment curve could be constructed for all participants. These novel approaches could enable better understanding of changes in the vestibular system in different conditions or over time.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) has been used to assess the vestibular system, but the significant interindividual variability in the responses makes it difficult to quantitatively compare them between individuals or conditions. Using an accelerometer to quantify head movement induced by GVS, we were able to determine an objective motor threshold and construct a recruitment curve for all participants. These methods could help assess changes in the vestibular system under different conditions."

  "date": "2021 Mar 30",
  "abstract": "Background: Dysphagia after occipitocervical fixation (OCF) is a complex phenomenon and revision surgery in this context involves difficult decision-making. The pathogenesis is explored and surgical strategies discussed. A surgical strategy that has not been described before in the management of this condition, is discussed with two illustrative cases.\nMethods: Two cases are presented where dysphagia occurred after OCF for C1/C2 instability. The preoperative imaging was not available to determine whether the optimal craniocervical angle had been achieved. Both had revision surgery with removal of the cranial fixation and fusion to the atlas instead. One of the cases had the revision surgery more than 10 years after the original OCF.\nResults: The dysphagia recovered after the revision surgery in both cases. The patients gained weight and reported more satisfaction with their posture and head movements compared to before the revision surgery. There was no head ptosis and instead, patients reported better forward gaze and head position.\nConclusion: In cases of C1/C2 instability, it is preferable to perform C1/C2 fusion rather than OCF. If performing an OCF, care must be taken to fix the head at the same O-C2 angle as preoperative. When an OCF done for C1 C2 instability ends up causing dysphagia, it is feasible and effective to shorten the rostral construct by removing the cranial fixation and fusing to C1 instead."

  "date": "2021",
  "abstract": "Background: Forward head posture (FHP) is the most common malposition in the head and neck area. With the growing use of digital devices, the prevalence of FHP may be expected to increase dramatically. Thus far, FHP has been evaluated only in the sagittal plane.\nObjective: The objective of this study was to measure angles and indices from anatomical landmarks in the frontal plane and determine the possible correlations between these variables and craniovertebral angle (CVA) as an index of FHP in the sagittal plane.\nMethods: Fifty eight healthy individuals (29 men, 29 women) between 18 and 40 years old participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants were evaluated with an 8-camera motion analysis system. After markers were placed on predetermined landmarks, the participants were asked to maintain their head and neck in the neutral position for 5 seconds. Then participants induced FHP by flexing and lowering their head. The correlation between CVA and a set of angles and indices was calculated at the moment of FHP induction.\nResults: A moderate correlation was observed between 3-D CVA and the angle formed between the sternum and both tragi for the whole sample and separately in both sexes. A moderate negative correlation was observed between 3-D CVA and height, weight, and BMI in women. A moderate negative correlation was observed between 3-D CVA and height, weight, BMI, and hours on digital devices in men.\nConclusions: Changes in CVA in the sagittal plane can be predicted from changes in the angle formed between the midpoint of the sternum and the left and right tragi in the frontal plane."

  "abstract": "Background: In this study, the effect of adding a smartphone app to an 8-week global postural reeducation (GPR) on neck pain, endurance, quality of life, and forward head posture (FHP) in patients with chronic neck pain and FHP was evaluated.\nMethods: Sixty male and female office workers (38.5 ± 9.1 years) with chronic neck pain were randomly assigned into three groups: group 1 (GPR+ a smartphone app, n = 20), group 2 (GPR alone, n = 20), and group 3 (the control group, n = 20). The primary outcome was pain and the secondary outcomes were disability, quality of life, endurance, and posture. Pain, disability, endurance, quality of life, and posture were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), progressive iso-inertial lifting evaluation (PILE) test, quality of life questionnaire (SF-36), and photogrammetry, respectively, at pre-and post-8-week interventions. A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) has been conducted to statistically analyze the data.\nResults: The GPR+ a smartphone app had statistically significant improvements versus GPR alone in pain (mean difference, - 2.05 ± 0.65, ES (95% CI) - 0.50 (- 1.04 to - 0.01), P = 0.04), disability (difference = 11.5 ± 1.2, ES (95% CI) = 0.31 (0.22 to 0.97), p = 0.033), FHP (difference = 1.6 ± 0.2, ES (95% CI) = 0.31 (0.09 to 0.92), p = 0.047), and endurance (difference = 2 ± 3.3, ES (95% CI) = 0.51 (0.02 to 1.03), p = 0.039). Both of the GPR+ a smartphone app and GPR alone groups had statistically significant differences versus the control group in all outcomes.\nConclusion: When a workplace assessment and management could not be as part of any intervention, adding a smartphone app to GPR for NP may be an appropriate tool to administer a home and work exercise program resulting in elevating pain and disability, as well as improving FHP and endurance.\nTrial registration: Current Controlled Trials using the UMIN-RCT website UMIN000039720 .

  "date": "2021 May",
  "abstract": "Background: Recent studies have shown that a short lingual frenulum is a potential risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children. A short frenulum leads to abnormal orofacial development and may consequently contribute to sleep-disordered breathing by narrowing the upper airways and increasing the risk of upper-airway collapsibility. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a short lingual frenulum on the risk of OSAS in children.\nMethods: Children from pre-, primary, secondary, and high school, aged 3-17 years, were included in the study. Parents/guardians were asked to fill in the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), and then, children at risk of OSAS were enrolled in the study group. A control group was established randomly from patients with negative PSQ results. A physical examination, including measurements of head-forward posture (HFP) and length of the free tongue, inter-incisor distance and subjective high-arched palate evaluation was performed in children from both groups.\nResults: A total of 1,500 PSQ questionnaires were distributed, and less than half (713) were returned correctly filled in. In the second part of the study, 135 children were evaluated: 67 in the study group and 68 in the control group. The mean ages were 9.4 ± 3.0 and 9.5 ± 3.1 years, respectively. Children in the study group had significantly shorter lingual frenula, higher HFP measures, and had a higher prevalence of a high-arched palate. Based on statistical analysis, a short lingual frenulum (OR 5.02 [1.58-15.94]).\nConclusions: The study identified a relationship between a short lingual frenulum and the risk of OSAS in children. Detecting and addressing ankyloglossia in children is necessary before it leads to orofacial changes, malocclusion, and consequently, sleep apnea. Furthermore, OSAS was associated with higher HFP, but no relationship was found between the two parameters."

A total of 32 patients with tension headaches and forward head posture were randomly assigned to two groups: an experimental group (n = 16) and a control group (n = 16). The experimental group performed cervical deep muscle flexion exercises for 4 weeks, whereas the control group performed stretching exercises for the same period. The Henry Ford Hospital Headache Disability Inventory (HDI) was used for headache assessment, and the Korean version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-K) was used for sleep disorder assessment. The experimental group showed a significant reduction in both HDI and PSQI-K score after 4 weeks of intervention (p < 0.001), while no significant difference was found in the control group (p > 0.05). On comparing the experimental and control groups, we found a significant difference in changes in the HDI and PSQI-K between the groups (p < 0.05). The results indicate that flexion exercise of the deep cervical muscles in patients with tension headache and forward head posture will improve the quality of life and activities of daily life by mitigating headaches and sleep disorders."

  "abstract": "The forward head posture (FHP) of stroke patients has a negative impact on respiratory function. Cervical spine mobilization is a manual therapy technique that used to prevent and treat FHP and respiratory function. This pilot study investigated whether cervical spine mobilization can effectively improve outcomes following FHP and respiratory function of stroke patients. Twenty-four patients participated in our assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. All the participants received neurodevelopmental treatments (gait training and trunk rehabilitation). The experimental group additionally received 15-min sessions of cervical spine mobilization three times per week for 4 weeks. The control group received cervical spine sham mobilization during the same period. For the cervical angles, the cranial vertebral angle (CVA) and cranial rotation angle (CRA) were measured. A respiratory function test was performed to measure the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), and chest circumferences (upper and lower chest sizes). Except for MIP, there was no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group. The CVA and CRA were significantly increased in the experimental group only. Cervical spine mobilization improved cervical angles and inspiratory function of the stroke patients in this study. However, a comparative study with a larger number of patients is needed to confirm this finding from our pilot study, which had a small sample size."

To prevent these disorders, this study proposes a quantitative investigation method which administers a postural evaluation questionnaire and a postural biomechanical evaluation to 100 healthy subjects.\nMethods: The reliability of the method is studied by comparing both assessments with digitized biometrics. In addition, 50 subjects undergo the biomechanical evaluation form twice, by four different operators, to study the intraoperative repeatability.\nResults: The results show a satisfactory overlap between the results obtained with the postural evaluation questionnaire and the postural biomechanical evaluation compared to computerized biometrics. Furthermore, intraoperative repeatability in the use of the biomechanical evaluation form is demonstrated thanks to a minimal margin of error.\nConclusions: This experience suggests the importance of undertaking this path in both the curative and the preventive sphere on a large scale and on different types of people who easily, and even unknowingly, may face dysfunctional syndromes, not only structural and myofascial but also consequently of the entire body's homeostasis."

  "date": "2021 Apr 1",
  "abstract": "Individuals tend to approach positive stimuli and avoid negative stimuli. Furthermore, emotions influence whether individuals freeze or move more. These two kinds of motivated behavior refer to the approach/avoidance behavior and behavioral freezing/activation. Previous studies examined (e.g., using forced platforms) whether individuals' behavior depends on stimulus' valence; however, the results were mixed. Thus, we aimed to test whether emotions' effects on spontaneous whole-body behavior of standing individuals also occur in the seated position. We used a computer vision method to measure the head sway in video recordings that offers ease of use, replicability, and unobtrusiveness for the seated research participant. We analyzed behavior recorded in the laboratory during emotion manipulations across five studies totaling 932 participants. We observed that individuals leaned more forward and moved more when watching positive stimuli than when watching negative stimuli. However, individuals did not behave differently when watching positive or negative stimuli than in the neutral condition. Our results indicate that head movements extracted from seated individuals' video recordings can be useful in detecting robust differences in emotional behavior (positive vs. negative emotions)."

  "title": "Does restoration of sagittal cervical alignment improve cervicogenic headache pain and disability: A 2-year pilot randomized controlled trial",
  "date": "2021 Mar 15",
  "abstract": "Background: To investigate the feasibility and effect of a multimodal program for improving chronic cervicogenic headache (CGH) via the addition of sagittal cervical spine alignment correction.\nDesign: Pilot, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial.\nParticipants: 60 patients with CGH, straightening of the cervical lordosis, and forward head posture (FHP) were randomly assigned using permuted-block randomization either to a control (n = 30) or an experimental group (n = 30).\nInterventions: Subjects in both groups received a multimodal program where the denneroll cervical spine extension traction orthotic was added to the experimental group only. Feasibility was assessed through recruitment rate, compliance rate, adherence rate, safety, and global satisfaction in addition to clinical outcome measures: FHP distance, cervical lordosis, headache frequency, headache disability inventory (HDI), headache impact test-6 (HIT-6), and daily defined dose (DDD). Evaluations were performed at: baseline, 10 weeks, 1 year follow up, and 2-year follow up. The assessor was blind to group allocation for all measured outcomes.\nResults: The recruitment rate was 60%, 78 % out of them completed the entire study. The recruited participants complied with 98% of the required visits. No adverse events were recorded and greater overall satisfaction with the interventions was reported. Greater improvements were found for the experimental group's cervical lordosis (f = 259.9, P< < .001) and FHP (f = 142.5, P< < .001). At 10 weeks, both groups showed equal improvements in CGH outcomes: headache frequency (P = 0.07), HDI (P = 0.07), HIT-6 (P = .2), and DDD (P = .3). In contrast, at the 1-year and 2-year follow up, between group differences were found for all CGH outcomes, P < .00, indicating greater improvement in the experimental group.\nConclusion: The results indicated feasibility for recruitment rate, compliance rate, exercise session adherence, safety, and global satisfaction. At 1-year and 2-year follow-up, the addition of the denneroll orthotic device revealed positive influence on CGH management outcomes.\nTrial registration: The trial was retrospectively registered with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR201605001650300)."

  "title": "Understanding upper body playing-related musculoskeletal disorders among piano and non-piano players using a photogrammetry",
  "date": "2021 Mar 15",
  "abstract": "Conclusion: The obtained results conclude piano players are highly prone to the risk of developing PRMSD in the upper body.\nResults: The findings showed piano players have a higher NDI, lower CVA, and RSP when compared with the non-piano players at a statistically significant level of p-value <0.05.\nObjective: Playing-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMSD) are a common problem for the pianist. The poor upper body ergonomics influences the natural positioning of the neck and shoulders, which involves forward head posture (FHP) and rounded shoulder posture (RSP). This misaligned position could produce a sensation of pain over the upper body, which affects the piano player and computer users with similar ergonomic posture. Recently, photogrammetry methods are commonly applied in a clinical setting to assess posture. The goal of this research is to compare the upper body playing-related muscu-loskeletal disorders between the piano and the non-piano players by applying photogrammetry.\nMaterials and methods: This causal-comparative study includes 70 participants with 35 piano and 35 non-piano players. The participant's FHP was assessed using a digitized photo to record the Craniovertebral angle (CVA) with the support of Kinovea software. Besides, digital Vernier Calliper used to assess the scapular index on the RSP and Neck disability indices (NDI) used to measure neck pain and functional disability of the participants."

  "title": "Global sagittal alignment after surgery of right thoracic idiopathic scoliosis in adolescents and adults with and without thoracic hypokyphosis",
  "date": "2021 Mar 18",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize global sagittal alignment in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) with normal kyphosis (NTK, kyphosis > 10°) and with thoracic hypokyphosis (THK, kyphosis < 10°), before and after posterior spinal fusion, and compare them with asymptomatic controls. 27 AIS girls and young adults with right thoracic curves were included (seventeen with age ≤ 18 years, then age > 21). Biplanar radiographies were acquired at baseline, immediate post-operatively, 1-year and 2-year follow-up, and 3D reconstruction of the spine and pelvis was performed. NTK and THK showed different global sagittal alignment, as well as differences compared to controls. AIS with THK at baseline had higher SVA/SFD (2.0 ± 2.9 vs - 0.4 ± 1.9; P < 0.05) and OD-HA (0.2 ± 1.4° vs - 1.3 ± 1.6°; P < 0.05) than controls, indicating that THK had compensated balance with unusual forward leaning posture. Immediately post-operation, SVA/SFD remained high (1.3 ± 3.0) while OD-HA reversed (- 1.2 ± 1.7°), indicating that THK patients had found partially compensated balance. After 2-yeas, both SVA/SFD (- 1.3 ± 2.1) and OD-HA (- 1.4 ± 0.9°) were normalized. The changes in global sagittal alignment and mechanism of balance are different in AIS with or without THK. As the head plays a critical role on balance during immediate and delayed post-operation, OD-HA can be complementary parameter for assessing global balance during post-operative follow-up of AIS patients with THK."

  "date": "2020 Oct 12",
  "abstract": "Objective: Use volunteer data and parametric finite element (FE) human body models to investigate how restraint systems can be designed to adapt to a diverse population and pre-crash posture changes induced by active safety features.\nMethods: Four FE human models were generated by morphing the midsize male GHBMC simplified model into geometries representing a midsize male, midsize female, short obese female (BMI 40 kg/m2), and large obese male (BMI 40 kg/m2) based on statistical skeleton and body shape geometry models. Each human model was positioned in a generic vehicle driver environment using two occupant pre-crash postures based on volunteer test results including one resulting from 1-g abrupt braking events. Improved restraint designs were manually developed for each occupant model in a 56 km/h frontal crash condition by adding a knee airbag, adjusting the shoulder belt load limit, steering column force, and driver airbag properties (tethers, inflation, and vent size). The improved designs were then tested at both pre-crash postures. Injury risks for the head, neck, chest, and lower extremities were analyzed.\nResults: Human size and shape dominated the occupant injury measures, while the pre-crash-braking induced posture had minimal effects. Some of the safety concerns observed for large occupants include head strike-through the airbag and a conflict between head and chest injuries, which were mitigated by a stiffer restraint system with properly-tuned driver airbag. Chest injuries were a prominent safety concern for female occupants, mitigated by a softer seatbelt and smaller airbag size near the chest. Obese occupants exhibited a higher likelihood of lower extremity injuries indicating a need for a knee airbag. A diverse set of improved restraint designs were effective in lowering injury risks, indicating that restraint adaptability is necessary for accounting for occupant diversity.\nConclusions: This study investigated the effects of occupant size and shape variability, posture, and restraint design on injury risk for high-speed frontal crashes. More forward initial postures due to active safety features may decrease head, neck, and lower extremity injury risk, but may also increase chest injury risk. Safety concerns observed for large occupants include head strike-through and a conflict between head and chest injuries. Obese occupants had higher knee-thigh-hip injury risk. New restraints that adapt to occupant size and body shape may improve crash safety for all occupants. Further investigation is needed to confirm and extend the findings of this study."

  "abstract": "Aim: To compare effects of clinical Pilates and home exercises on postural disorders, strength and endurance of deep cervical flexors (DCF), cervical range of motion (CROM), pain intensity and functional disability in sagittal cervical disorientation. Patients & methods: Fourty six patients were included and divided into two groups. Clinical Pilates group performed stabilization based exercise and home exercise group performed conventional exercises. Results: Craniovertebral, head tilt, cervicothoracic angles and strength and endurance of DCF muscles had improvement in favor of clinical Pilates group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in terms of right-left acromial distance, pain intensity, functional disability and CROM parameters (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Clinical Pilates exercises have been found to provide clinically significant improvements in craniovertebral, head tilt, cervicothoracic angles and strength and endurance of DCF muscles. However, in the increase of CROM, decreasing pain severity and functional impairment parameters there was no superiority of both exercise training.

  "date": "2020 Dec 25",
  "abstract": "Background: The hypopharynx is a closed space that is difficult to observe. The modified Killian's (MK) method was introduced to obtain wider exposure. However, this method requires keeping the head forward during the examination. Postural maintenance might be problematic. To use the MK method safely for a thorough endoscopic examination, we introduced a new body immobilization device. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this body immobilization device.\nMethods: Twenty-five patients underwent transnasal laryngoscopy using the MK method with the immobilization device. This device consists of a board to place the chest and a shaft. We classified hypopharynx visualization using a 5-point scale, in various combinations of head torsion, Valsalva maneuver, and MK position. Furthermore, we classified the feasibility of the MK method for 54 patients. Age, BMI, and performance status were evaluated by MK position feasibility class.\nResults: The MK method with the body immobilization device was completed in all patients. It was significantly associated with higher hypopharyngeal visibility score. BMI and performance status were significantly associated with MK method feasibility. There were no significant differences in hypopharynx visualization scores with versus without this device for the patients that could maintain the MK position on their own.\nConclusion: For patients with poor nutrition or poor ability to perform activities of daily living, it was difficult to maintain the MK position. Thus, this immobilization device might be useful to complete the MK method and provide accurate detection of hypopharyngeal lesions in these patients."

  "title": "Kinematic and Injury Response of Reclined PMHS in Frontal Impacts",
  "date": "2020 Nov",
  "abstract": "Frontal impacts with reclined occupants are rare but severe, and they are anticipated to become more common with the introduction of vehicles with automated driving capabilities. Computational and physical human surrogates are needed to design and evaluate injury countermeasures for reclined occupants, but the validity of such surrogates in a reclined posture is unknown. Experiments with post-mortem human subjects (PMHS) in a recline posture are needed both to define biofidelity targets for other surrogates and to describe the biomechanical response of reclined occupants in restrained frontal impacts. The goal of this study was to evaluate the kinematic and injury response of reclined PMHS in 30 g, 50 km/h frontal sled tests. Five midsize adult male PMHS were tested. A simplified semi-rigid seat with an anti-submarining pan and a non-production threepoint seatbelt (pre-tensioned, force-limited, seat-integrated) were used. Global motions and local accelerations of the head, pelvis, and multiple vertebrae were measured. Seat and seatbelt forces were also measured. Injuries were assessed via post-test dissection. The initial reclined posture aligned body regions (pelvis, lumbar spine, and ribcage) in a way that reduced the likelihood of effective restraint by the seat and seatbelt: the occupant's pelvis was initially rotated posteriorly, priming the occupant for submarining, and the lumbar spine was loaded in combined compression and bending due to the inertia of the upper torso during forward excursion. Coupled with the high restraining forces of the seat and seatbelt, the unfavorable kinematics resulted in injuries of the sacrum/coccyx (four of five PMHS injured), iliac wing (two of five PMHS injured), lumbar spine (three of five PMHS injured), and ribcage (all five PMHS suffered sternal fractures, and three of five PMHS suffered seven or more rib fractures). The kinematic and injury outcomes strongly motivate the development of injury criteria for the lumbar spine and pelvis, the inclusion of intrinsic variability (e.g., abdomen depth and pelvis shape) in computational simulations of frontal impacts with reclined occupants, and the adaptation of comprehensive restraint paradigms to predicted variability of occupant posture."

The cervical vertebral angle (CVA), cervical range of motion (ROM) and strength, pain (visual analogue scale-VAS), and neck disability index (NDI) were measured throughout the treatment period and in the two- and four-week post-treatment periods.\nResults: The combined application of IASTM and neuromuscular exercises contributed to a significantly greater improvement in CVA (Group A: + 7,2 deg vs Group B: + 1,1 deg) and NDI (Group A:-25,2 vs Group B:-5,8) than massage and the application of the same exercises. Both interventions improved cervical ROM and strength in the short term. Pain was also significantly improved in both groups in both the short (Group A VAS: - 5,97 vs Group B VAS: - 3,1) and intermediate term (Group A VAS:-5,5 vs Group B:-1,5).\nConclusions: Combining IASTM and exercises for the cervical and thoracic area can induce positive postural adaptations and improve the functional status of neck pain patients.\nTrial registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN54231174 .

  "abstract": "The purpose of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to examine the degrees of the cervical disc degeneration and the parameters of cervical sagittal balance in plain radiographs, representing cervical lordosis or head posture in subjects with posterior neck pain. A total of 113 patients with posterior neck pain with or without radiating pain were analyzed. The kinematic sagittal parameters of cervical radiographs were obtained at the occipito-cervical (O-C2) angle, sagittal Cobb's angles of C1-C2, C2-C7, and sagittal vertical axis (SVA) of C1-C7 and C2-C7. Cervical disc degeneration was evaluated using the sum of Pfirrmann grades and total modified Matsumoto scores calculated from MRI of the cervical spine. A significant positive correlation was found for the C2-C7 angle using the sum of the Pfirrmann grades and total modified Matsumoto scores, whereas the O-C2 angle and the C1-C2 angle were negatively correlated. The sagittal cervical parameters representing cervical kyphosis and jaw lifting posture were found to be significantly correlated with the degree of cervical disc degeneration. These findings suggest that the loss of the natural sagittal lordosis of the cervical spine may contribute to the progression of disc degeneration, rather than the forward head posture."

Craniovertebral angle was measured, and those with CVA ≤53° were assigned to the FHP group, whereas those with CVA >53° were assigned to the control group. Thereafter, cervicocephalic kinesthesia and EMG activity of the neck muscles were assessed. Cervicocephalic kinesthesia was measured using a head repositioning accuracy test for all cervical spine motions. EMG activity of the UT and SCM muscles was recorded at rest and during activity.\nResults: Position-sense error values were found to be significantly greater for all directions-ie, flexion, extension, side flexion, and rotation-in participants with FHP than those without (P < .05). EMG activity of the UT and SCM muscles was found to be significantly raised both at rest and during activity in individuals with FHP relative to the non-FHP group (P < .05). Position-sense error values showed a significant inverse correlation with CVA (P < .05).\nConclusion: Findings of the present study suggest that cervicocephalic kinesthesia and activation patterns of the neck muscles may be significantly altered in individuals with FHP. Also, cervicocephalic kinesthesia is significantly associated with the severity of FHP."

The muscle activity was investigated via surface electromyography during the use of three trial pillows: orthopedic pillow, hollow pillow, and Thai neck support pillow.\nResults: With the application of all three trial pillow, the FHP group demonstrated significantly greater middle-lower trapezius muscle activity than the normal head posture group (p< 0.05). Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius (UT) muscle activity were similar between the two groups (p> 0.05). Only UT muscle activity was affected by variations in pillow design. In the normal group, no difference was observed in the muscle activity between all three pillows (p> 0.05).\nConclusions: Feasibly, the ability to appropriately modify a pillow configuration without creating undesired muscle activation was limited to those exhibiting FHP. Therefore, specially designed pillows or mattresses should be investigated in terms of their relevance to muscle fatigue and potential musculoskeletal pain in FHP patients."

  "abstract": "Background: During walking, postural stability is controlled by visual, vestibular and proprioceptive input. The auditory system uses acoustic input to localize sound sources. For some static balance conditions, the auditory influence on posture was already proven. Little is known about the impact of auditory inputs on balance in dynamic conditions.\nObjective: This study is aimed at investigating postural stability of walking tasks in silence and sound on condition to better understand the impact of auditory input on balance in movement.\nMethods: Thirty participants performed: walking (eyes open), tandem steps, walking with turning head and walking over barriers. During each task, acoustic condition changed between silence and presented noise through an earth-fixed loudspeaker located at the end of the walking distance. Body sway velocity was recorded close to the body's center of gravity.\nResults: A decreased body sway velocity was significant for walking (eyes open), tandem steps and walking over barriers when noise was presented. Those auditory stimuli did not affect sway velocity while walking with turning head. The posture has probably improved due to the localization ability when walking with the head facing forward, while the localization ability was impaired when turning the head.\nConclusions: The localization ability of a fixed sound source through the auditory system has a significant but limited impact on posture while walking."

  "abstract": "The relationship between the forward head posture and mechanosensitivity in subjects with a cervicogenic headache (CGH) remains uncertain. The aim of the study was to evaluate if there was a relationship between the tissue mechanosensitivity and cranio-cervical angle (CCA) that was moderated by pain intensity and/or disability in subjects with CGH. A convenience sample of 102 subjects was recruited. The CCA was measured with photographs, using a postural assessment software. The pain intensity was measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS), and the disability was measured with the Northwick Park Questionnaire. The pressure pain threshold (PPT) was measured at the spinous process of C2, the upper trapezius and splenius capitis muscles, and the median nerve. Simple moderation multiple regression analyses were constructed. There was a positive relationship between PPT at C2 and CCA, but a nonsignificant relationship for the PPT measured at the muscles and median nerve. The effect of PPT at C2 over CCA was moderated by pain intensity (R2 = 0.17; R2 change = 0.06; p < 0.05) but not disability. The Johnson-Neyman analysis revealed a cut-off point for the statistical significance of 4.66 cm in VAS. There seems to be a positive relationship between PPT at C2 and CCA, which is positively moderated by pain intensity in subjects with CGH."

In phase I (n = 42), the assessor's accuracy in locating the C7SP using the flexion-extension and the modified thorax-rib static methods was compared to radiography. In phase II (n = 68), the craniocervical posture was analyzed with photogrammetry after palpation using the 2 methods. Neck pain intensity and disability were also determined.\nResults: The accuracy in locating the C7SP was higher using the modified thorax-rib static method (67%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 55-79) compared to the flexion-extension method (38%, 95% CI, 26-50, P = .016). Lower values of the craniocervical angle were obtained with the flexion-extension method than the modified thorax-rib static method (mean difference = -1.1°, 95% CI, -1.6 to -0.6, P < .001). However, both palpation methods resulted in similar classifications of participants as with or without forward head posture (P = .096). Weak correlations were observed between the craniocervical angle and neck pain intensity (ρ = -0.088 and -0.099, respectively) and disability (ρ = -0.231 and -0.249, respectively).\nConclusion: Craniocervical angles obtained using palpation methods with different accuracies were different, although the magnitude of the difference was insufficient to lead to different classifications of a forward head posture in adults with mild neck pain and disability. Craniocervical posture was weakly correlated with neck-pain intensity and disability."

  "date": "2021 Mar 3",
  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether sagittal neck sitting posture subgroup membership in late adolescence was a risk factor for persistent neck pain (PNP) in young adults.\nMethods: There were 686 participants enrolled in the Raine Study at the 17- and 22-year follow-ups. At 17 years of age, posture was measured by photographs, and 4 subgroups of sitting neck posture were determined by cluster analysis. Height and weight were measured, and exercise frequency, depression, and PNP were assessed by questionnaire. At 22 years of age, participants answered questions about neck pain and occupation type. Logistic regression examined if neck posture subgroups at 17 years of age were a risk factor for PNP at 22 years of age, taking into account other factors.\nResults: Female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.16-2.65) and PNP at 17 years of age (OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 2.57-5.57) were associated with PNP at 22 years of age. In females, neck posture subgroup at 17 years of age was a risk factor for PNP at 22 years of age. Compared with the upright subgroup, both the slumped thorax/forward head subgroup groups and the intermediate subgroup had decreased odds for PNP at 22 years of age (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.08-0.76; OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.15-0.99, respectively). No association was found in males.\nConclusion: After taking into account PNP at 17 years, sitting neck posture at 17 was not a risk factor for PNP at 22 years of age in males, whereas in females, more relaxed postures (slumped thorax/forward head and Intermediate postures) were protective of neck pain compared with upright posture.\nImpact: Females in late adolescence who sat in slumped thorax/forward head or intermediate posture rather than upright sitting posture had a lower risk of PNP as a young adult. The practice of generic public health messages to sit up straight to prevent neck pain needs rethinking."

  "date": "2021 Feb 12",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to validate a simple dynamic model of single-leg drop-landing to develop a methodological foundation for investigating mechanistic causes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and to explore mechanical associations between knee valgus torque and landing kinematics that are considered clinically as a high-risk landing posture for the injury. A triple-inverted-pendulum model in three-dimensional space, composed of rigid-links of head-arms-trunk (HAT), thigh and shank, was employed. We derived causal relationships that can predict post-impact kinetics, including impact ground reaction forces (GRFs) and corresponding knee joint torques from a given body-kinematics immediately before impact, based on an assumption of a completely inelastic collision between a landing foot (the distal end-point of the shank in the model) and the ground. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) analysis revealed that our model can achieve an acceptable agreement between experimentally measured and model-predicted impact GRFs and corresponding knee joint torques. The 95% one-tailed lower confidence limit of CCC of vertical, mediolateral GRFs and the varus/valgus torque were 0.665>ρc,a=0.643,0.786>ρc,a=0.758 and 0.531>ρc,a=0.508, respectively, for the least acceptable values ρc,a. Using this model, effects of three types of hypothetical pre-impact kinematics with modulated (i) medial/lateral leaning HAT angle, (ii) forward/backward HAT tilt-angle, and (iii) knee flexion/extension angle on the impact GRF and corresponding knee joint torque were evaluated. We showed that the smaller knee flexion and the greater HAT leaning toward the landing-limb-side, the larger the knee valgus torque is generated, as a mechanical consequence between the specific pre-impact kinematics and the knee loading associated with the risk of ACL injury. Further exploration of hypothetical kinematics using the model in the future work might contribute to identifying the risky landing kinematics beyond experimental limitations."

British Army foot-drill is an occupational military activity involving cyclical high impact loading forces greater than those observed in athletes during high level plyometrics. Foot-drill may contribute to the high rates of lower-extremity overuse injuries observed in recruits during basic training. There is limited research investigating foot-drill specific injury risk factors in women, despite greater incidences of musculoskeletal injury reported in women (522 vs. 417 per 1,000 personnel, OR: 1.53) when compared to men during basic training. This study aimed to quantify changes in ankle joint proprioception and dynamic postural stability following a period of British Army foot-drill. Fourteen women of similar age to British Army female recruits underwent pre-post foot-drill measures of frontal plane ankle joint position sense (JPS) and dynamic postural stability using the dynamic postural stability index (DPSI). Passive ankle JPS was assessed from relative test angles of inversion 30% (IN30%) and eversion 30% (EV30%) and IN60% of participants range of motion using an isokinetic dynamometer. The DPSI and the individual stability indices (medio-lateral [MLSI], anterior-posterior [APSI], and vertical [VSI]) were calculated from lateral and forward jump-landing conditions using force plates. Foot-drill was conducted by a serving British Army drill instructor. Significantly greater absolute mean JPS error for IN30% and EV30% was observed post foot-drill (p ≤ 0.016, d ≥ 0.70). For both the lateral and forward jump-landing conditions, significantly greater stability index scores were observed for MLSI, APSI, and DPSI (p ≤ 0.017, d ≥ 0.52). Significantly greater JPS error and stability index scores are associated with the demands of British Army foot-drill. These results provide evidence that foot-drill negatively affects lower-extremity proprioceptive acuity in recruit age-matched women, which has implications for increased injury risk during subsequent military physical activity, occurring in a normal training cycle."

  "title": "Triggering Postural Movements With Virtual Reality Technology in Healthy Young and Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Validation Study for Early Dementia Screening",
  "date": "2020 Nov 16",
  "abstract": "With the ultimate aim of early diagnosis of dementia, a new body balance assessment system with integrated head-mounted display-based virtual reality (VR) has been developed. We hypothesized that people would sway more in anterior-posterior (AP) direction when they were exposed to a VR environment where we intentionally provoked movements in forward and backward directions. A total of 14 healthy older adults (OA) (73.14±4.26 years) and 15 healthy young adults (YA) (24.93±1.49 years) were assessed for group differences in sway behavior. Body sway speed in 22 different conditions with and without VR environments was analyzed. Significant differences and large effect sizes were observed in AP sway under the VR environments (OA with P < 0.02; effect size> 0.61, YA with P < 0.003; effect size> 0.72) compared to the baseline condition without the VR environments. In addition, significant differences were found between the two groups in AP sway in all test conditions (P < 0.01). Our study shows that a VR environment can trigger body sway in an expected direction, which may indicate that it is possible to enhance the sensitivity of balance assessment by integrating immersive VR environments. The result of this study warrants a cross-sectional study in which OA diagnosed with and without dementia are compared on their sway behavior."

  "title": "Second-row occupant responses with and without intrusion in rear sled and crash tests",
  "date": "2021",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Intrusion of the occupant compartment increases the risks for severe injury and death. This study analyzes rear sled and crash tests with an instrumented second-row Hybrid III 5th percentile anthropometric test device (ATD) to assess occupant kinematics and biomechanical responses with and without intrusion of the second-row seatback.\nMethods: Three sled tests and four crash tests were conducted with a 1993 Ford Taurus and a belted 5th female ATD seated behind a belted 50th male ATD on the right-side of the vehicle. The sled tests were conducted at 25, 33 and 40 km/h and involved no intrusion. The first crash test was conducted with a passenger car striking the vehicle at 80 km/h with full centerline overlap. The second to fourth crash tests were with a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) striking with a 50% overlap. Tests 2 and 3 were at 51 km/h and test 4, at 80 km/h impact speed. A large wooden speaker box was placed in the trunk of the Taurus in tests 3 and 4. Second-row intrusion was measured at the right-rear outboard package shelf retractor.\nResults: The sled tests without intrusion had occupant responses below injury assessment reference values (IARVs). The right second-row ATD moved rearward relative to the interior, compressing the rear seatback until it rebounded forward. Occupant compartment intrusion of 12-77 cm in the crash tests pushed the ATD forward, increasing head and chest acceleration. The head, neck and chest biomechanical responses were below IARVs in crash tests 1 to 3 with minimal intrusion (≤ 25 cm). Most of the biomechanical responses were above IARVs for the right second-row ATD in test 4 with higher intrusion. The HIC increased with intrusion. Head acceleration was more than 2.5-times greater in test 3 than in test 2, highlighting the importance of cargo in rear crashes. Test 4 had 2.4-times more energy than test 3 and up to 7.7 times greater biomechanical responses with 77 cm of intrusion.\nConclusions: The crash tests show that intrusion increases occupant responses in the right second-row seat and pushes the occupant forward in rear impacts. The sled tests without intrusion had relatively low biomechanical responses. Intrusion was influenced by the crash energy and cargo."

  "title": "Does forward head posture change subacromial space in active or passive arm elevation?",
  "date": "2021 Aug",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Forward head posture (FHP) is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders that appears to affect the shoulder joint through the shared muscles between the head and neck area and the shoulder girdle. The present study compared the acromiohumeral distance between individuals with normal head and neck alignment and those with moderate and severe FHP in active and passive arm elevation.Methods: Based on the craniovertebral angle, 60 volunteers were selected and equally distributed among three groups, including group one with normal head and neck alignment, group two with moderate FHP and group three with severe FHP. The space between the humeral head and the acromion was measured in 10°, 45° and 60° of active and passive arm elevation as the acromiohumeral distance.Results: The acromiohumeral distance was only different between the three groups at 45° arm elevation angle, and this difference was significant between groups one and three. In active and passive arm elevation, increased arm elevation angle reduced the subacromial space significantly. Also, in each arm elevation angle, the subacromial space differed significantly between the active and passive arm elevations.Conclusions: The acromiohumeral distance was significantly lower in the severe FHP group than the group with normal head and neck alignment in the 45° active arm elevation angle, which could be due to the changed tension in tissues between active and passive arm elevation and also the maximum muscle activity in the 45° active arm elevation angle."

  "title": "Efficacy of Integrating Cervical Posture Correction With Lumbar Stabilization Exercises for Mechanical Low Back Pain: A Randomized Blinded Clinical Trial",
  "date": "2021 Feb 1",
  "abstract": "Although current lumbar stabilization exercises are beneficial for chronic mechanical low back pain, further research is recommended focusing on global spinal alignment normalization. This randomized, controlled, blinded trial was conducted to determine the effects of adding cervical posture correction to lumber stabilization on chronic mechanical low back pain. Fifty adult patients (24 males) with chronic mechanical low back pain and forward head posture received 12 weeks treatment of either both programs (group A) or lumbar stabilization (group B). The primary outcome was back pain. The secondary outcomes included the craniovertebral angle, Oswestry Disability Index, C7-S1 sagittal vertical axis, and sagittal intervertebral movements. The multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant group-by-time interaction (P = .001, partial η2 = .609). Pain, disability, C7-S1 sagittal vertical axis, and l2-l3 intervertebral rotation were reduced in group A more than B (P = .008, .001, .025, and .001). Craniovertebral angle was increased in A when compared to B (P = .001). However, there were no significant group-by-time interactions for other intervertebral movements. Within-group comparisons were significant for all outcomes except for craniovertebral angle within patients in the control group. Adding cervical posture correction with lumber stabilization for management of chronic low back pain seemed to have better effects than the application of a stabilization program only."

  "date": "2020 May 13",
  "abstract": "Plastic surgeons report the highest prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal pain and fatigue among surgical subspecialties. Musculoskeletal pain impacts daily life, career longevity, and economic burden secondary to occupational injury. Poor postural awareness and ergonomic set up in the operating room represent the most common etiology.\nMethods: A literature review was performed to highlight the ergonomic set-up, postural pitfalls, occupational injuries, and musculoskeletal pain in the operating room. An institutional survey was administered among resident and attending surgeons regarding musculoskeletal pain, posture, ergonomic education, and future improvements. Literature results, survey data, and intraoperative photographs were analyzed in collaboration with physical therapists and personal trainers.\nResults: Survey results demonstrated that 97% of resident and attending respondents experienced musculoskeletal pain and 83% reported a lack of education in posture and ergonomics. The main postural pitfalls included head forward and flexed positioning, abduction and internal arm rotation, and kyphosis of the thoracic spine. The collaborators developed instructional videos to assess posture and biomechanics and demonstrate targeted stretching and strength exercises to address specific neck, back, and shoulder pain.\nConclusions: Poor posture is unavoidable in the operating room at times. These educational videos should be utilized for self-motivated and prophylactic conditioning outside of the operating room to maintain physical well-being throughout a career in plastic surgery. Future focus should be aimed at implementing dedicated ergonomic education and physical wellness programs early in surgical resident training."

  "title": "Effective Assessments of a Short-Duration Poor Posture on Upper Limb Muscle Fatigue Before Physical Exercise",
  "date": "2020 Oct 6",
  "abstract": "A forward head and rounded shoulder posture is a poor posture that is widely seen in everyday life. It is known that sitting in such a poor posture with long hours will bring health issues such as muscle pain. However, it is not known whether sitting in this poor posture for a short period of time will affect human activities. This paper investigates the effects of a short-duration poor posture before some typical physical activities such as push-ups. The experiments are set up as follows. Fourteen male subjects are asked to do push-ups until fatigue with two surface electromyography (sEMG) at the upper limb. Two days later, they are asked to sit in this poor posture for 15 min with eight sEMG sensors located at given back muscles. Then they do the push-ups after the short-duration poor posture. The observations from the median frequency of sEMG signals at the upper limb indicate that the short-duration poor posture does affect the fatigue procedure of push-ups. A significant decreasing trend of the performance of push-ups is obtained after sitting in this poor posture. Such effects indicate that some parts of the back muscles indeed get fatigued with only 15 min sitting in this poor posture. By further investigating the time-frequency components of sEMG of back muscles, it is observed that the low and middle frequencies of sEMG signals from the infraspinatus muscle of the dominant side are demonstrated to be more prone to fatigue with the poor posture. Although this study focuses only on push-ups, similar experiments can be arranged for other physical exercises as well. This study provides new insights into the effect of a short-duration poor posture before physical activities. These insights can be used to guide athletes to pay attention to postures before physical activities to improve performance and reduce the risk of injury."

  "title": "Chronic Primary Headache Subjects Have Greater Forward Head Posture than Asymptomatic and Episodic Primary Headache Sufferers: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",
  "date": "2020 Oct 1",
  "abstract": "Objective: To summarize the cervical physical examination characteristics in subjects with chronic primary headache and compare those with a healthy population and a population with episodic primary headache.\nDesign: Systematic review and meta-analysis.\nSubjects: Humans ≥18 years old. At least one of the study groups should be constituted by subjects diagnosed with one of the chronic primary headache subtypes according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition.\nComparison: Neck physical examination outcomes of subjects with chronic primary headache compared with a healthy population or subjects with episodic primary headache.\nOutcomes: Forward head posture (FHP), cervical range of movement, motor control, neck muscle activity, and reproduction and resolution of symptoms.\nMethods: Two reviewers assessed independently the MEDLINE, EMBASE, WOS, MEDES, PEDro, and CINAHL databases to select observational studies. First, both implemented an agreement for a search strategy. Then, they screened independently for duplicates, titles, abstracts, and full-text information. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare measures between groups.\nResults: Twelve studies (N = 1,083) with moderate quality (mean ± SD = 7.75 ± 1.48 on the Newcastle Ottawa Scale) were selected for the qualitative analysis. The meta-analysis showed that patients with chronic primary headache presented greater forward head posture than asymptomatic participants (N = 275, Hg = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.25-1.1, Z = 3.14, P < 0.01) and patients with episodic primary headache (N = 268, Hg = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.13-0.65, Z = 2.98, P < 0.01).\nConclusions: There is moderate to strong evidence that patients with chronic primary headache present greater FHP than asymptomatic individuals and moderate evidence that patients with chronic primary headache present greater forward head posture than those with episodic primary headache."

  "date": "2020",
  "abstract": "Background: Smartphones (SPs) are widely used by people of all age groups and genders. Users spend many hours per day on the SPs for different purposes, which imposes significant stress on their musculoskeletal system.\nObjectives: This study explored head forward flexion, lateral bending angle, and viewing distance while working with a SP in sitting/standing postures and one-handed/two-handed grips. The users' performance as well as pain development were also investigated.\nMethods: Participants answered a questionnaire on pain experience before and after SP usage. Neck kinematics of 20 SP users were monitored by a motion analysis system while doing three tasks (typing, video watching, and reading) in sitting and standing postures. Performance was evaluated by number of typed words, amount of errors in typing, and total read words.\nResults: The results indicated a significant increase in pain complaints in neck and upper limbs after test completion. Working with SPs in sitting and standing postures were, respectively, associated with greater head forward flexion for watching and viewing distance for two-handed typing tasks. Higher left lateral bending values were measured for one-handed watching and reading tasks in standing posture. The performance measures were superior for two-handed grips in all conditions.\nConclusions: Overall, using SPs in sitting posture creates greater head forward flexion and lower lateral bending angles in all tasks and grip types. The findings of this study can be used to provide recommendations for SP users."

  "title": "Pediatric occupant human body model kinematic and kinetic response variation to changes in seating posture in simulated frontal impacts - with and without automatic emergency braking",
  "date": "2020 Oct 12",
  "abstract": "Objective: The study quantifies the kinematics of children in booster child restraint systems (CRSs) in various naturalistic seating postures exposed to frontal impacts in a full-vehicle environment, with and without the application of pre-crash automatic emergency braking.\nMethods: The PIPER 6YO and 10YO pediatric human body models were positioned in CRSs. The 6YO was restrained on a lowback (LBB) and highback (HBB) booster, while the 10YO was positioned on an LBB and in a NoCRS condition. All simulations used the 3-point seatbelt. The child models were pre-positioned (gravity settled, seatbelt tensioned) in four naturalistic seating postures: leaning-forward, leaning-forward-inward, leaning-forward-outward, and a pre-submarining position, along with a baseline reference seating position. A 2012 Toyota Camry finite element (FE) model was used as the vehicle environment. A standard 3-point lap-shoulder belt system was modeled to restrain the child and CRS in the left-rear vehicle seat. Two vehicle impact cases were considered: with and without a pre-crash AEB. For with-AEB cases, a pre-crash phase was run to incorporate postural changes due to the application of AEB. All seating positions were ultimately subjected to a full-frontal rigid-barrier impact at 35 MPH. A total of 40 conditions were simulated in LS-DYNA.\nResults: Injury metrics varied widely for both occupants. Shoulder belt slippage was observed for the 6YO leaning-forward-inward on HBB. No head contact was observed for any simulated cases. Forward-leaning and forward-inward-leaning postures generally had greater head excursion across all seating postures. The lap belt rode over the pelvis for pre-submarining postures. Injury metrics for cases with pre-crash AEB were lower compared to their corresponding without-AEB cases. HIC15, head acceleration, upper neck tension force, and upper neck flexion moment were similar or lower for with-AEB scenarios.\nConclusions: Pre-crash AEB reduces the effect of the impact despite the same collision speed as cases without-AEB. This is primarily due to the limited travel distance of the occupant, thus, starting an earlier ride-down during the crash. Moreover, different initial seating postures lead to a wide range of injury exposures. Vehicle and child restraint design should incorporate these seating postures to ensure robust protection of the occupant in a crash."

  "abstract": "Introduction: Forward head posture is the most frequently observed postural deviations and is said to be associated with shortening of posterior cervical extensors and weakening of the anterior deep cervical flexors. Manual therapy has the potential to achieve reflexogenic changes in muscle and enhance the motor activity and strength.\nPurpose of the study: To evaluate the immediate effect of grade IV cervicothoracic Maitland mobilization on deep neck flexors strength in individuals with forward head posture.\nStudy design: A Single-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial.\nMethod: Sixty individuals were randomly divided into two groups. Placebo-controlled (PBO) group (n = 30) received the grade I and experimental (EXP) group (n = 30) received grade IV posteroanterior central and unilateral Maitland mobilization from the upper cervical to the upper thoracic spine. Outcome measure: Clinical Cranio-cervical flexion test (CCFT) was used to measure the motor activity and the strength of deep neck flexors.\nResults: The strength of deep neck flexors effectively increased (p = <0.0001) after advocating grade IV mobilization.\nConclusion: This study concluded that grade IV central and unilateral posteroanterior Maitland mobilization demonstrated significant increase in the deep neck flexors strength in individuals with forward head posture."

  "abstract": "In contemporary societies, computer use by children is a necessity and thus highly prevalent. Using computers for long hours is related to a higher risk of computer-related muscular disorders like forward head posture (FHP) and neck pain (NP). Deep cervical flexor (DCF) muscles are important head-on-neck posture stabilizers; thus, their training may lead to an improvement in FHP and NP. The aim of this study was to determine if 4 weeks of DCF training is effective in alleviating NP, improving FHP, and functional status in adolescent children using computers regularly, a pretest-posttest experimental group design was used. Subjects were randomly assigned into the experimental group (receiving DCF training and postural education) and the control group (receiving postural education only). 30 subjects with a mean age of 15.7 ± 1.725 years with NP and FHP using computers regularly participated in the study. Dependent variables were measured on day 1 (at baseline) and after 4 weeks of training. Photographic analysis was used for measuring FHP, visual analog scale for NP intensity, and neck disability index for functional status. Data analysis showed that in both groups, no significant improvement occurred in FHP. In both groups, there was a significant improvement in functional status and NP. There was no significant difference between both groups for FHP and NP. There was a significant improvement in functional status in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. Four weeks of DCF training does not cause a significant improvement in FHP in 13 to 18 years old adolescent children using computers regularly."

  "abstract": "Background and objectives: Tooth loss and consequent denture use and impaired posture and postural balance are more prevalent in older adults than in the young ones. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify the association between denture use, head posture, postural balance, and neck muscle strength (NMS). Materials and methods: We included 107 participants (56 in the non-denture use group and 51 in the denture use group) and measured their NMS, forward head posture, and postural balance. Forward head posture was measured using the craniocervical angle (CRA). Postural balance was assessed using a timed up-and-go test (TUG) and postural sway. An independent t-test was used to analyze the differences between the groups; Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation of period of denture use, head posture, and postural balance. Results: We found that the denture use group had lower NMS, smaller CRA, longer TUG, and longer postural sway length than the non-denture use group. Duration of denture use was significantly correlated with TUG. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that denture use does not help with NMS, forward head maintain NMS, head posture, and postural balance in older adults."

  "title": "Doing nothing and what it looks like: inactivity in fattening cattle",
  "date": "2020 Jul 21",
  "abstract": "Background: Animals kept in barren environments often show increased levels of inactivity and first studies indicate that inactive behaviour may reflect boredom or depression-like states. However, to date, knowledge of what inactivity looks like in different species is scarce and methods to precisely describe and analyse inactive behaviour are thus warranted.\nMethods: We developed an Inactivity Ethogram including detailed information on the postures of different body parts (Standing/Lying, Head, Ears, Eyes, Tail) for fattening cattle, a farm animal category often kept in barren environments. The Inactivity Ethogram was applied to Austrian Fleckvieh heifers kept in intensive, semi-intensive and pasture-based husbandry systems to record inactive behaviour in a range of different contexts. Three farms per husbandry system were visited twice; once in the morning and once in the afternoon to cover most of the daylight hours. During each visit, 16 focal animals were continuously observed for 15 minutes each (96 heifers per husbandry system, 288 in total). Moreover, the focal animals' groups were video recorded to later determine inactivity on the group level. Since our study was explorative in nature, we refrained from statistical hypothesis testing, but analysed both the individual- and group-level data descriptively. Moreover, simultaneous occurrences of postures of different body parts (Standing/Lying, Head, Ears and Eyes) were analysed using the machine learning algorithm cspade to provide insight into co-occurring postures of inactivity.\nResults: Inspection of graphs indicated that with increasing intensity of the husbandry system, more animals were inactive (group-level data) and the time the focal animals were inactive increased (individual-level data). Frequently co-occurring postures were generally similar between husbandry systems, but with subtle differences. The most frequently observed combination on farms with intensive and semi-intensive systems was lying with head up, ears backwards and eyes open whereas on pasture it was standing with head up, ears forwards and eyes open.\nConclusion: Our study is the first to explore inactive behaviour in cattle by applying a detailed description of postures from an Inactivity Ethogram and by using the machine learning algorithm cspade to identify frequently co-occurring posture combinations. Both the ethogram created in this study and the cspade algorithm may be valuable tools in future studies aiming to better understand different forms of inactivity and how they are associated with different affective states."

  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the mobile application forward head posture in terms of validity, inter- and intra-rater reliability, minimum detectable change, sensitivity, and specificity to measure craniovertebral angle. In total, 44 subjects (mean age 23.30 ± 4.44 years) were evaluated in the standing position with markers on the tragus and cutaneous prominence of seventh cervical vertebra (C7). We had two experienced and trained physiotherapists assess cervical posture using the mobile application forward head posture and photogrammetry. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to determine validity and reliability. A contingency table was made to determine sensitivity and specificity. Intra-rater reliability of the mobile application forward head posture had an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.88. The inter-rater reliability generated an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 to 0.89. Criterion validity data were above 0.82. The minimum detectable change was 4.96° for intra-rater and 5.52° for inter-rater reliability. The smartphone application exhibited 94.4% sensitivity and 84.6% specificity. The smartphone application forward head posture is a valid and reliable tool to measure craniovertebral angle in a standing position and, therefore, could be a useful assessment tool in clinical practice."

  "abstract": "Purpose: This study sought to investigate associations among progressive temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA), airway dimensions, and head and neck posture.\nMaterials and methods: In total, 114 temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) patients were enrolled. Among 114 patients, 28 had no pathologic bony changes in the TMJ condyles (TMDnoOA), 45 had progressive TMJ OA (TMJOApro), and 41 demonstrated TMJ OA which had not progressed for 12 months (TMJOAnopro). TMJ OA was diagnosed based on the Diagnostic Criteria for TMD axis I. Computed tomography (CT) images and lateral cephalograms were obtained at baseline (T0) and 12 months after treatment (T1). The head and neck posture and airway area in upright position were analyzed using lateral cephalograms whereas airway volume in supine position was determined by 3D reconstructed CT images.\nResults: The volume change of the oropharynx in supine position was more prominent in the TMJOApro than in the TMDnoOA but no significant differences in changes in the pharyngeal airway while in upright position were detected. The retrognathic facial profile became more remarkable at T1 in the TMJOApro and TMJOAnopro compared to those at T0. The forward head posture seemed to be progressed in the TMJOApro than in either the TMJOAnopro or TMDnoOA.\nConclusion: Progressive TMJ OA may have associations with retrognathia and decreased oropharyngeal airway volume in the supine position but not in the upright position. Progressive TMJ OA may be related with altered head posture in the upright position to compensate for reduced airway dimensions."

Measurements on MMO (intra- and extra orally), Active range of motion of shoulders and neck, 30 Seconds Chair Stand Test, Grip Strength, Timed Up and Go test, and Six Minute Walk test.\nResults: In total 50 participants were included. The mean age was 68.6. ± 9.9 years and median time since end of treatment was 3.0 years (Q1-Q3: 1.0-5.25 years). We found good to excellent test-retest reliability on the core set of measurements (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) 0.77 to 0.98). Measurement of MMO with cardboard card, forward flexion shoulder and Six Minute Walk test had a relatively small measurement error (Smallest Detectable Change (SDC) % 5.4% - 15.1%). Measurement of MMO with a caliper, shoulder abduction, shoulder external rotation, later flexion and rotation of the neck, grip strength, 30 Seconds Chair Stand Test, and Timed up and Go test had a relatively large measurement error (SDC% 19.8% - 44.7%).\nConclusion: This core set of measurements on physical performance is found reliable and therefore able to differentiate in physical performance. The reported measurement errors should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of repeated measurements.\nImplications for cancer survivors: A core set of physical measurements can be used to measure physical performance in survivors of Head and Neck Cancer."

  "title": "A Comparison Study of Posture and Fatigue of Neck According to Monitor Types (Moving and Fixed Monitor) by Using Flexion Relaxation Phenomenon (FRP) and Craniovertebral Angle (CVA)",
  "date": "2020 Aug 31",
  "abstract": "This study quantified the neck posture and fatigue using the flexion relaxation phenomenon (FRP) and craniovertebral angle (CVA); further, it compared the difference between the level of fatigue and neck posture induced by two types of monitors (regular fixed monitor and moving monitor). Twenty-three male participants were classified into two groups-the low-flexion relaxation ratio (FRR) group and the normal-FRR group, depending on the FRR value. All participants performed a document task for 50 min using both types of monitors. It was found that the FRR values significantly decreased after the documentation task. The CVA analysis showed that the moving monitor's frequency of forward head posture (FHP) was lower than that for the fixed monitor. Overall, the moving monitor worked better than the fixed monitor; this can be interpreted as proof that such monitors can reduce neck fatigue."

  "date": "2020 Jul-Aug",
  "abstract": "Objective: In this cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study, we sought to compare the ultrasonic thickness of the masseter muscle in people with severe forward head posture vs people without forward head posture, and to determine sex differences in muscle thickness.\nMethods: Thirty-eight volunteers (19 with normal head postures and 19 with severe forward head postures), aged 18 to 35 years, entered the study. The severity of the forward head posture was measured by a plumb line and the craniovertebral angle drawn on the recorded images. Based on the recorded images, the masseter muscle thickness was also measured by a 7.5-MHz linear transducer using an ultrasound device in the seated position with 3 mouth positions (closed, half open, and fully open).\nResults: The results showed that the head posture affects masseter thickness significantly (P = .01), with masseter thickness significantly lower in the participants without severe forward head postures compared to those with severe forward head postures in the closed, half-open, and fully open mouth positions (P < .05). Comparing the mean masseter thickness across sexes showed that the masseter muscle is significantly thicker in men compared to women (P = .01).\nConclusion: Head posture and thickness of the masseter muscle are linked, as the masseter muscle was thicker in all 3 positions in the participants with severe forward head postures."

  "title": "Fall-related measures in elderly individuals and Parkinson's disease subjects",
  "date": "2020 Aug 13",
  "abstract": "Falls pose a serious problem in elderly and clinical populations. Most often, they lead to a loss of mobility and independence. They might also be an indirect cause of death. The aim of this study was to determine an objective predictor of the fear of falling and falls in elderly subjects (ESs) and Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects. Thirty-two ESs were examined in this study, of whom sixteen were diagnosed with PD. The testing procedures comprised force plate measurements (limit of stability test-LOS test) and clinical tests (Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach Test, Timed Up and Go test, Tinetti test). The Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) was used to evaluate the fear of falling. The range of the maximum forward lean was normalized to the length from the ankle joint to the head of the first metatarsal bone and was named the functional forward stability indicator (FFSI). The FFSI, derived from the LOS test, allowed us to demonstrate the real deficit in functional stability and individual safety margins. Moreover, the FFSI was highly correlated with the FES-I score and almost all clinical test results in elderly subjects (r>0,6; p<0.05). In PD subjects, the FFSI was poorly correlated with the fear of falling, the BBS score and the FR distance; however, a high correlation with the Tinetii test (r>0,6, p<0.05) was noted. The PD subjects presented a different balance strategy when close to their stability limits, which was also reflected in the lower values of sample entropy (t = (-2.40); p<0.05; d = 0.87). The FFSI might be a good predictor of the fear of falling in the group of elderly people. Additionally, the FFSI allows us to show real balance deficits both in PD subjects and in their healthy peers without the need for a reference group and norms. In conclusion, it is postulated that the popular clinical assessments of postural balance in PD subjects should be accompanied by reliable posturography measurements."

  "title": "Effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions to treat orthostatic hypotension in elderly people and people with a neurological condition: a systematic review",
  "date": "2020 Dec",
  "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this review was to summarize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions to treat orthostatic hypotension (OH) in elderly people and people with a neurological condition.\nIntroduction: Orthostatic hypotension is common in elderly people and people with a neurological condition and can interfere with or limit rehabilitation. Non-pharmacological interventions to treat OH could allow for longer and earlier mobilization, which is recommended in national clinical guidelines for rehabilitation in the acute or sub-acute phase following stroke or other neurological conditions.\nInclusion criteria: The review considered people aged 50 years and older, and people aged 18 years and elderly people with a neurological condition. Non-pharmacological interventions to treat OH included compression garments, neuromuscular stimulation, physical counter-maneuvers, aerobic or resistance exercises, sleeping with head tilted up, increasing fluid and salt intake, and timing and size of meals. The comparator was usual care, no intervention, pharmacological interventions, or other non-pharmacological interventions. Outcome measures included systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cerebral blood flow, observed/perceived symptoms, duration of standing or sitting in minutes, tolerance of therapy, functional ability, and adverse events/effects.\nMethods: Databases for published and unpublished studies available in English up to April 2018 with no lower date limit were searched. Critical appraisal was conducted using standardized instruments from JBI. Data were extracted using standardized tools designed for quantitative studies. Where appropriate, studies were included in a meta-analysis; otherwise, data were presented in a narrative form due to heterogeneity.\nResults: Forty-three studies - a combination of randomized controlled trials (n = 13), quasi-experimental studies (n = 28), a case control study (n = 1), and a case report (n = 1) - with 1069 participants were included. Meta-analyses of three interventions (resistance exercise, electrical stimulation, and lower limb compression bandaging) showed no significant effect of these interventions. Results from individual studies indicated physical maneuvers such as leg crossing, leg muscle pumping/contractions, and bending forward improved orthostatic hypotension. Abdominal compression improved OH. Sleeping with head up in combination with pharmacological treatment was more effective than sleeping with head up alone. Eating smaller, more frequent meals was effective. Drinking 480 mL of water increased blood pressure.\nConclusions: The review found mixed results for the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions to treat OH in people aged 50 years and older, and people with a neurological condition. There are several non-pharmacological interventions that may be effective in treating OH, but not all have resulted in clinically meaningful changes in outcome. Some may not be suitable for people with moderate to severe disability; therefore, it is important for clinicians to consider the patient's abilities and impairments when considering which non-pharmacological interventions to implement."

  "title": "The effects of forward head posture on expiratory muscle strength in chronic neck pain patients: A cross-sectional study",
  "date": "2020 May 18",
  "abstract": "Objectives: This study aims to investigate the relationship between forward head posture (FHP) and respiratory dysfunctions in patients with chronic neck pain.\nPatients and methods: Between June 2014 and November 2016 , a total of 99 patients (11 males, 88 females; mean age 54.1±9 years; range, 38 to 75 years) with chronic neck pain were evaluated for head posture by cervical lateral radiograph measuring the anterior head translation distance (FHPmm) and C7 vertebrae position (C7°). We examined the chest expansion by subtracting chest circumference from the level of xiphoid during maximal inspiration and expiration. Pain severity and neck disability were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and modified Neck Disability Index (MNDI), respectively. The respiratory functions were evaluated using spirometry tests, lung volumes, and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (Pimax and Pemax, respectively).\nResults: There was a negative correlation between the FHPmm with Pemax% (rho: -0.314; p=0.005). A negative correlation was also observed between C7° and Pemax, Pemax%, forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC)%, forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75%, and FEF75% (rho:-0.245, -0.349, -0.218, -0.214, and -0.259 respectively; p=0.028, 0.002, 0.035, 0.040, and 0.012, respectively). There was a positive correlation between neck disability and VAS scores (rho: 0.424; p<0.001), while there was a negative correlation between neck disability and chest expansion, maximum voluntary ventilation (rho: -0.201 and -0.217, respectively; p=0.049 and 0.046, respectively).\nConclusion: Based on our study results, FHP is associated with expiratory muscle weakness in chronic neck pain patients. To evaluate respiratory dysfunction, chest expansion tests may be useful, although these tests are not specific to muscle weakness. Interventions about FHP and neck pain should focus on the effects of respiratory muscle training."

  "title": "Plausible impact of forward head posture on upper cervical spine stability",
  "date": "2020 May 31",
  "abstract": "The cervical spine is responsible for allowing mobility and stability to the head and neck. Any deviation to the center of gravity of the head results in an increase in cantilever loads, which can be particularly damaging to the upper cervical joints. Excessive neck bending also exaggerates stretching through the cervical spine and all of the spinal structures below. It has been reported that forward head posture (FHP) can cause a multitude of disorders including cervical radiculopathy, cervicogenic headaches and cervicogenic dizziness. Most of these conditions manifest with clusters of painful symptoms and spine dysfunctions. The purpose of this case study is to describe the radiographic imaging considerations and to illustrate the potential impacts in symptomatic adults with FHP. We randomly selected radiographs of three individuals with FHP who had undergone cervical adjustment for cervical pain. The occipito-axial (C0-C2) and atlanto-axial (C1-C2) joints were assessed via the C0-2 distance from the C2 base to the McGregor line (Redlund-Johnell criterion) and the Ranawat C1-2 index, in addition to subjective radiographic parameters. By comparing the radiographs of before-and-after intervention of each patient, a regressive joint spacing was observed from both indices. Such a long-lasting stretching concordant with FHP was assumed to be hazardous to joint stability. A definite conclusion, however, cannot be drawn due to the small sample size and a lack of convincing measurements."

  "date": "2020 Jul 28",
  "abstract": "Cervical stabilization exercises are frequently used to reduce pain, maximize function, and improve physical impairments for people with nonspecific neck pain. We conducted a single arm study to evaluate the effects of a home-based cervical stabilization exercise program for university violin players with nonspecific neck pain who frequently assume an asymmetrical neck posture and activate their superficial cervical flexors to stabilize the violin. Twenty violin players with nonspecific neck pain from university symphony orchestras participated in this study. All participants received assessments twice before the intervention and once immediately after a 6-week cervical stabilization exercise program. No significant differences were found between the two pretests before the intervention. After the intervention, the Numeric Rating Scale, the Neck Disability Index, the craniocervical flexion test, muscle endurance tests, cervical range of motion (all directions except flexion) tests, and cervicocephalic relocation tests (flexion and left rotation) showed improvements. The forward head posture indicated by the craniovertebral angle also slightly improved. The results of this single arm study suggest that cervical stabilization exercise is feasible and has the potential to improve physical health for collegiate violin players with nonspecific neck pain."

  "abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of corrective exercises on posture, pain, and muscle activation of patients with chronic neck pain exposed to anterior-posterior perturbation.\nMethods: A total of 32 women (37.76 ± 3.83 years) with chronic, nonspecific neck pain were randomized into corrective exercise and control groups. The experimental group underwent a corrective exercise program for 8 weeks, 30 min/d, 3 days per week. The control group received active self-exercise instructions. Neck pain, forward head and protracted shoulder posture, and timing of superficial neck muscle activation were evaluated using the visual analog scale, photogrammetry, and electromyogram, respectively, before and then 48 hours after the 8-week program for both the experimental and control groups.

  "date": "2020 Jul 24",
  "abstract": "After a stroke, forward head posture occurs, resulting in swallowing dysfunction. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) combined with upper cervical spine mobilization has demonstrated enhanced recovery of the swallowing function in stroke patients. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of NMES in conjunction with upper cervical mobilization in stroke patients with dysphagia. Thirty-four stroke patients were recruited (in a randomized controlled clinical trial) and divided into an experimental group (n = 17; NMES plus upper cervical spine mobilization) and a control group (n = 17; NMES plus sham mobilization). Forward head posture was measured by craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) and craniovertebral angle (CVA). Swallowing function was measured by variations in video fluoroscopic dysphagia scale (VDS) and penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) scores using the video fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). All measurements were done at baseline and after four weeks of NMES plus mobilization. A significant increase was observed in CCFT, CVA, VDS (total VDS score, oral stage score, pharyngeal stage score), and PAS score in all variations in the experimental group. The CCFT, CVA, pharyngeal stage score, total VDS, and PAS score were significantly higher in the experimental group when compared to the control group. NMES plus upper cervical spine mobilization can be regarded as a promising method to improve swallowing function and forward head posture changes in stroke patients with dysphagia."

  "date": "2020 Sep 17",
  "abstract": "The head is an important element of the biokinetic chain. Under physiological conditions, it should extend along the midline of the body. Due to its location and the fact that it constitutes approx. 6% of the total body weight, many authors believe it has a significant impact on its functioning. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature search and to synthesize the evidence of the impact of the head posture on the functioning of the human body. A systematic review was conducted within 3 databases: PubMed, Medline OVID, and EBSCO, using the following terms: \"forward head,\" \"posture,\" \"position,\" and \"neck.\" For the analysis, scientific articles published after 2013 were selected. A total of 16 studies matched the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. Their results have proven that the position of the head has a significant effect on the human body. Research findings show that abnormal head position changes affect muscle activity, proprioception, the pattern of breathing and neck pain. This is the first systematic review of the relationship between the head posture, and the functioning of the human body. The results of this study seem to be promising if used in therapeutic practice. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2020;33(5):559-68."

  "title": "Chest ultrasonography versus supine chest radiography for diagnosis of pneumothorax in trauma patients in the emergency department",
  "date": "2020 Jul 23",
  "abstract": "Background: Chest X-ray (CXR) is a longstanding method for the diagnosis of pneumothorax but chest ultrasonography (CUS) may be a safer, more rapid, and more accurate modality in trauma patients at the bedside that does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. This may lead to improved and expedited management of traumatic pneumothorax and improved patient safety and clinical outcomes.\nObjectives: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of chest ultrasonography (CUS) by frontline non-radiologist physicians versus chest X-ray (CXR) for diagnosis of pneumothorax in trauma patients in the emergency department (ED). To investigate the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity such as type of CUS operator (frontline non-radiologist physicians), type of trauma (blunt vs penetrating), and type of US probe on test accuracy.\nSearch methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of the following electronic databases from database inception to 10 April 2020: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Web of Science Core Collection and Clinicaltrials.gov. We handsearched reference lists of included articles and reviews retrieved via electronic searching; and we carried out forward citation searching of relevant articles in Google Scholar and looked at the \"Related articles\" on PubMed.\nSelection criteria: We included prospective, paired comparative accuracy studies comparing CUS performed by frontline non-radiologist physicians to supine CXR in trauma patients in the emergency department (ED) suspected of having pneumothorax, and with computed tomography (CT) of the chest or tube thoracostomy as the reference standard.\nData collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data from each included study using a data extraction form. We included studies using patients as the unit of analysis in the main analysis and we included those using lung fields in the secondary analysis. We performed meta-analyses by using a bivariate model to estimate and compare summary sensitivities and specificities.\nMain results: We included 13 studies of which nine (410 traumatic pneumothorax patients out of 1271 patients) used patients as the unit of analysis; we thus included them in the primary analysis. The remaining four studies used lung field as the unit of analysis and we included them in the secondary analysis. We judged all studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in one or more domains, with most studies (11/13, 85%) being judged at high or unclear risk of bias in the patient selection domain. There was substantial heterogeneity in the sensitivity of supine CXR amongst the included studies. In the primary analysis, the summary sensitivity and specificity of CUS were 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.94) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00); and the summary sensitivity and specificity of supine CXR were 0.47 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.63) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00). There was a significant difference in the sensitivity of CUS compared to CXR with an absolute difference in sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.61; P < 0.001). In contrast, CUS and CXR had similar specificities: comparing CUS to CXR, the absolute difference in specificity was -0.007 (95% CI -0.018 to 0.005, P = 0.35). The findings imply that in a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients if 30 patients have traumatic pneumothorax (i.e. prevalence of 30%), CUS would miss 3 (95% CI 2 to 4) cases (false negatives) and overdiagnose 1 (95% CI 0 to 2) of those without pneumothorax (false positives); while CXR would miss 16 (95% CI 11 to 21) cases with 0 (95% CI 0 to 2) overdiagnosis of those who do not have pneumothorax.\nAuthors' conclusions: The diagnostic accuracy of CUS performed by frontline non-radiologist physicians for the diagnosis of pneumothorax in ED trauma patients is superior to supine CXR, independent of the type of trauma, type of CUS operator, or type of CUS probe used. These findings suggest that CUS for the diagnosis of traumatic pneumothorax should be incorporated into trauma protocols and algorithms in future medical training programmes; and that CUS may beneficially change routine management of trauma."

Experiment 1 was a pilot study of adults that was conducted to determine the appropriate experimental settings for the main experiment that included children and adults. The adult participants experienced vection in four different directions in the head-centered coordinate (forward, backward, upward, and downward) under two postural conditions: standing (in which the body and gravitational axes were consistent) and supine (in which the body orientation was orthogonally aligned to the gravitational axis). The adults reported more rapid and longer lasting vection when standing than when supine. In the main experiment (Experiment 2), we tested adults and school-age children under conditions similar to those of Experiment 1 and found that the reported vection was more rapid and longer lasting in children than in adults, whereas the reported vection tended to be more rapid and longer lasting under the standing condition than the supine condition for both age groups. Based on the similarities and differences between children and adults found in the present and previous vection studies, child-specific features of vection are discussed."

  "date": "2020 Oct 12",
  "abstract": "Objective: Recent studies have suggested that a relationship exists between crash injury risk and occupant posture, particularly in postures different from those used with anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) in crash testing. The objective of this study was to increase scientific understanding of typical front-seat passenger postures through a naturalistic study.\nMethod: Video cameras were installed in the passenger cabins of the vehicles of 75 drivers. Reflective targets were attached to the seats and the seat position and seat back angle was moved through their available ranges during instrumentation. The video data, along with vehicle acceleration and location data, were downloaded after the vehicles were operated as usual by their owners for two weeks. Video frames were manually coded to identify characteristics of front-seat passenger posture and position. Seat position and seat back angle were estimated using the calibration data obtained during vehicle instrumentation.\nResults: Video frames from a total of 2733 trips were coded for 306 unique front-seat passengers. For these trips, a total of 13638 frames were coded; each frame represents about four minutes of travel time. The head was rotated left or right in 33% of frames, and the torso was rotated left or right about 10% of the time and pitched forward in almost 10% of frames. No seat position or seat back angle change was noted in 40 (53%) of vehicles and the distributions of seat position and seat back angle on arrival were essentially unchanged during travel. The seat was positioned full-rear on the seat track about 23% of the time and rearward of the mid-track position in 92% of frames. The mean seat back angle was 25.4 degrees (standard deviation 6.4 degrees); seat back angle was greater than 30 degrees in 15% of frames and greater than 35 degrees in less than 1% of frames.\nConclusions: This study is the first to report distributions of postures, seat positions, and seat back angles for front-seat passengers. Seat positions rearward of the middle of the seat adjustment range are common, but highly reclined postures are infrequent. Non-nominal torso and head postures also are nontrivial."

  "abstract": "Lumbar and pelvic alignment may have a huge impact on the posture of the spine and other parts. The aim of this study were to compare the spinal curvature of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine and the muscle activity of the cervical erector spinae muscle, upper trapezius muscle, and thoracic erector spinae muscle when sitting at 3 different sloped, seating surfaces. A 10° wedge was used as the seating surface and we compared a forward sloping seat surface, a flat seating surface, and a rear sloping seat surface, in that order. Twenty healthy officers were recruited for this study. The subjects sat on the seat of 3 different slopes and watched a total of 3 videos, 10 minutes each. The rest time was 10 minutes. Subjects were photographed while viewing videos and muscle activity was measured. There were significant differences in cervical, thoracic, lumbar curvatures, and muscle activity in the 3 different sitting positions according to seat tilt (P < .05). Among the 3 slopes, the forward slope decreased forward head posture and cervical erector spinae muscle activity (P < .05). The activity of the cervical erector spinae muscle was 2.67% with a forward sloping seat, 5.45% with a flat sloping seat, and 6.77% with a rear sloping seat, revealing a significant difference (P < .05). This suggests that a forward sloping seat surface was effective in maintaining a neutral alignment of the spine, and this decreased the cervical spine erector muscle activity. Based on this result, equipment and chair development to incline seats forward may improve posture and health, and prevent chronic pain."

Mean FVC, FEV1, and FEV6 were significantly lower in addicted versus non-addicted boys (P = 0.04, P = 0.05, and P = 0.02, respectively). PImax was significantly less in addicted compared to non-addicted girls (55.2 ± 16.4 vs 65.3 ± 13.8, η2 = 0.7, P = 0.05).\nConclusion: Our findings showed that children addicted to smartphones (when using the SAS-SV as an indicator for addiction) revealed lower CVA and lung function results. Therefore, education on proper posture while holding smartphones is essential to the children's postural and lung function status."

  "title": "Development of a Computerized Device for Evaluating Vestibular Function in Locomotion: A New Evaluation Tool of Vestibular Hypofunction",
  "date": "2020 Jun 12",
  "abstract": "To evaluate vestibular function in the clinic, current assessments are applied under static conditions, such as with the subject in a sitting or supine position. Considering the complexities of daily activities, the combination of dynamic activities, dynamic visual acuity (DVA) and postural control could produce an evaluation that better reflects vestibular function in daily activities. Objective: To develop a novel sensor-based system to investigate DVA, walking trajectory, head and trunk movements and the chest-pelvis rotation ratio during forward and backward overground walking in both healthy individuals and patients with vestibular hypofunction. Methods: Fifteen healthy subjects and 7 patients with bilateral vestibular hypofunction (BVH) were recruited for this study. Inertial measurement units were placed on each subject's head and torso. Each subject walked forward and backward for 5 m twice with 2 Hz head yaw. Our experiment comprised 2 stages. In stage 1, we measured forward (FW), backward (BW), and medial-lateral (MLW) walking trajectories; head and trunk movements; and the chest-pelvis rotation ratio. In stage 2, we measured standing and locomotion DVA (loDVA). Using Mann-Whitney U-test, we compared the abovementioned parameters between the 2 groups. Results: Patients exhibited an in-phase chest/pelvis reciprocal rotation ratio only in FW. The walking trajectory deviation, calculated by normalizing the summation of medial-lateral swaying with 1/2 body height (%), was significantly larger (FW mean ± standard deviation: 20.4 ± 7.1% (median (M)/interquartile range (IQR): 19.3/14.4-25.2)in healthy vs. 43.9 ± 27. 3% (M/IQR: 36.9/21.3-56.9) in patients, p = 0.020)/(BW mean ± standard deviation: 19.2 ± 11.5% (M/IQR: 13.6/10.4-25.3) in healthy vs. 29.3 ± 6.4% (M/IQR: 27.7/26.5-34.4) in patients, p = 0.026), and the walking DVA was also significantly higher (LogMAR score in the patient group [FW LogMAR: rightDVA: mean ± standard deviation:0.127 ± 0.081 (M/IQR: 0.127/0.036-0.159) in healthy vs. 0.243 ± 0.101 (M/IQR: 0.247/0.143-0.337) in patients (p = 0.013) and leftDVA: 0.136 ± 0.096 (M/IQR: 0.127/0.036-0.176) in healthy vs. 0.258 ± 0.092 (M/IQR: 0.247/0.176-0.301) in patients (p = 0.016); BW LogMAR: rightDVA: mean ± standard deviation: 0.162 ± 0.097 (M/IQR: 0.159/0.097-0.273) in healthy vs. 0.281 ± 0.130 (M/IQR: 0.273/0.176-0.418) in patients(p = 0.047) and leftDVA: 0.156 ± 0.101 (M/IQR: 0.159/0.097-0.198) in healthy vs. 0.298 ± 0.153 (M/IQR: 0.2730/0.159-0.484) in patients (p = 0.038)]. Conclusions: Our sensor-based vestibular evaluation system provided a more functionally relevant assessment for the identification of BVH patients."

  "title": "Constraints of Load and Posture on Coordination Variability and Marksmanship Performance",
  "date": "2020 Jun 21",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the establishment of dynamic marksmanship performance under different load and postural configurations. Participants quickly established two postures (forward and high targets) under head, trunk, and extremity loads during marksmanship performance. With the dynamic establishment of posture, load disrupted coordinative dynamics, resulting in reduced speed and accuracy on target. Specifically, torso loads increased segmental variability while establishing posture, and smaller head and upper extremity loads extended quieting time before firing. Increased head extension at the high target further destabilized posture, with reduced accuracy across all loads. Large torso loads reduced the adaptability to modulate postural fluctuations at the foot center of pressure while establishing postures for marksmanship, as evidenced by reductions in center of pressure variability. This study expands traditional static marksmanship research, providing insight into relations between task performance, coordinative variability, and postural control while dynamically establishing precision postures."

  "date": "2020 Jun 23",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate if there are sex differences in postures of upper arm, upper back, head and neck after muscle fatigue induced by a simulated work task, requiring upper arm movements performed above shoulder level. Nineteen females and 18 males were evaluated. Upper arm elevation, upper back, head and neck forward flexion postures were recorded using digital inclinometers. The first and the last cycles of the task were considered as pre- and post-fatigue periods, respectively. For both periods, Amplitude Probability Distribution Function (APDF) was calculated for 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles, as well as the angular ranges between the 5th and 95th percentiles (APDF5-95 range). The APDF5-95 range for upper arm elevation was higher with fatigue, but with a higher increase for males. After fatigue, there was also a decrease in the upper arm elevation, with a larger decrease in males for the 10th and 50th percentiles. For head and neck, females showed higher APDF5-95 ranges than males, regardless of the task period evaluated. After muscle fatigue, males adopted more neutral postures of the upper arm than females. Furthermore, females showed more non-neutral postures for head and neck. These findings suggest that the kinematic strategies adopted by females and males during a simulated work task are different and may predispose females to a higher risk of developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the neck."

  "title": "A temporary forward head posture decreases function of cervical proprioception",
  "date": "2020 Apr 28",
  "abstract": "Increased use of smartphones can cause abnormal alignment of head and neck, resulting in forward head posture (FHP). This can lead to change in the structures and function of the cervical vertebrae. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact on deep neck flexor muscles, proprioception, vestibular function, and balance of subjects with induced FHP by using smartphone. Twenty-two healthy persons were randomly divided into two groups. The FHP group maintained a craniovertebral angle (CVA) of <49° and a normal head posture group maintained a CVA of >50° watching the smartphone for 40 min. We measured the area of the longus colli and longus capitis muscles, cervical joint position sense, Romberg test, subjective visual vertical test, and subjective visual horizontal test. There was no significant difference in the deep neck flexor muscles, vestibular function, and static balance between the groups. However, there was a significant difference in the cervical proprioception (P<0.05). Proprioception may be considered to be the most influential factor in induced FHP by smartphone viewing."

  "date": "2020 Aug",
  "abstract": "Background: Hyperkyphosis may cause balance impairment in elderly people. Although the effectiveness of orthoses for improving balance in hyperkyphotic elderly people has received much attention, the mechanisms by which devices affect balance remain unknown.\nObjectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in balance performance, thoracic kyphosis angle, craniovertebral angle, back muscle endurance and joint position sense after 3 months of wearing a Spinomed orthosis. The study also included a secondary exploratory analysis to determine whether changes in any of the above-mentioned outcome measures can predict balance performance improvement in elderly people with hyperkyphosis.\nStudy design: Parallel group randomized controlled trial.\nMethods: In total, 44 hyperkyphotic elderly people were randomly allocated to an experimental group, who wore a Spinomed orthosis and a control group, who did not. No other treatment or change in physical activity was permitted during the study. A blinded assessor evaluated thoracic kyphosis angle, joint position sense, craniovertebral angle, back muscle endurance, Timed Up and Go Test time and Berg Balance Scale score at baseline and after 5, 9 and 13 weeks. All dependent variables were measured without the orthosis and analyzed separately using a 2 × 4 (time × group) mixed model analysis of variance. Based on the results of correlation analysis, thoracic kyphosis angle, back muscle endurance and joint position sense were selected as independent variables in a stepwise multiple regression model.\nResults: The two-way (group × time) interactions were significant in terms of Berg Balance Scale (F = 11.6, P ⩽ 0.001,\nη\np\n2\n=\n0\n.\n59\n), Timed Up and Go Test (F = 3.74, P = 0.013,\nη\np\n2\n=\n0\n.\n46\n), thoracic kyphosis angle (F = 43.39, P ⩽ 0.001,\nη\np\n2\n=\n0\n.\n96\n), craniovertebral angle (F = 5.245, P = 0.002,\nη\np\n2\n=\n0\n.\n59\n) and joint position sense (F = 4.44, P = 0.005, [Formula: see text]). The two-way interaction was not significant in terms of back muscle endurance; however, the main effect of group was significant for this variable (F = 3.85, P = 0.025). Stepwise multiple regression showed that thoracic kyphosis angle and joint position sense were significant determinants of Timed Up and Go Test time (R2 = 0.155, P = 0.037 and R2 = 0.292, P = 0.012, respectively).\nConclusion: Wearing a Spinomed orthosis for 3 months improved the posture, position sense and muscle performance of hyperkyphotic elderly people. Orthoses may improve balance performance by correcting spinal alignment and increasing proprioceptive information."

  "date": "2020 Jun 4",
  "abstract": "The vestibular system is essential to produce adequate postural responses enabling voluntary movement. However, how the vestibular system influences corticospinal output during postural tasks is still unknown. Here, we examined the modulation exerted by the vestibular system on corticospinal output during standing. Healthy subjects (n = 25) maintained quiet standing, head facing forward with eyes closed. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was applied bipolarly and binaurally at different delays prior to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) which triggered motor evoked potentials (MEPs). With the cathode right/anode left configuration, MEPs in right Soleus (SOL) muscle were significantly suppressed when GVS was applied at ISI = 40 and 130ms before TMS. With the anode right/cathode left configuration, no significant changes were observed. Changes in the MEP amplitude were then compared to changes in the ongoing EMG when GVS was applied alone. Only the decrease in MEP amplitude at ISI = 40ms occurred without change in the ongoing EMG, suggesting that modulation occurred at a premotoneuronal level. We further investigated whether vestibular modulation could occur at the motor cortex level by assessing changes in the direct corticospinal pathways using the short-latency facilitation of the SOL Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) by TMS. None of the observed modulation occurred at the level of motor cortex. Finally, using the long-latency facilitation of the SOL H-reflex, we were able to confirm that the suppression of MEP at ISI = 40ms occurred at a premotoneuronal level. The data indicate that vestibular signals modulate corticospinal output to SOL at both premotoneuronal and motoneuronal levels during standing."

  "abstract": "Tongue strength has an important role in the swallowing process, and previous research has suggested that tongue position, concerning the craniomandibular region, could affect the oral function. This study aimed to evaluate the strength and endurance of three areas of the tongue in three experimentally induced craniocervical postures. A cross-sectional study with a nonprobabilistic sample of 37 participants (mean age: 3.85 ± 3.64 years; 20 men, 17 women) was performed. Tongue strength and endurance were assessed using a pressure device entitled Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI), in three different craniocervical positions: neutral head position (NHP), anterior head translation-or forward head position (FHP), and posterior head translation-or retracted head position (RHP). Measurements taken using the IOPI system showed significant differences in tongue strength for the anterior (p = 0.015) and middle areas of the tongue (p = 0.01). Significant differences were observed in analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the FHP (p = 0.02) and NHP (p = 0.009). The results of tongue endurance measurements showed statistically significant differences for FHP (p = 0.001), NHP (p = 0.00), and RHP (p = 0.007). The craniocervical position influences tongue strength, especially in the anterior and middle tongue areas, concerning the posterior, and, in the anterior and neutral head posture, regarding the retracted position. No differences were found in tongue resistance between the various craniocervical positions, but differences were found in resistance between the different tongue areas."

  "abstract": "This study analyses tail and ear postures of growing pigs in two different housing systems throughout the growing period. On one farm, 168 undocked pigs (84: barren housing, 84: enriched housing) were observed individually at three time periods: beginning, middle and end of the growing period. By scan sampling, the tail (curled-up, raised, hanging, tucked under, wagging) and ear posture (forwards, sidewards, backwards, mixed) was noted. Scans were performed hourly during the activity periods by direct observation. Moreover, the body posture (standing, feeding, lying (eyes open), lying (eyes closed) and tail lesions were noted. Data were analysed using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS. Results revealed significant differences between the enriched and barren group especially for curled-up tails, tucked under tails and ears directed forwards. More curled-up tails and ears directed forwards occurred in the enriched and more tucked under tails in the barren habitat. The time period of observation also had significant influences. Tail lesions had significant effects on most tail postures. Most ear postures were influenced by the body posture of the pigs. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of body language, specifically tail and ear postures in pigs."

  "abstract": "Objectives: The present study purposed to observe the response of comorbidities of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) including migraine and cervical dysfunction after painful TMD treatment.\nDesign: A total of 187 patients were included: 45 had no symptoms related to the painful TMD and migraine (Control), 52 had the painful TMD only (pTMD), 47 had the painful TMD that occurred earlier than the migraine (TMD1ST), and 43 had the migraine that occurred earlier than the painful TMD (MIG1ST). All patients were diagnosed based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders and International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition. Head and neck posture were assessed using lateral cephalogram. Myofascial trigger points were evaluated in the two masticatory and four cervical muscles. Stabilization splint therapy and physical therapy were applied to all patients for six months.\nResults: MIG1ST showed lesser improvement of the intensity of the orofacial and neck pain and forward head posture than the pTMD and TMD1ST after 6 months TMD treatment. In addition, lesser degree of symptomatic progress of intensity, duration and frequency of the migraine in MIG1ST was detected than in TMD1ST after 6 months TMD treatment.\nConclusion: The effects of TMD management on symptomatic changes of its comorbidities including the migraine and cervical dysfunction could be determined by onset order of comorbid conditions relative to TMD."

  "date": "2020",
  "abstract": "Objective: Up to one-half of drivers swerve before a crash, which may cause vehicle motions that displace an occupant from a normal seated position. How these altered postures affect occupant restraint in a crash is unknown. The goal of this study was to quantify the effect of an initial inboard lean on occupant kinematics in a frontal impact.Methods: 30 km/h frontal impact tests were performed with three postmortem human subjects (PMHS) seated in a neutral, upright posture and in a 20° inboard-leaning posture identified from simulated swerving tests with human volunteers.Results: In comparison to the upright posture, the inboard-leaning posture increased the initial distance from the D-ring to the belted shoulder by 105-156 mm. In the inboard-leaning tests, the occupant's head displaced 45-70 mm farther forward than in the upright tests and was also located 123-147 mm farther inboard at the time of maximum forward excursion. The peak resultant velocity of the occupant's head relative to the vehicle interior increased 1.40-1.54 m/s in the inboard-leaning tests.Conclusions: The posture-induced increase in the distance between the D-ring and the shoulder permitted the increased maximum forward head displacement and increased maximum head resultant velocity relative to the vehicle interior. Thus, an initial inboard lean in a frontal impact may increase the risk and severity of a head strike to the vehicle interior, and alter the location, timing, and nature of airbag engagement."

  "date": "2020 Mar 24",
  "abstract": "Background and objectives: Increased fall risk in older adults is associated with declining balance. Previous work showed that brief postural instructions can affect balance control in older adults with Parkinson's disease. Here, we assessed the effects of brief instructions on static and dynamic balance in healthy older adults.\nResearch design and methods: Nineteen participants practiced three sets of instructions, then attempted to implement each instructional set during: (1) quiet standing on foam for 30 s with eyes open; (2) a 3-s foot lift. \"Light\" instructions relied on principles of reducing excess tension while encouraging length. \"Effortful\" instructions relied on popular concepts of effortful posture correction. \"Relax\" instructions encouraged minimization of effort. We measured kinematics and muscle activity.\nResults: During quiet stance, Effortful instructions increased mediolateral jerk and path length. In the foot lift task, Light instructions led to the longest foot-in-air duration and the smallest anteroposterior variability of the center of mass, Relax instructions led to the farthest forward head position, and Effortful instructions led to the highest activity in torso muscles.\nDiscussion and implications: Thinking of upright posture as effortless may reduce excessive co-contractions and improve static and dynamic balance, while thinking of upright posture as inherently effortful may make balance worse. This may partly account for the benefits of embodied mindfulness practices such as tai chi and Alexander technique for balance in older adults. Pending larger-scale replication, this discovery may enable physiotherapists and teachers of dance, exercise, and martial arts to improve balance and reduce fall risk in their older students and clients simply by modifying how they talk about posture."

  "abstract": "Compound, or awkward, spine postures have been suggested as a biomechanical risk factor for low back injury. This experiment investigates the influence of head (i.e. head-on-torso) and gaze (i.e. eye-in-head) orientation on three-dimensional (3D) neck and spine range of motion (ROM) during forward flexion movements. To emulate previous experimental protocols and replicate real-world scenarios, a sample of ten young, healthy males (mean ± standard deviation: age: 20.8 ± 1.03 years, height: 180.2 ± 7.36 cm, and mass: 81.9 ± 6.47 kg) completed forward flexion movements with a constrained and unconstrained pelvis, respectively. Surface kinematics were gathered from the head and spine (C7-S1). Movements were completed under a baseline condition as well as upward, downward, leftward, and rightward head and gaze orientations. For each condition, mean neck angle and inter-segmental spine (C7T1 through L5S1) ROM were evaluated. The results demonstrate that directed head and gaze orientations can influence the ROM of specific spine regions during a forward flexion task. With leftward and rightward directed head and gaze orientations, the neck became increasingly twisted and superior thoracic segments (i.e. C7T1-T2T3) were significantly more twisted during the leftward head orientation condition than the baseline condition. With upward and downward directed head and gaze orientations, a similar effect was observed for neck and superior thoracic (i.e. C7T1-T4T5) flexion-extension. Interestingly, it was also demonstrated that changes in upward/downward head orientation can also change flexion-extension kinematics of the thoracolumbar region as well (i.e. T7T8-L1L2), suggesting that head postures requiring neck extension may also promote extension throughout these spine regions. These findings provide evidence for a functional link between changes in neck flexion-extension posture and flexion-extension movement of the thoracolumbar region of the spine."

This syndrome might contribute to the dysfunction of the cervicothoracic and glenohumeral joints.\nObjectives: The present study will aim to investigate the effectiveness of a comprehensive corrective exercises program (CCEP) and subsequent detraining on alignment, muscle activation and movement pattern in men with UCS.\nMethods/design: This is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Participants will be 22 men aged 18 to 28 years who are suffering from UCS. Participants in the intervention group will conduct CCEP (three times a week for 8 weeks), followed by 4 weeks of detraining. The control group will do their daily activities. Participants will be randomized (1:1) into the intervention or the control group. The primary outcome will be upper trapezius activations. Secondary outcomes consist of electromyography of middle and lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles, scapular dyskinesis test, forward head and shoulder angles, thoracic kyphosis angle, and neck flexion pattern test.\nDiscussion: We propose to evaluate the effectiveness of a randomized controlled trial of a CCEP in men with UCS on their alignment, selected muscle activations, and relevant movement patterns. Results from our trial may provide new insights into the effects of exercise not only on the alignment but also on muscle activation and movement patterns that are important outcomes for people with postural malalignments and, if successful, could assist therapists in evidence-based clinical decision-making.\nTrial registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials, IRCT20181004041232N1.

ADS patients undergo compensatory changes that can result in an altered gait pattern. RW are frequently prescribed, but result in a forward flexed kyphotic posture during ambulation. Gait using WS allows for more upright alignment in ADS patients.\nMethods: Fifty-three ADS patients with symptomatic degenerative scoliosis performed over-ground walking at self-selected speed with WS and with a RW. Trunk and lower extremity angles along with spatiotemporal parameters were measured and compared.\nResults: When using WS, patients exhibited less flexion at the head (WS: - 4.8° vs. RW: 11.0°, p = 0.001), and lumbar spine (WS: - 0.9° vs. RW: 4.2°, p = 0.001); while there was significantly more extension, of the cervical spine (WS: - 1.6° vs. RW: - 7.4°, p = 0.002) when using the RW. At the initial contact phase of gait, patients using WS showed decreased flexion at the ankle (WS 0.7° vs. RW: 3.8°, p = 0.018), knee (WS: 0.3° vs. RW: 4.8°, p = 0.001), hip (WS: 22.6° vs. RW: 27.3°, p = 0.001), and pelvis (WS: 10.2° vs. RW: 14.8°, p = 0.001). In contrast, the use of WS resulted in slower ambulation (WS: 0.6 m/s vs. RW: 0.7 m/s, p = 0.001).\nConclusions: In ADS patients who have not undergone surgical correction, the use of WS resulted in a more upright posture, which may be more beneficial to the compensatory changes that lead to gait disturbance in ADS patients. Ambulation using WS resulted in slower gait versus a RW, due to the momentum induced by the forward flexed posture when using a RW. We recommend the use of WS for patients with ADS as it improves gait kinematics and may be a safer option."

  "title": "Relationship between Forward Head Posture and Tissue Mechanosensitivity: A Cross-Sectional Study",
  "date": "2020 Feb 27",
  "abstract": "The relationship between forward head posture (FHP) and neck pain is not clear. FHP could possibly increase the mechanosensitivity of cervical tissues, which could lead to the development of pain depending on the adaptation capability of the central nervous system. The purpose of this study was to analyse the influence of FHP in the mechanosensitivity of articular, muscular, and neural tissues related to the cervical spine. The pressure pain threshold was bilaterally measured in different muscles and nerves and the second cervical vertebrae. The cervical spine's range of movement was also examined. The measurements were obtained from people with (n = 32) and without (n = 64) FHP. The analyses included a 2-by-2 mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA), pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction, and point-biserial correlation coefficients. Subjects with FHP showed a less pressure pain threshold (PPT) in all locations except for the upper trapezius and scalenus medius muscles. They also showed less extension and right-rotation range of motion. There was no association between FHP, neck pain, disability, and headache. Nevertheless, more research is needed to evaluate the relationship between FHP, tissue mechanosensitivity, and neck pain."

  "title": "Cervical Spine Hyperextension and Altered Posturo-Respiratory Coupling in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome",
  "date": "2020 Feb 7",
  "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with postural dysfunction characterized by abnormal spinal curvature and disturbance of balance and walking, whose pathophysiology is poorly understood. We hypothesized that it may be the result of a pathological interaction between postural and ventilatory functions. Twelve patients with OSAS (4 women, age 53 years [51-63] (median [quartiles]), apnea hypopnea index 31/h [24-41]) were compared with 12 healthy matched controls. Low dose biplanar X-rays (EOS® system) were acquired and personalized three-dimensional models of the spine and pelvis were reconstructed. We also estimated posturo-respiratory coupling by measurement of respiratory emergence, obtaining synchronized center of pressure data from a stabilometric platform and ventilation data recorded by an optico-electronic system of movement analysis. Compared with controls, OSAS patients, had cervical hyperextension with anterior projection of the head (angle OD-C7 12° [8; 14] vs. 5° [4; 8]; p = 0.002), and thoracic hyperkyphosis (angle T1-T12 65° [51; 71] vs. 49° [42; 59]; p = 0.039). Along the mediolateral axis: (1) center of pressure displacement was greater in OSAS patients, whose balance was poorer (19.2 mm [14.2; 31.5] vs. 8.5 [1.4; 17.8]; p = 0.008); (2) respiratory emergence was greater in OSAS patients, who showed increased postural disturbance of respiratory origin (19.2% [9.9; 24.0] vs. 8.1% [6.4; 10.4]; p = 0.028). These results are evidence for the centrally-mediated and primarily respiratory origin of the postural dysfunction in OSAS. It is characterized by an hyperextension of the cervical spine with a compensatory hyperkyphosis, and an alteration in posturo-respiratory coupling, apparently secondary to upper airway instability."

  "date": "2020 Apr",
  "abstract": "Recent research has shown that systematic postural adjustments occur during periods of manual motor imagery (MI), but the timing (anticipatory or reactive) and directionality (against or in the direction of arm extension) of these postural motions relative to individual manual actions or imagery are not well understood. This study analyzed the anteroposterior hip and head motion of healthy young and older participants, while they imagined bilateral arm raises under self-initiated or environmentally triggered performance conditions. When MI was self-initiated, both age groups showed significant forward postural motion during the second prior to MI initiation. When MI (or physical arm movement) was environmentally triggered, however, older people did not show anticipatory forward postural motion, but did show compensatory backward head motion. These results suggest that manual MI is indeed accompanied by anticipatory postural motion, but this anticipation is attenuated in older people when they do not have control over the timing of manual movement onset."

  "date": "2020 Apr-Jun",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The objectives of this pilot study were to analyze the electromyography (EMG) activity of masseter and anterior temporalis muscles during chewing in 2 different posture conditions: natural head posture (NHP) and maximum yet comfortable forward head posture (FHP) in healthy individuals; and to compare EMG activity between subjects based on their NHP during chewing.\nMethods: Fifteen subjects participated. Sagittal head posture in sitting position was clinically assessed using a plumb line. Participants were classified as having FHP or upright head posture (UP). Surface EMG was used to evaluate superficial masseter and anterior temporalis bilaterally during chewing in NHP and FHP. Three trials with five chewing cycles were recorded. EMG data were normalized using a maximum voluntary contraction. An independent t-test was used to calculate differences between sides. If no differences were found, both sides were analyzed together. To analyze differences between the 2 conditions, a paired t-test was used. Independent t-test was used to calculate difference between subjects with UP and FHP.\nResults: A significant increase in muscle activity was found for masseter muscle in the FHP condition. No differences were found in muscle activity in natural head position by posture classification. A trend of increased activity was observed for masseter and temporalis muscles during chewing in FHP.\nConclusion: Head and neck posture was found to influence masticatory muscle activity during the function of chewing. The results of this study may help clinicians to better understand the association between head and neck posture alterations with masticatory muscles related disorders."

  "title": "Child Posture and Belt Fit in a Range of Booster Configurations",
  "date": "2020 Jan 28",
  "abstract": "Belt positioning boosters reduce injury risk for child occupants compared with seat belts alone. While boosters shorten the effective seat length (and thus reduce slouching), \"boosting\" the child relative to the vehicle interior components also achieves additional safety benefits. First, the increase of the lap belt angle usually improves belt fit across the pelvis and reduces the risk of the occupant slipping (\"submarining\") under the belt. Second, the torso belt is re-centered over the bony landmarks of the shoulder for more effective/secure restraint. Third, the child's head is relocated in a range better protected by side airbags. The objective of this research was to quantify differences in posture and belt fit across a range of booster designs that provide different levels of boosting. Posture and belt fit were measured in 25 child volunteers aged four to 12. Children were measured in three laboratory seating conditions selected to provide a range of cushion lengths and belt geometries. Six different boosters, as well as a no-booster condition, were evaluated. The low height boosters produced postures that were more slouched, with the hips further forward than in other more typical boosters. Lap belt fit in the low height boosters was not meaningfully different from the other boosters. Shoulder belt fit produced by the lowest height booster was similar to the no-booster condition. Belt positioning boosters that boost the child less than 70 mm produced postures similar to the no-booster condition. While lap belt guides on these products can produce a similar static lap belt fit, they may not provide adequate dynamic performance and do not achieve the other benefits that come with raising the child to a more advantageous location relative to interior components and belts."

  "title": "Monitoring and Measurement of Intracranial Pressure in Pediatric Head Trauma",
  "date": "2020 Jan 14",
  "abstract": "Purpose of Review: Monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is an important and integrated part of the treatment algorithm for children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Guidelines often recommend ICP monitoring with a treatment threshold of 20 mmHg. This focused review discusses; (1) different ICP technologies and how ICP should be monitored in pediatric patients with severe TBI, (2) existing evidence behind guideline recommendations, and (3) how we could move forward to increase knowledge about normal ICP in children to support treatment decisions. Summary: Current reference values for normal ICP in adults lie between 7 and 15 mmHg. Recent studies conducted in \"pseudonormal\" adults, however, suggest a normal range below this level where ICP is highly dependent on body posture and decreases to negative values in sitting and standing position. Despite obvious physiological differences between children and adults, no age or body size related reference values exist for normal ICP in children. Recent guidelines for treatment of severe TBI in pediatric patients recommend ICP monitoring to guide treatment of intracranial hypertension. Decision on ICP monitoring modalities are based on local standards, the individual case, and the clinician's choice. The recommended treatment threshold is 20 mmHg for a duration of 5 min. Both prospective and retrospective observational studies applying different thresholds and treatment strategies for intracranial hypertension were included to support this recommendation. While some studies suggest improved outcome related to ICP monitoring (lower rate of mortality and severe disability), most studies identify high ICP as a marker of worse outcome. Only one study applied age-differentiated thresholds, but this study did not evaluate the effect of these different thresholds on outcome. The quality of evidence behind ICP monitoring and treatment thresholds in severe pediatric TBI is low and treatment can potentially be improved by knowledge about normal ICP from observational studies in healthy children and cohorts of pediatric \"pseudonormal\" patients expected to have normal ICP. Acceptable levels of ICP - and thus also treatment thresholds-probably vary with age, disease and whether the patient has intact cerebral autoregulation. Future treatment algorithms should reflect these differences and be more personalized and dynamic."

  "title": "Head motion predictability explains activity-dependent suppression of vestibular balance control",
  "date": "2020 Jan 20",
  "abstract": "Vestibular balance control is dynamically weighted during locomotion. This might result from a selective suppression of vestibular inputs in favor of a feed-forward balance regulation based on locomotor efference copies. The feasibility of such a feed-forward mechanism should however critically depend on the predictability of head movements (HMP) during locomotion. To test this, we studied in 10 healthy subjects the differential impact of a stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) on body sway (center-of-pressure, COP) during standing and walking at different speeds and compared it to activity-dependent changes in HMP. SVS-COP coupling was determined by correlation analysis in frequency and time domains. HMP was quantified as the proportion of head motion variance that can be explained by the average head trajectory across the locomotor cycle. SVS-COP coupling decreased from standing to walking and further dropped with faster locomotion. Correspondingly, HMP increased with faster locomotion. Furthermore, SVS-COP coupling depended on the gait-cycle-phase with peaks corresponding to periods of least HMP. These findings support the assumption that during stereotyped human self-motion, locomotor efference copies selectively replace vestibular cues, similar to what was previously observed in animal models."

  "date": "2020 Mar",
  "abstract": "Background: There is a growing interest concerning the understanding of the sagittal configuration of the cervical spine as a clinical outcome. However, evaluating sensorimotor control and autonomic nervous system for participants with forward head posture (FHP) compared to strictly matched control participants with normal head alignment has not been adequately addressed.\nMethods: Sensorimotor control variables include smooth pursuit neck torsion test(SPNT), Overall stability index (OSI) and left and right rotation repositioning accuracy. Autonomic nervous system function includes amplitude and latency of skin sympathetic response (SSR). We measured these variables in 80 participants with definite forward head posture (Craniovertebral angle less than 50 degrees) and 80 participants with age, gender, and BMI matched normal head alignment (Craniovertebral angle (CVA) more than 50 degrees). Differences in variable measures were examined using the parametric t-test. Pearson correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between FHP, sensorimotor control, and autonomic nervous system function.\nResults: The unpaired t-test analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences between the FHP group and control group for all of the sensorimotor measured variables including SPNT, OSI and left and right rotation repositioning accuracy (P < 0.001). Also, there was a significant difference in neurophysiological findings, including SSR amplitude (P = .005), but there was no significant difference for SSR Latency (P = .7). The CVA significantly correlated with all measured variables (P < 0.001).\nConclusions: Participants with FHP exhibited abnormal sensorimotor control and autonomic nervous system dysfunction compared to those with normal head alignment."

  "date": "2020 Jan 18",
  "abstract": "Background: Limitations in the lumbar spine movement reduce lumbar vertebral motion and affect spinopelvic kinematics. We studied the influence of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration on spinofemoral movement, from standing to sitting, in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA).\nMethods: Of 138 consecutive patients scheduled for THA due to unilateral avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head, those with ≥3 discs with University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) disc degeneration score > 1 were defined as the lumbar degenerative disc disease (LDD) group, and the remaining patients constituted d the control group. Full body anteroposterior and lateral EOS images in the standing and sitting positions were obtained. Pelvic incidence (PI), L1 slope (L1 s), lumbar lordosis angle (LL), pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), femoral slope (Fs), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), hip flexion, lumbar spine flexion, and total spinofemoral flexion were measured on the images and compared between groups.\nResults: No significant between-group differences were observed in the height, weight, body mass index, AVN staging, or PI, SS, and Fs on standing. The LDD group included more females and older patients, had 5° lesser LL, 5° greater PT, and larger SVA. From standing to sitting, the PI remained constant in both groups. Total spinofemoral flexion was 7° less, lumbar spine flexion 16° less, L1 slope change 6° less, and SS change 8° less, and hip flexion was 7° more in the LDD than in the control group. The spine/hip flexion ratio was significantly lower in the LDD group (0.3 versus 0.7; p < 0.001). On regression analysis, the LDD group (p < 0.001) and older age (p = 0.048) but not sex, weight, or height were significant univariate predictors of decreased spine/hip ratio.\nConclusions: Patients with LDD leant more forward and had a larger pelvis posterior tilt angle on standing and a decreased lumbar spine/hip flexion ratio, with more hip joint flexion, on sitting, to compensate for reduced lumbar spine flexion. Surgeons should be aware that elderly patients with multiple LDD have significantly different spinofemoral movements and increased risk of posterior dislocation post-THA. Preoperative patient identification, intraoperative surgical technique modification, and individualized rehabilitation protocols are necessary."

In addition, sonotubometry with postural change (Ohta's method), sitting CT and a newly devised PHI-10 score were also examined.\nResults: Voice autophony, aural fullness, and breathing autophony were observed in 93.6%, 87.2%, 78.2%, respectively. In 91% of the ears, PET symptoms improved by postural change from sitting to the lying / forward-bending position. Synchronous movement of the TM upon respiration was observed in 69.1% of the ears. Positive findings of TTAG were observed in 75.6% of ears. Positive findings of sonotubometry were found in 55.1% of ears. Sonotubometry with postural change (Ohta's method), when the cut-off value of over 10dB was used, was positive in 45.2% of ears. Newly devised PHI-10 score representing severity of subjective symptoms classifying patients into no handicap, mild handicap, moderate handicap and severe handicap were observed in 12.2%, 10.8%, 18.9% and 58.1% of ears, respectively. The evaluation of the extent of patency of the ET by sitting CT indicated completely open, closed-short, and closed-long, in 68.6%, 11.4% and 21.4% of ears, respectively. Compared to the closed group, the completely open group had a significantly higher frequency of positive breathing autophony, positive sonotubometry, and positive Ohta's method.\nConclusion: The characteristics of main symptoms and the efficiency of various tests in PET diagnosis were analyzed based on data obtained from \"Definite PET\" patients diagnosed by the JOS Diagnostic Criteria. The greater the availability of tests to evaluate PET, the greater the opportunities to diagnose \"Definite PET\". In particular, tests measuring pressure transmission between the nasopharynx and middle ear, such as TM observation and TTAG, are more sensitive than sonotubometry measuring sound transmission."

  "abstract": "[Purpose] To present the dramatic improvement of sagittal posture in a young male with Scheuermann's disease suffering from pain ailments as treated by Chiropractic BioPhysics® technique. [Participant and Methods] An 18 year old reported low back pain and headaches for several years. Full spine radiographic assessment revealed pronounced thoracic hyperkyphosis, anterior head translation, posterior thoracolumbar sagittal balance, and a reduced sacral base orientation. The patient was treated by Chiropractic BioPhysics methods incorporating mirror image® exercises, traction, as well as spinal manipulation. [Results] Assessment after 35 treatment sessions over 14-weeks revealed a dramatic improvement in postural parameters. The thoracic kyphosis reduced by 13°, and was accompanied by a reduction in forward head posture, reduction in posterior sagittal balance, and an increase in sacral base angle to normal. The low back pain and headaches were alleviated. [Conclusion] This case adds to the accumulating evidence demonstrating CBP methods offers an effective approach to reduce the burden of postural disorders including those with Scheuermann's disease. Since thoracic hyperkyphosis is a serious disorder, the routine comprehensive assessment via full-spine radiography is essential for the quantification of relevant postural parameters."

  "abstract": "The present study examined the kinematics and biomechanical parameters of the head of a person thrown forward by the judo technique 'Seoi-nage'. A judo expert threw an anthropomorphic test device (the POLAR dummy) five times. Kinematics data were obtained with a high-speed digital video camera. Linear and angular accelerations of the head were measured by accelerometers mounted at the center of gravity of the dummy's head. When Seoi-nage was performed, the dummy fell forward accompanied by contacting the anterior parietal regions of the head to the tatami, and the linear and angular accelerations of most axes reached peak values when the head contacted the tatami. Peak resultant linear and angular accelerations were 20.3 ± 9.8 G and 1890.1 ± 1151.9 rad/s2, respectively (means ± standard deviation). Peak values in linear and angular acceleration did not significantly differ between the three directional axes. Absolute angular accelerations in all axes observed in Seoi-nage were high and the resultant value was approximately equal to the already reported in Ouchi-gari, one of the predominant techniques causing judo-related acute subdural hematoma. However, the remarkable increase of linear acceleration in the longitudinal direction and/or angular acceleration in the sagittal plane, as previously reported in techniques being thrown backward (i.e., Ouchi-gari and Osoto-gari), was not detected. The likely mechanism of acute subdural hematoma caused by Seoi-nage is that a large angular acceleration causes large strains and deformations of the brain surface and subsequent rupture of cortical vessels."

  "date": "2019 Dec 19.",
  "abstract": "There have been increasing cases of people seeking treatment for neck and back pain. The most common cause of neck and back pain is due to long-term poor sitting posture. The most common poor sitting posture cases are humpback, and head and neck being too far forward. It is easy to cause neck and back pain and other symptoms. Therefore, the development of wearable posture monitoring system for dynamic assessment of sitting posture becomes both helpful and necessary. In addition to recording the wearer's posture when sitting with quantitative assessment, it is needed to execute real-time action feedback for correctness of posture, in order to reduce neck and back pain due to long-term poor sitting posture. This study completed an instant recording and dynamic assessment of position measurement and feedback system. The system consists of a number of dynamic measurement units that can describe the posture trajectory, which integrates three-axis gyro meter, three-axis accelerometer, and magnetometer in order to measure the dynamic tracking. In the reliability analysis experiment, angle measurement error is less than 2%. The correlation coefficient between correlation analysis and Motion Analysis (MA) is 0.97. It is shown that the motion trajectory of this system is highly correlated with MA. In the feasibility test of sitting position detection, it is possible to detect the sitting position from the basic action of the walking, standing, sitting and lying down, and the sensitivity reaches 95.84%. In the assessment of the sitting position, the information published by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety was used, as well as the recommendations of professional physicians as a basis for evaluating the threshold of the sitting measurement parameters and immediately feedback to the subjects. The system developed in this study can be helpful to reduce neck and back pain due to long-term poor sitting posture."

  "title": "Body Inversion Effects With Photographic Images of Body Postures: Is It About Faces?",
  "date": "2019 Nov 29",
  "abstract": "As with faces, participants are better at discriminating upright bodies than inverted bodies. This inversion effect is reliable for whole figures, namely, bodies with heads, but it is less reliable for headless bodies. This suggests that removal of the head disrupts typical processing of human figures, and raises questions about the role of faces in efficient body discrimination. In most studies, faces are occluded, but the aim here was to exclude faces in a more ecologically valid way by presenting photographic images of human figures from behind (about-facing), as well as measuring gaze to different parts of the figures. Participants determined whether pairs of sequentially presented body postures were the same or different for whole and headless figures. Presenting about-facing figures (heads seen from behind) and forward-facing figures with faces enabled a comparison of the effect of the presence or absence of faces. Replicating previous findings, there were inversion effects for forward-facing whole figures, but less reliable effects for headless images. There were also inversion effects for about-facing whole figures, but not about-facing headless figures. Accuracy was higher in the forward- compared to the about-facing conditions, but proportional dwell time was greater to bodies in about-facing images. Likewise, despite better discrimination of forward-facing upright compared to inverted whole figures, participants focused more on the heads and less on the bodies in upright compared to inverted images. However, there was no clear relationship between performance and dwell time proportions to heads. Body inversion effects (BIEs) were found with about-facing whole figures and headless forward-facing figures, despite the absence of faces. With inverted whole figures, there was a significant relationship between performance and greater looking at bodies, and less at heads suggesting that in more difficult conditions a focus on bodies is associated with better discrimination. Overall, the findings suggest that the visual system has greater sensitivity to bodies in their most experienced form, which is typically upright and with a head. Otherwise, the more a face is implied by the context, as in whole figures or forward- rather than about-facing headless bodies, the better the performance as holistic/configural processing is likely stronger."

  "date": "2019 Dec 12",
  "abstract": "Background: Although the postural instability accompanying bilateral vestibular loss in human and quadrupeds during lateral head movements are well-known, it is still unclear whether or not lateral head turns would indeed activate the postural control system to maintain balance. This study aimed to examine the kinetic parameters in freely standing intact cats during head movements in order to further answer the above question.\nMethods: Six intact cats were trained to stand, unrestrained on a force plate and perform voluntary head movements to the left and right positions in response to visual cues. Each trial was divided into two phases, quiet standing with the cat's head maintaining a straight forward and lateral head position after voluntary head movements. Kinetic parameters including peak pressure and contact area under each limb as well as center of pressure (COP) displacements of the whole body were measured.\nResults: Compared to the neutral head position, peak pressure and contact area of the left head position were significantly smaller for the left forelimb while greatly larger for the right forelimb. An exact opposite case of peak pressure and contact area in the forelimbs was found between the right and neutral head positions. In addition, the COP displacements altered oppositely to the head movements, and presented a significantly right shift in the left position and a significantly left shift in the right position.\nConclusion: These results demonstrate that the lateral displacement of the head in standing intact cats does activate the postural adjustment to maintain balance, which is consistent with the concept that vestibular input can contribute to postural balance during voluntary head turns."

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Tension-type headache (TTH) decreases the ability to concentrate and function during daily activities in affected patients. As most patients with TTH exhibit forward head posture (FHP). Various interventions have been proposed to resolve TTH. However, research regarding the efficacy of these interventions remains lacking. The present study aimed to investigate the association between FHP and TTH, and to evaluate the efficacy of various intervention methods on headache symptoms and other clinical variables in patients with TTH induced by FHP. MATERIAL AND METHODS Participants were randomly allocated to 3 groups: biofeedback (BF, n₁=21), manual therapy (MT, n₂=20) and, stretching (ST, n₃=21). Interventions were conducted 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Craniovertebral angle (CVA), electroencephalographic findings for attention, stress, and pressure-pain threshold (PPT), headache on activities of daily living (Henry Ford Headache Disability Inventory, HDI), and quality of life (QoL) assessments were obtained pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at the 2-week follow-up. RESULTS The correlation between CVA and HDI after intervention (R²=0.324, P<0.001), and at 2-week follow-up (R²=0.115, P<0.01) are significant. BF was associated with significant improvements in CVA (F₂,₅₉=3.393, P<0.001, η^2/P=0.130), attention (F₂,₅₉=5.186, P<0.01, η^2/P=0.150), stress [skin temperature (F₂,₅₉=6.005, P<0.001, η^2/P=0.169) and skin conductance (F₂,₅₉=4.900, P<0.01, η^2/P=0.142)], PPT (F₂,₅₉=5.050, P<0.01, η^2/P=0.146), HDI (F₂,₅₉=3.303, P<0.01, η^2/P=0.101), and QoL (F₂,₅₉=3.409, P<0.05, η^2/P=0.104). CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that BF was more effective than MT and ST in the treatment of TTH due to FHP. Such findings highlight the need to develop and promote a controlled exercise program to facilitate a return to normal daily activities in patients with TTH due to FHP."

  "title": "Playing-Related Injuries and Posture Among Saxophonists",
  "date": "2019 Dec",
  "abstract": "Aims: Playing-related injuries are common among musicians, but little is known about the nature of injuries and complaints in saxophone players. This research explored playing-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) and postures among saxophonists. The aims were to: 1) investigate the prevalence of PRMDs among saxophonists; 2) determine the most problematic body parts; and 3) identify their main postural habits and determine whether these postural habits may be related to the prevalence of pain in specific body parts.\nMethods: An online questionnaire was used to collect data from professional and college-level saxophonists throughout North America.\nResults: From 109 saxophonists who responded, 83 (76.15%) reported ever having a PRMD, 54 (50%) reported having a PRMD in the past year, 30 (27.52%) reported having a PRMD in the past month, and 23 (21.10%) reported having a PRMD in the past week. Top rated areas of pain were the right wrist, neck, mouth/jaw, and left wrist. The most common self-reported postural habits were forward head position and rounded upper back. Postures that correlated with higher pain ratings were rounded upper back and backward pelvic tilt. The rounded upper back, backward pelvic tilt, and excessive curve in low back postures were significantly correlated with the presence of PRMD problems in the right wrist.\nConclusions: Saxophonists in this survey experienced a high prevalence of PRMDs, especially of the wrists, neck, and mouth/jaw. Certain postural habits may contribute to higher pain ratings or PRMD locations within saxophonists."

  "title": "The Relationship Between Forward Head Posture and Neck Pain: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "date": "2019 Dec",
  "abstract": "Purpose of review: Forward head posture (FHP) is the most common cervical postural fault in the sagittal plane that is found with different severity levels in almost all populations. Despite claims that FHP may be related to neck pain, this relation seems to be controversial. Thus, our purpose is to determine whether FHP differs between asymptomatic subjects and those with neck pain and to investigate if there is a relationship between head posture and neck pain.\nRecent findings: A total of 15 cross-sectional studies were eligible for inclusion for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Ten studies compared FHP between a group of asymptomatic participants and a group of participants with neck pain and an overall mean difference (MD) of 4.84 (95% CI = 0.14, 9.54), indicating a significant between-group difference, contrary to adolescent (MD = - 1.05; 95% CI = - 4.23, 2.12). Eight studies showed significant negative correlations between FHP and neck pain intensity (r = - 0.55; 95% CI = - 0.69, - 0.36) as well as disability (r = - 0.42; 95% CI = - 0.54, - 0.28) in adults and older adults, while in adolescents, only lifetime prevalence and doctor visits due to neck pain were significant predictors for FHP. This systematic review found that age played an important role as a confounding factor in the relation between FHP and neck pain. Also, the results showed that adults with neck pain show increased FHP when compared to asymptomatic adults and that FHP is significantly correlated with neck pain measures in adults and older adults. No association was found between FHP and most of neck pain measures in adolescents."

  "title": "Surgeon's Neck Posture during Spine Surgeries: \"The Unrecognised Potential Occupational Hazard\"",
  "date": "2019 Nov-Dec",
  "abstract": "Study design: Observational study.\nPurpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the surgeon's neck postures while performing lumbar spinal surgeries.\nOverview of literature: Lumbar spinal surgeries are on rising trend, and with increase in number of procedures, the average time spent by a spine surgeon performing surgical procedures is also increasing. The effect of operating posture on the surgeon's neck is largely unknown. From the studies conducted on usage of smartphones, abnormal neck postures, especially the forward head posture (FHP), were found to adversely affect the cervical spine of individuals. The present study analyzes the neck position of spine surgeons during lumbar spine surgeries.\nMethodology: Sixty video recordings (25 open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions [TLIFs] and 35 lumbar decompression [LD] procedures - 15 with headlight and 20 with operating microscope) of surgeries performed by three spine surgeons of different heights were analyzed. Running videos of the surgeries were recorded concentrating on the surgeons with reflective markers taped to their surface landmarks corresponding to C7 spinous process, tragus of the ear, and outer canthus of the eye. Video recordings were standardized by a fixed video recorder in the same operating theater. Snapshots from the video were obtained whenever the surgeon changes the position. Head flexion angle (HFA), neck flexion angle (NFA), and cervical angle (CA) were measured and analyzed.\nResults: During TLIF, HFA and NFA were significantly higher during the phases of decompression and fusion (P < 0.05). The average CA of all surgeons was lower, thereby adversely affecting the cervical spine (20.15° ± 5.05°). During LD, CA showed significant difference between usage of microscope and headlight (P < 0.001).\nConclusion: Surgeon's FHP is frequently caused by a compromise between the need to perform surgery with hands, without elevating the arms, and simultaneous control of gaze at surgical field. The usage of microscope was found to reduce the stress on neck while performing surgery."

  "date": "2020 Apr",
  "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the effect of therapeutic exercise (TE) on pain, disability, posture, and health status in female dentists suffering from chronic neck pain (NP).\nMethods: 48 female dentists (40-45 years) suffering from NP were randomly divided into two experimental (n = 24) and control (n = 24) groups. Experimental group received 8 weeks of TE aimed to improve (1) muscle coordination and proprioception, (2) muscular endurance, and (3) muscle strength. Control group received no specific exercises. The pain, disability, posture (forward head and protracted shoulder angles), and health status were assessed at baseline and after an 8-week TE by visual analogue scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), photogrammetry, and self-rated general health questionnaire, respectively. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis.\nResults: There were significant between-group differences in neck pain [p = 0.003, 0.86 (0.09-1.65)], disability [p = 0.009, ES (95% CI) = 0.78 (0.020-1.37)], forward head angle [p = 0.039, ES (95% CI) = 0.61 (0.034-1.19)], protracted shoulder angle [p = 0.031, ES (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.062-1.22)], and health status [p = 0.022, ES (95% CI) = 0.68 (0.102-1.26)] favoring the corrective exercise group. There were significant within-group changes in pain, disability, posture, and health status in the experimental group. However, there were no within group changes in the control group.\nConclusions: TEs successfully alleviated pain, disability, posture, and health status in female dentists suffering from chronic NP. Considering the extremely large effect size of TEs, this intervention was recommended to neck pain treatment in patients suffering from chronic NP, poor posture, and health problem."

Previously reported suicidal gunshot wounds to the nose have been through the left nostril (Forensic Sci Int 1995;71(1):25-31; J Forensic Radiol Imag 2013;1(2):63-7). The death of a 26-year-old man with a close-range gunshot wound to the bridge of the nose was deemed suicide due to history, scene, and autopsy findings. These findings included previous suicidal ideation, texted and written notes, the decedent's cross-legged position seated on the floor, the trajectory of the bullet through his head and into the ceiling fan and roof above him, and acute alcohol intoxication. This decedent may have been intending a hard contact forehead location but inadvertently fired the gun into the bridge of his nose while bending forward, prior to contact."

  "abstract": "Background: Cochlear implantation is an important method of hearing rehabilitation. Earlier studies have shown the influence of implantation on the vestibular system. However, until now, the effect of hearing rehabilitation with cochlear implants (CI) on postural control and body stability has not been sufficiently studied.\nObjective: To analyse the effect of hearing rehabilitation with activated CI and different sound inputs (music, speech text, and white noise) on postural control and risk of falls after implantation.\nMethods: This was a prospective clinical trial that included 33 adult patients with at least 6 months' use of a CI (mean time after implantation = 23 months). All patients underwent a standard or geriatric (for patients >60 years) balancing deficit test protocol with a mobile posturography system (VertiGuard®) in different situations (CI deactivated/activated and different sound inputs). As the main outcome measure, the risk of falls (%) after each protocol was calculated by evaluating body sway both forward to backward and side to side (°/s).\nResults: With the CI deactivated, the mean risk of falls was 45.5%. After activation of the CI, there was a small decrease in the mean risk of falls, but it was statistically significant. With an additional sound input (music or speech text) this decrease was more pronounced: 42.0 and 42.4%, respectively. This effect seems to be more pronounced in older patients. Regarding the individual patients, 72% had an improvement in the risk of falls with an activated CI, and 28% had a slight deterioration. An activated CI accompanied by sound input (music) further improved the individual risk of falls.\nConclusions: Compared with prior research, this study found that the risk of falls after implantation decreased over a longer time period. Furthermore, the use of a CI and different sound inputs had a positive effect on postural control. These findings support the need for optimal hearing rehabilitation, especially in elderly patients. Although this effect is relatively small, it is important to consider for further studies that rehabilitation with CI may reduce the risk of falls. While the auditory system supposedly contributes to postural control only to a small degree and the mechanism is still poorly understood, further studies with bigger samples are warranted to clarify these effects."

  "abstract": "Background: Hyperkyphosis is often accompanied by forward head and shoulder postures. Together, these three disorders are called \"Upper Cross Syndrome (UCS)\". We aimed to perform a photogrammetric analysis of UCS among teachers and to determine the effects of National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) exercises with ergonomic training interventions on the syndrome.\nStudy design: A semi-experimental study.\nMethods: Photogrammetric analysis was performed using the UCS software among teachers in order to determine the angles of forward head, rounded shoulders, and hyperkyphosis. Twenty-three teachers were selected purposefully and enrolled in Fasa City in 2018. They were randomly divided into experimental (n=12) and control (n=11) groups. Experimental group attended 12 wk of NASM exercises with ergonomic intervention but the control group did not participate in any regular exercise. The data were analyzed using paired t-test and differential independent t-test (P<0.05).\nResults: The results indicated a significant decrease in forward head (P=0.001), shoulder angles (P=0.000) and hyperkyphosis (P=0.003). The applied intervention had a 90% positive effect in reducing the forward head angle, an 88% positive effect in reducing the rounded shoulder angle and a 90% positive effect in reducing the kyphosis angle. However, the results for the control group did not show a significant difference for forward head, rounded shoulders, and hyperkyphosis angles.\nConclusion: The UCS software application can be used as an accurate instrument for measuring the extent of the UCS. Moreover, using NASM exercises can lead to a reduction in the UCS among teachers."

  "date": "2019",
  "abstract": "Objective: Child occupant behavior and head position when travelling in child restraint systems (CRS) may have an effect on injury risk in the event of a motor vehicle crash. The current study aimed to describe the common characteristics and behaviors of child occupants during everyday, real-world motor vehicle travel in a sample of Australian families to identify potential safety implications of observed behaviors and head position within the CRS. Methods: Two instrumented study vehicles were used by 42 families for approximately two weeks. Continuous video and audio data were collected across 1,651 trips (over 600 hours). An online survey provided additional parent, familial and child occupant data. The characteristics and behaviors of 72 child occupants (aged 14 months to 9 years) who travelled in a forward-facing CRS (FFCRS) or a belt-positioning booster seat (BS) were observed and recorded by manual review of a sample of the video/audio recordings. One quarter of all trips (n = 414) was randomly selected for coding/analysis and, within each trip, one child occupant was selected who was travelling in a FFCRS or BS. Child occupant behaviors, head position within the FFCRS or BS, and other relevant information was coded for each trip during nine discrete five second intervals or 'epochs' (5%, 17%, 25%, 30%, 50%, 53%, 75%, 89% and 95% of trip duration). Results: In the majority of epochs (74%), child occupants' heads were observed to be 'optimally' positioned within the FFCRS or BS. For more than half of the epochs, child occupants were observed to be: correctly restrained (58%) and involved in an interaction with another vehicle occupant (59%). Bivariate analyses revealed that children travelling in a FFCRS were significantly more likely to be observed to have optimal head positions than those travelling in a BS (78% vs. 62%), χ2 (1) = 86.00, p < 0.001. Child occupants who were observed to be 'correctly' restrained were significantly more likely to be observed to have optimal head positions than those who were observed to be 'incorrectly' restrained (80% vs. 20%), χ2 (1) = 10.33, p < 0.01. Conclusions: This is the first naturalistic driving study (NDS) to specifically explore the factors associated with child occupants' head position when travelling in a CRS. Findings from the current study can be used to inform the positioning of anthropometric test dummies (ATD) in CRS testing, guide improvements to CRS/vehicle design, and develop targeted educational strategies to improve child occupant safety."

  "title": "A computational fluid dynamics simulation of liquid swallowing by impaired pharyngeal motion: bolus pathway and pharyngeal residue",
  "date": "2019 Dec 1",
  "abstract": "Common practices to improve the ability to swallow include modifying physical properties of foods and changing the posture of patients. Here, we quantified the effects of the viscosity of a liquid bolus and patient posture on the bolus pathway and pharyngeal residue using a computational fluid dynamics simulation. We developed a computational model of an impaired pharyngeal motion with a low pharyngeal pressure and no pharyngeal adaptation. We varied viscosities from 0.002 to 1 Pa·s and postures from -15° to 30° (from nearly vertical to forward leaning). In the absence of pharyngeal adaptation, a honey-like liquid bolus caused pharyngeal residue, particularly in the case of forward-leaning postures. Although the bolus speed was different among viscosities, the final pathway was only slightly different. The shape, location, and tilting of the epiglottis effectively invited a bolus to two lateral pathways, suggesting a high robustness of the swallowing process.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Thickening agents are often used for patients with dysphagia. An increase in bolus viscosity not only reduces the risk of aspiration but also can cause a residual volume in the pharynx. Because information obtained from videofluoroscopic swallowing studies is only two-dimensional, measurement of pharyngeal residue is experimentally difficult. We successfully quantified the three-dimensional bolus pathway and the pharyngeal residual volume using computational modeling and simulation."

  "abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effects of indirect vision skills on head and shoulder posture in dental hygienists.\nMaterials and methods: This cross-sectional study included a total of 100 female clinical dental hygienists. It evaluated musculoskeletal symptoms of the neck, shoulders and back, head and shoulder posture (craniovertebral angle [CVA] and sagittal shoulder posture angle [SSPA]). Indirect vision skills were assessed using the O'Connor tweezer test under indirect vision with a mirror. To analyse factors associated with the CVA and SSPA, an independent t test, one-way ANOVA, and multiple linear regression analysis were conducted, respectively.\nResults: The body region in which the greatest number of symptoms of work-related musculoskeletal disorders was recognised was the neck (89.0%). In the multiple linear regression model, which adjusted for other factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders, dental hygienists with poor indirect vision skills showed relatively small SSPA value (P < .05). However, indirect vision skills were not associated with the CVA value.\nConclusions: Good indirect vision skills contribute to the prevention of rounded shoulders in dental hygienists. Therefore, where possible, dental hygienists should perform clinical procedures using indirect vision with a dental mirror to maintain a balanced posture and reduce flexion of the back or the neck. A dental hygiene curriculum should include training to improve clinical skills, as well as education regarding dental ergonomics and a monitoring system to determine whether ergonomic principles are well observed."

Semi-professional and professional players had the highest injury rates. The most common posture deviations were having a forward shoulder position (46.9%), a forward head position (33.3%), a varus knee interspace (32.9%) or a lumbar lordosis (30.9%). A moderate C-scoliosis deviation was associated with a decrease in injury risk (OR 1.57 95% CI 1.00-2.46 p = 0.052). Included in the model was player weight, which was associated with an increased risk of injury (OR 1.04 95% CI 1.01-1.07 p = 0.010).\nConclusions: Although postural deviations are common in rugby league players, given the lack of association with injury, they may not warrant intervention."

The link between risk factors for UE musculoskeletal injuries and baseball athletes' perceived UE function and pain, as measured by the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic (KJOC) questionnaire, is unclear.\nObjective: To (1) describe the musculoskeletal characteristics of the UE (posture, range of motion, flexibility, and isometric strength) in a population of baseball athletes and (2) determine the predictive capability of UE musculoskeletal characteristics for the KJOC score in these athletes.\nDesign: Cohort study.\nSetting: Athletic training room.\nPatients or other participants: A total of 37 male National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I baseball athletes (age = 20.10 ± 1.27 years, height = 186.96 ± 7.64 cm, mass = 90.60 ± 10.69 kg).\nIntervention(s): Athletes self-reported all shoulder musculoskeletal injuries and completed the KJOC questionnaire. Postural assessment consisted of forward head and shoulder posture. Flexibility tests characterized glenohumeral internal and external rotation, posterior shoulder tightness, and pectoralis minor length. Strength tests involved the lower and middle trapezius, rhomboid, glenohumeral internal and external rotation, pectoralis major, serratus anterior, supraspinatus, and upper trapezius.\nMain outcome measure(s): All 10 KJOC questions were summed for an overall score out of 100. Questions 1 through 5 were summed for a pain score; questions 6 through 10 were summed for a function score. All data were assessed for normality. A stepwise multiple regression model was fit to determine if the predictor variables assessed could predict the KJOC score. We set the α level a priori at .05.\nResults: For the KJOC total score, a 1-year history of shoulder injury accounted for 7.80% of the variance in the KJOC total score (P = .07). For KJOC questions 1 through 5, a history of UE injury in the year before testing and posterior shoulder tightness accounted for 14.40% of the variance in the KJOC total score (P = .047).\nConclusions: The link between a history of UE musculoskeletal injuries and the KJOC score highlights the need for continued focus on self-perceived pain and function after UE musculoskeletal injury."

This study determined the correlation among smartphone addiction level, craniovertebral angle, scapular dyskinesis, and selected anthropometric variables in physiotherapy undergraduates.\nMethods: Seventy-seven participants were recruited from the Department of Physiotherapy, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, through a purposive sampling technique. The smartphone addiction level was assessed with the short version Smartphone Addiction Scale (English version). Craniovertebral and scapular dyskinesis were assessed using the photographic method. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data at an alpha level of 0.05.\nResults: The analysis in this study revealed that many undergraduates are addicted to using smartphones. There was no significant difference in the addiction level (p = 0.367) and in scapular dyskinesis (p = 0.129) between male and female participants. However, there was a significant difference in craniovertebral angle (p = 0.032) between male and female participants. There was a significant relationship among smartphone addiction, craniovertebral angle (r = 0.306, p = 0.007), and scapular dyskinesis (r = 0.363, p = 0.007) in male and female participants.\nConclusion: A high level of smartphone addiction reduces the craniovertebral angle and increases scapular dyskinesis. Therefore, the smartphone addiction level should be assessed in all patients with neck and shoulder pain to plan appropriate management."

  "title": "Sleeping Unsafely Tucked in to Conserve Energy in a Nocturnal Migratory Songbird",
  "date": "2019 Aug 19",
  "abstract": "Each spring and fall, millions of normally diurnal birds switch to migrating at night. Most of these are small songbirds (passerine) migrating long distances that need to alternate their migratory flights with refueling stopovers [1, 2], which can account for up to 80% of the total migratory period [3]. After a long nocturnal flight, these birds face the contrasting needs to recover sleep and refill depleted energy stores, all while vulnerable to predation [4, 5]. Here, we investigated how garden warblers at a Mediterranean stopover site modulate their sleep behavior in relation to their metabolic state. At night, garden warblers in poor metabolic condition sleep more and exhibit less migratory restlessness than birds in good condition do. In addition, rather than sleeping with their head facing forward, birds in poor condition prefer to sleep with their head turned and tucked in their feathers. We further show that sleep with the head tucked is associated with lower respiratory and metabolic rates and reduced heat loss mediated by hiding the head-the body part with the highest heat dissipation-under the feathers. However, the benefit of conserving energy while sleeping with the head tucked was countered by reduced anti-predator vigilance. Birds presented with a sound simulating the approach of a predator responded more slowly when the head was tucked than when it was untucked. Consequently, our study demonstrates that through changing their sleep position and intensity, migrating songbirds can negotiate a previously unknown trade-off between sleep-mediated energy conservation and anti-predatory vigilance."

Participants were able to take part for one one-hour session.\nIntervention: Reaching while sitting in four seating conditions (FW or horizontal seat; with or without foot-support) applied in randomized order.\nOutcome measures: Simultaneously, surface electromyography (EMG) of neck, trunk and arm muscles and kinematics of head and reaching arm (step one of two-step-project) were recorded. Primary outcome parameters were the ability to modulate EMG-amplitudes at baseline and during reaching (phasic muscle activity). Other EMG-parameters were direction-specificity (1st control level), and 2nd level of control parameters: recruitment order, and anticipatory postural activity. Motor behaviour measures: ability to modulate EMG-amplitudes to kinematic characteristics of reaching and head stability.\nResults: Only foot-support was associated with increased tonic background EMG-amplitudes and decreased phasic EMG-amplitudes of the trunk extensors in children with US-CP and BS-CP (mixed-models analyses; p-values <0.01). The foot-support effect was also associated with better kinematics of reaching (Spearman's Rho; p-values <0.01).\nConclusion: In terms of postural adjustments during forward reaching, foot-support enhanced the children's capacity to modulate trunk extensor activity, which was associated with improved reaching quality.

Patients in the OMTh group underwent a 3-month period of OMTh, and patients in the control group were treated with amitriptyline. Pain intensity, frequency, and duration of headaches, as well as FHP were analyzed.\nResults: The study enrolled 10 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.6 [15.2] years) in the OMTh group and 10 patients (51.4 [17.3] years) in the control group. The final assessment of OMTh patients showed statistically significant changes in all headache parameters: pain intensity decreased from a mean (SD) score of 4.9 (1.4) to 3.1 (1.1) (P=.002); frequency decreased from 19.8 (6) to 8.3 (6.2) days per month (P=.002); and the duration of headaches decreased from 10 (4.2) to 6 (3) hours (P=.01). Significant improvement of all parameters was found in the control group as well: pain intensity decreased from a mean (SD) score of 5.9 (0.7) to 4.2 (1.75) (P=.03); frequency decreased from 23.4 (7.2) to 7.4 (8.7) days per month (P=.003); and duration decreased from 7.8 (2.9) to 3.6 (2.1) hours (P=.002). Forward head posture significantly improved in OMTh patients (P=.003).\nConclusions: Our data suggested that OMTh may be an effective treatment to improve headaches in patients with CTTH. Our results also suggest that OMTh may reduce FHP."

  "date": "2019 Jul-Sep",
  "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of thoracolumbar myofascial release to increase the resistance of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle bilaterally and to decrease the angle of forward head posture in young women enrolled at the Autónoma University of Chile.\nMaterial and methods: This longitudinal study was based on the immediate measurement (5minutes) of muscular resistance (seconds) through the fatigue test by means of surface electromyography in the bilateral sternocleidomastoid and analysis of the angle of forward head posture after the application of thoracolumbar myofascial release (TMFR). The 35 women evaluated met the inclusion criteria of female sex, age between 22 and 27 years, sedentary lifestyle, senior students of the Autónoma University of Chile, forward angle head posture between 43.8 and 51 degrees, body mass index indicating normal weight or overweight, and without spinal abnormalities. All participants provided written informed consent.\nResults: After the application of TMFR, there were statistically significant and immediate changes in the muscular resistance of the sternocleidomastoid with an average increase of 27.4seconds (P<.05) and an average decrease in the forward head posture angle of 2.8 degrees (P<.05).\nConclusion: TMFR produces an immediate effect in increasing the muscular resistance of the bilateral sternocleidomastoid and reducing the forward head posture angle in young women with forward head posture."

  "date": "2019 Nov",
  "abstract": "One of the most appealing hypotheses around the aetiopathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis attributes the development of the spine deformity to an imbalance in the descending vestibulospinal drive to the muscles resulting in a differential mechanical pull on the spine during the early life stages. In this study, we explored this hypothesis by examining postural and muscle responses to binaural bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) of randomly alternating polarity. Adolescents diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis (n = 12) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 12) stood quietly with feet together (stance duration 66-102 s), eyes closed and facing forward, while 10 short (2s), transmastoidal, bipolar square wave GVS pulses (0.3-2.0 mA) of randomly alternating polarity were delivered at varying time intervals. Responses depicted in the electromyographic (EMG) activity of bilateral axial and appendicular muscles, vertical reaction forces and segment kinematics were recorded and analysed. Scoliotic patients demonstrated smaller ankle muscle responses and a delayed postural shift to the right relative to controls during anode right/cathode left GVS. When GVS polarity was reversed, patients had a greater soleus short-latency response on the left anodal side, while the rest of the muscle and postural responses were similar between groups. Vestibular stimulation also evoked greater head and upper trunk sway in scoliotic compared with healthy adolescents irrespective of stimulus polarity. Results provide new preliminary evidence for a vestibular imbalance in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis that is compensated by somatosensory, load-related afferent feedback from the lower limbs during the latter part of the response."

  "abstract": "[Purpose] Stand-and-ride personal mobility devices controlled by movements of the user's center of gravity are used for balance training. We aimed to describe the physical activity required to operate this type of mobility device. [Participants and Methods] Eleven healthy males performed the following tasks: 1) moving their center of gravity forward or backward while standing on the floor (control task) and, 2) moving the mobility device forward or backward by moving their center of gravity (experimental task). [Results] We observed that the displacement of the center of gravity and the center of pressure, as well as angular displacements of the hips and knee joints, and maximum muscle activities of the biceps femoris, the medial head of the gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles were lesser during the experimental than during the control task. The distance moved by the device was significantly greater than the displacement of the user's center of gravity during the experimental task. [Conclusion] We observed that moving the device forward or backward required lesser physical activity than that required to shift the user's center of gravity forward or backward while standing on the floor. Additionally, we observed that even a small displacement of the user's center of gravity produced a large displacement of the device. We concluded that during balance training, the greater and more easily perceived movement of the mobility device would provide helpful feedback to the user."

  "abstract": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease which effects cervical posture of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate AS patients according to the degree of cervical disorder and was evaluate them electrophysiologically, functionality, and disease parameters. Our study comprised 64 AS patients and 30 healthy controls. The head posture of patients was evaluated by craniovertebral angle (CVA) measurement. Nerve conduction of bilateral median, radial, ulnar, and medial antebrachial cutaneous (MAC) nerves were studied in all patients. The most important nerve conduction differences in AS patients who have severe forward head posture (FHP) were decrease in sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude and compound muscle action potential amplitudes of median nerves, a decrease in the SNAP amplitude of ulnar nerves, a delay in the F response latency of ulnar nerves, and prolongation in the SNAP latency of the MAC nerve. The FHP disorder that develops in AS patients may have electro physiological effects, similar to those of thoracic outlet syndrome In addition, the functional status of these patients is worsened as severity of FHP increases."

  "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to explore whether vertebral fracture characteristics or posture is independently associated with physical performance. Posture was significantly associated with physical performance but fracture characteristics were not, suggesting posture should be the focus of physical performance variance.\nPurpose: The main objective of this study was to explore whether vertebral fracture characteristics (number, severity, location) or occiput-to-wall distance (OWD) is independently associated with physical performance.\nMethods: This was a secondary data analysis using baseline data from a randomized controlled trial, of community-dwelling women aged 65 years and older with a suspected vertebral fragility fracture. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were used to determine the number, location, and severity of fracture. The dependent variables were timed up and go (TUG), five times sit-to-stand, four-meter walk, and step test. The independent variables were number, severity, location of fracture, and OWD. Pain during movement and age were covariates. Multivariable regression analyses determined the association between each of the dependent and independent variables.\nResults: Participants' (n = 158) mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 75.9 (6.5) years. They had a mean (SD) BMI, OWD, and number of fractures of 26.7 (5.3) kg/m2, 5.7 (4.6) cm, and 2.2 (1.8), respectively. OWD was independently associated with TUG (estimated coefficient [B] = 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16, 0.42), five times sit-to-stand (B = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12, 0.55), four-meter walk (B = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.13), and step test (B = - 0.36, 95% CI = - 0.50, - 0.23) in the unadjusted model. OWD was independently associated with TUG (B = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.12, 0.38), five times sit-to-stand (B = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.07, 0.50), four-meter walk (B = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.12), and step test (B = - 0.22, 95% CI = - 0.47, - 0.19) in the adjusted model.\nConclusion: OWD was significantly associated with physical performance but fracture characteristics were not. These analyses were exploratory and require replication in future studies."

  "title": "[Long term postural myopic shift assessment after posterior iris-claw aphakic intraocular lens implantation]",
  "date": "2019 Nov",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Posterior chamber iris-claw intraocular lens (IOL) is often used in aphakic eyes with inadequate capsular support. Postoperatively, patients may describe better capabilities for near reading in a face-down position. The goal was to evaluate the indications, visual outcomes and complications of this IOL and to compare postoperative spherical equivalent between the prone and the face-down position.\nMaterials and methods: Retrospective single-center case series of 31 eyes of 28 patients who underwent surgery between 2007 and 2016. Visual outcomes, early and late complications were analyzed. The refractive measurements were also assessed using a portable refractometer in prone and face-down position for each patient. The spherical equivalents were then compared.\nResults: The mean follow up was 29 months (3-73). The final mean corrected visual acuity (0.17±0.5 SD LogMar) was significantly better than preoperatively (0.5±0.50 SD LogMar) (P<0.05). Postoperative refractive error was within±2 diopters of emmetropia in 95 % of patients. The mean spherical equivalents in prone and face down position were different (P<0.05),-0.44 diopters (-4;+2.75) and-1.38 diopters (-5.25; 1) respectively. A mean myopic shift of-0.95 diopters (-5.25; 1.00) was observed in face down position. Cystoïd macular edema (6 %) and IOL disenclavation (9.6 %) were the main complications.\nDiscussion: A posterior iris-claw intraocular lens appears to be an effective and relatively safe IOL to treat aphakia with poor capsular support. When the patient's head is bent forward, a mean myopic shift of 1 diopter is observed. This may support the idea that this IOL could be considered as an accommodative implant. Anterior movement of the iris-IOL complex due to gravity may be responsible for this myopic shift."

  "date": "2020 Feb",
  "abstract": "Purpose: The ageing process can be accompanied by a degeneration of the spine and increase the risk of thoracic hyperkyphosis (excessive spinal forward curvature) amongst elderly people. This condition can in turn impair mobility, reduce balance, and increase the risk of falling and mortality in affected individuals. The use of corrective orthotic bracing has been shown to improve spinal posture, and increase stability and balance amongst the elderly. However, there is little evidence that evaluates the use of corrective braces on foot pressure changes in these subjects.Methods: In this study, we evaluated the use of a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) on 19 subjects over 60 years old who presented with hyperkyphosis. We measured foot pressure using the Pedar-X system before (without brace) and after (with brace) immediate using a TLSO in both static (quite standing) and dynamic (walking on a 5 meters freeway) scenarios.Results: The results demonstrated that using a TLSO immediately decreases forefoot pressures in stasis, and around the first metatarsal, as well as pressures relating to the second to fifth metatarsals under dynamic conditions. Hindfoot pressures were increased, but not significantly.Conclusion: This study showed that using a TLSO can be beneficial for elderly people with hyperkyphosis.Implications for rehabilitationThe ageing process can be accompanied by a degeneration of the spine and increase the risk of thoracic hyperkyphosis.The use of corrective orthotic bracing has been shown to improve spinal posture, and increase stability and balance amongst the elderly.Using a TLSO decreases forefoot pressures in stasis, and around the first metatarsal, as well as pressures relating to the second to fifth metatarsals under dynamic conditions."

  "date": "2019 Jun 1",
  "abstract": "The squat exercise is a fundamental movement in athletic training and rehabilitation. In this study, we measured muscle activities in a normal squat posture (NSP) and a squat posture with the center of foot pressure (COP) intentionally shifted forward as far as possible (FSP). Ten healthy men performed double-limb squats, adopting the NSP and FSP, with three knee flexion angles (30, 60, and 90 degrees). The muscle activities of the vastus medialis (VM), semitendinosus (ST), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius muscle lateral head (GL) were measured using surface electromyography, and activity patterns were analyzed. Compared to that for the NSP, the COP was significantly shifted forward in the FSP by at least 30% of the foot length for all knee flexion angles (p < 0.05). At all knee flexion angles, VM muscle activity significantly decreased, while GL muscle activity increased, in the FSP compared to that for the NSP (p < 0.05). In addition, ST muscle activity increased significantly in the FSP compared to that for the NSP at knee flexion angles of 30 and 60 degrees (p < 0.05). TA muscle activity significantly decreased in the FSP compared to that for the NSP at only 90 degrees of knee flexion (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that muscle activity patterns vary significantly according to squat posture. Thus, the active control of the COP position during the squat can be a new training approach in targeting specific muscle groups."

  "abstract": "Background: Photogrammetric measures are a commonly applied, highly reliable tool for appraising craniovertebral postures during clinical assessments, rehabilitation, and research interventions.\nObjective: This study aimed to compare and contrast three external measures of postural alignment (EMPA) using photogrammetric and radiological approaches, and to discuss whether the craniovertebral angle (CVA) reflects the shape of the underlying cervical spine.\nDesign: Cross Sectional Correlation Study.\nMethod: Young adults attended three assessment sessions (S1, S2 and S3). S1 involved a standardised photogrammetric protocol. S2 involved radiographic image acquisition. S3 followed the same protocol in S1 but excluded the self-balancing procedure. Each session's EMPA were compared through either paired or independent samples t-tests. The different radiographic cervical subtypes and their corresponding CVAs were assessed.\nResults: There were no significant differences in any EMPA between the two photogrammetric sessions. The CVA was the only EMPA to show a significant difference between photogrammetric (S3) and radiographic approaches. Cervical subtype variability is present throughout the full CVA range.\nConclusions: Despite the statistically significant difference in the CVA between approaches, the mean difference was small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Accordingly, the quantification of EMPA can be undertaken with high levels of precision and reliability using standardised photogrammetric procedures. The CVA, however, does not provide an indication of the shape of the underlying cervical spine. The distinct radiological differences in the inter-segmental orientation of each vertebral motion segment in conjunction with the differences in the overall global cervical alignment, both within and between participants, negate this possibility."

  "title": "Thoracic Posture and Mobility in Mechanical Neck Pain Population: A Review of the Literature",
  "date": "2019 Jun 3",
  "abstract": "Neck pain is a common condition with several proposed biomechanical contributing factors. Thoracic spine dysfunction is hypothesized as one of the predisposing factors, which necessitates the need to explore the contribution of thoracic posture and mobility toward neck pain. Accordingly, the present work aimed to review the existing literature investigating the presence of thoracic spine dysfunction in individuals with neck pain. A literature search was conducted in the three electronic databases of PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Studies published between 1990 and 2017 were considered. After reviewing the abstracts, two authors independently scrutinized the full-text documents for their relevance. The initial search yielded 2,167 articles, of which nine studies involving comparisons of neck pain patients and healthy controls were identified for the review. Increased thoracic kyphosis was positively correlated with the presence of forward head posture but not uniformly associated with neck pain intensity and disability. Thoracic mobility was reduced in the neck pain population, and the role of thoracic kyphosis as a risk factor for pain development could not be confirmed. Thus, an association exists between thoracic kyphosis and postural alteration in the cervical spine. The review favors the inclusion of thoracic spine assessment and treatment in mechanical neck pain patients. Further studies are needed to investigate the cause-effect relationship between thoracic posture and cervical dysfunction."

  "date": "2019 Mar-Apr",
  "abstract": "Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the influence of forward head posture on the mechanical parameters and pressure pain threshold of superficial neck muscles in clinically nonsymptomatic individuals with sedentary jobs.\nMethods: Twenty-five office workers with forward head posture and 25 office workers with normal head posture were matched for sex, age, body mass index, and the nature and duration of their work and were compared at a single point. The study participants were divided into study groups on the basis of photometric craniovertebral angle measurements. The upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and splenius capitis mechanical properties were assessed in the sitting position. Primary outcome measures were muscle stiffness (N/m), muscle tone (Hz), and muscle elasticity. The secondary variable was perceived pain threshold.\nResults: No significant differences between the groups were found for biomechanical properties and perceived pain threshold in the studied muscles.\nConclusion: Forward head posture has no impact on muscle stiffness, tone, and elasticity, nor does it increase the pressure sensitivity of superficial neck muscles in healthy, mildly symptomatic office workers. It is most likely that not incorrect posture of the cervical spine, but probably other factors combined with forward head posture, like comorbid acute and chronic cervical pain and musculoskeletal disorders or prolonged sitting, contribute to changes in active myofascial tone and tensegrity as well as increased pressure sensitivity of neck muscles."

  "abstract": "Aims: Neck pain is common in migraine and tension type headache (TTH). This review aimed to examine the evidence for cervical musculoskeletal impairments in these headaches.\nMethods: Databases PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were searched from inception to December 2018. Observational studies using a comparator group were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. Results were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. Level of evidence for each outcome was assigned based on risk of bias, consistency of results and magnitude of difference between participants with headache and controls. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42018083683).\nResults: Of 48 studies included, the majority were rated moderate risk of bias due to possible confounding influences. In total, 17 cervical outcomes were assessed, with confidence in findings ranging from very low to moderate levels. Compared to controls, participants with TTH had greater forward head posture (FHP) (MD = -6.18°, 95% CI [-8.18°, -4.18°]) and less cervical range of motion (ROM) (greatest difference transverse plane MD = -15.0°, 95% CI [-27.7°, -2.3°]. Participants with migraine demonstrated minimally reduced cervical ROM (greatest difference sagittal plane MD = -5.4°, 95% CI [-9.9°, -0.9°]. No differences presented in head posture, strength, craniocervical flexion test performance or joint position error between migraineurs and controls.\nConclusions: TTH presented with more findings of cervical musculoskeletal impairments than migraine however levels of confidence in findings were low. Future studies should differentiate episodic from chronic headache, identify coexisting musculoskeletal cervical disorders, and describe neck pain behaviour in headache."

  "abstract": "Context: Upper crossed syndrome is caused by weakness in one group of muscles and tightness in other group of muscles. Deep-neck flexor weakness and tight pectorals and sternocleidomastoid contribute to this syndrome. This syndrome mainly arises as a result of muscular imbalance that usually develops between weak and tonic muscles. Laundry workers tend to develop this syndrome due to the nature of their work.\nAims: The aim of the study is to find the prevalence of upper crossed syndrome in laundry workers.\nSubjects and methods: A prevalence study was conducted among laundry workers. Laundry workers were selected by random sampling method. They were assessed by performing various special tests for tightness and weakness of the muscles. Oswestry neck disability index questionnaire was then filled up by the population included.\nResults: Data from fifty laundry workers were obtained and analyzed. The symptoms of upper crossed syndrome were present (n = 14) in the population with mild neck disability (n = 4) and moderate neck disability (n = 11) and no disability (n = 35).\nConclusions: These findings reported in the study provide a better understanding of impact and the extent of upper crossed syndrome. We found out that there is a significant prevalence of upper crossed syndrome in laundry workers. Neck pain presents as the main symptom, and these patients also present with forward head-and-neck posture."

Group 1 received 6-week scapular stabilization exercises with abdominal control feedback (n = 45), group 2 received 6-week scapular stabilization exercises without abdominal control feedback (n = 45), and group 3 received active self-exercise as a control group (n = 45). Posture, pain, proprioception, strength, and electromyography were assessed before and after the interventions.\nResults: There were significant between-group differences in pain, proprioception, strength, and electromyography favoring group 1. There were significant within-group changes in posture, pain, proprioception, strength, and electromyography in both groups 1 and 2. No significant change was observed for muscle strength.\nConclusion: The addition of abdominal control feedback to the scapular stabilization exercises was shown to be superior to the scapular stabilization exercises alone for decreasing neck pain and restoring proper proprioception, strength, and electromyography in females with forward head and round shoulder postures and neck movement impairment.\nClinical relevance: The addition of abdominal control feedback to scapular stabilization exercises is superior to scapular stabilization exercises alone on the neck for improving electromyography, strength, and function in females with forward head and round shoulder postures and neck movement impairment."

  "date": "2019 Jun",
  "abstract": "Introduction: The aim of this exploratory study was to assess the EEG correlates of head positions (which have never been studied in humans) in participants with different psychophysiological characteristics, as encoded by their hypnotizability scores. This choice is motivated by earlier studies suggesting different processing of vestibular/neck proprioceptive information in subjects with high (highs) and low (lows) hypnotizability scores maintaining their head rotated toward one side (RH).\nMethods: We analyzed EEG signals recorded in 20 highs and 19 lows in basal conditions (head forward) and during RH using spectral analysis, which captures changes localized to specific recording sites, and topological data analysis (TDA), which instead describes large-scale differences in processing and representing sensorimotor information.\nResults: Spectral analysis revealed significant differences related to head position for alpha 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma bands, but not to hypnotizability. TDA instead revealed global hypnotizability-related differences in the strengths of the correlations among recording sites during RH. Significant changes were observed in lows on the left parieto-occipital side and in highs in right frontoparietal region. Significant differences between the two groups were found in the occipital region, where changes were larger in lows than in highs.\nConclusions: This study reports finding of the EEG correlates of changes in the head posture for the first time, indicating that hypnotizability is related to the head posture representation/processing on large-scale networks and that spectral and topological data analyses provide complementary results."

From 639 reports identified from electronic databases, 11 were eligible to include in the review. One paper was found from the list of references and added to the review. The quality scores were rated as moderate. The results show that muscle activity of upper trapezius, erector spinae and the neck extensor muscles are increased as well as head flexion angle, head tilt angle and forward head shifting which increased during the smartphone use. Also, smartphone use in a sitting position seems to cause more shift in head-neck angle than in a standing position. Smartphone usage may contribute to musculoskeletal disorders. The findings of the included papers should be interpreted carefully in light of the issues highlighted by the moderate-quality assessment scores."

  "title": "Anatomic considerations in headaches associated with cervical sagittal imbalance: A cadaveric biomechanical study",
  "date": "2019 Jul",
  "abstract": "Chronic Forward Head Posture is associated with headaches, neck pain, and disability, though few studies have investigated the effects it has on the suboccipital triangle. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess whether the biomechanical changes in the suboccipital triangle help explain the clinical manifestations of Forward Head Posture. Specifically, this study aimed to identify whether the Greater Occipital Nerve or C2 nerve root may be compressed in Forward Head Posture. Three-dimensional, specimen-specific computer models were rendered from thirteen cadaveric cervical spine specimens. The spines transitioned from neutral to Forward head posture while motion data was collected. This data was synced with the computer models to make precise measurements. In Forward Head Posture, occiput-C1, C1-C2, and occiput-C2 segments extended by 10.7 ± 4.6 deg, 4.6 ± 4.3 deg, and 15.3 ± 2.3 deg, respectively. The Rectus Capitis Posterior Major and Minor and Obliquus Capitis Superior muscles shortened by 20.0 ± 4.6%, 15.0 ± 7.6%, and 6.6 ± 3.3%, respectively. The Obliquus Capitis muscle inferior length did not change. The suboccipital triangle area decreased by 18.7 ± 6.4%, but the protective gaps surrounding the C2 nerve root and the Greater Occipital Nerve did not reveal clinically significant impingement. The C2 nerve root gap decreased by 1.0 ± 1.3 mm and the Greater Occipital Nerve gap by 0.2 ± 0.18 mm. These results demonstrate that the C2 nerve root and the Greater Occipital Nerve are protected by the bony landscape of the cervical spine. However, there is likely persistent contraction of the rectus muscles in Forward Head Posture, which suggests a secondary tension-type etiology of the associated headache."

  "title": "[Frequent postural alterations in patients with different types of temporomandibular disorders]",
  "date": "2018 May-Jun",
  "abstract": "Objective: To describe postural alterations according to the type of temporomandibular disorder (TMD).\nMethods: Prior informed consent, 30 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 27.4 years; 80% women, diagnosed with TMD based on Diagnostic Criteria (DC/ TTM) by a trained researcher in the clinic of the Faculty of Stomatology of the BUAP. Subsequently, a postural analysis (three views) was carried out at the facilities of the School of Physiotherapy of the BUAP using an acetate grid. The results were analyzed with descriptive statistics in the SPSS v20 program.\nResults: 16.7% of the patients presented muscular TMD, 36.7% joint TMD, and the rest combined TMD. The most common postural alterations were: high shoulder: 93.3%, pelvic tilt: 86.7%, and forward head posture: 83.3%. On average, the patients had between 4 and 5 postural changes. 100% of the patients ha alterations in the side view, while 50% of the patients with TMD of combined origin had alterations in the three views, as well as 45.5% of the patients with TMD of joint origin, and 60% of the patients with TMD of muscular origin.\nConclusions: TMD patients present postural changes, mainly forward head posture, pelvic tilt and high shoulder, with special involvement related to muscle and combined diagnosis."

  "title": "Exploring the association between number, severity, location of fracture, and occiput-to-wall distance",
  "date": "2019 Feb 28",
  "abstract": "This study of women with a suspected vertebral fracture determined the association between vertebral fracture characteristics and posture. The number of fractures was associated with posture. Severity of fracture was associated with posture when adjusting for pain. Fracture characteristics explain some variability in posture in women with a suspected vertebral fracture.\nPurpose: Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. An accumulation of vertebral fractures may lead to forward head posture, which has been independently associated with mortality. It is unclear how fracture characteristics, including the number, severity, and location of fracture, contribute to occiput-to-wall distance (OWD).\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional secondary data analysis using baseline data from a randomized controlled trial, in community-dwelling women aged 65 years and older with a suspected vertebral fragility fracture. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were used to determine the number, location, and severity of fracture. Occiput-to-wall distance (OWD) was used to assess forward head posture. Pain during movement (0-10 scale) and age were considered as confounding variables. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate relationships between fracture variables and OWD.\nResults: Participants (n = 158) were of mean age 75.9 (SD 6.5) years with a mean (SD) BMI = 26.7 (5.3) kg/m2, OWD = 5.7 (4.6) cm, and number of fractures = 2.4 (2.4). In unadjusted analyses, the number of fractures (B = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.04, 1.59) was associated with OWD. When adjusting for pain, severity of fractures (B = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.001, 2.15) was independently associated with OWD. Location was not associated with OWD in any of the models.\nConclusions: The number of fractures was significantly associated with OWD in the unadjusted model, explaining more of the variability in OWD than other fracture characteristics. Severity of fracture was associated with OWD in the adjusted model. However, pain may confound the relationship between OWD and fracture characteristics."

  "title": "Non-pharmacological treatment of chronic neck-shoulder myofascial pain in patients with forward head posture",
  "date": "2019",
  "abstract": "Objective: Introduction: Today, chronic pain remains a pressing medical and socio-economic problem, despite the rapid development of medical technologies, the presence of a vast arsenal of drug and non-drug treatments. Estimates for chronic pain prevalence ranged from 8% to 60%. At the same time, about 40% of patients report insufficient effectiveness in the treatment of chronic pain syndrome. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of MTrPS management by biomechanical correction of the musculoskeletal system combined with therapeutic exercises, DN and TrPs-pressure release with the effectiveness of MTrPS management by therapeutic exercises combined with DN and TrPs-pressure release in patients with chronic neck-shoulder myofascial pain and FHP.\nPatients and methods: Materials and methods: 87 patients (mean age - 39±4,9 years) with chronic neck-shoulder myofascial pain and FHP were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups. Group 1 received a biomechanical correction, DN, TrPs-pressure release. Group 2 - therapeutic exercises, DN, TrPs-pressure release. Study protocol included CVA-measurement, assessment of pain intensity with VAS, assessment of QoL using MOS SF-36.\nResults: Results: increase of CVA (59,07°±1,41 in the 1st group, and 51,2°±2,01 in the 2nd group (p=0,036)), decrease of pain and decrease of influence of neck pain in performance of everyday activities, the improvement of QoL immediately after treatment occurred in both groups. However, after 3 months of therapy, 1-st group revealed more improvement than the 2-nd.\nConclusion: Conclusion: Comparison of the effectiveness of MTrPS management by biomechanical correction of the musculoskeletal system combined with therapeutic exercises, DN and TrPs-pressure release with the effectiveness of MTrPS management by therapeutic exercises combined with DN and TrPs-pressure release in patients with chronic neck-shoulder myofascial pain and FHP demonstrated no significant differences between the therapeutic approaches in the short term. In the medium term, the inclusion of biomechanical correction in the treatment protocol demonstrated higher efficiency compared with the combination of therapeutic exercises, DN and TrPs-pressure release."

  "title": "Compliant legs enable lizards to maintain high running speeds on complex terrains",
  "date": "2019 Mar 21",
  "abstract": "Substrate variations are likely to constrain animal performance in natural environments, as running over complex terrains challenges the dynamic stability of the body differently in each step. Yet, being able to negotiate complex terrains at top speed is a strong advantage for animals that have to deal with predators and evasive prey. Little is known on how animals negotiate such terrain variability at high speed. We investigated this in fast-running Acanthodactylus boskianus lizards, by measuring their 3D kinematics using four synchronised high-speed video cameras (325 Hz) on an adaptable racetrack. This racetrack was covered with four different substrates, representing increasing levels of terrain complexity. We found that the lizards deal with this complexity gradient by gradually adopting more erect parasagittal leg postures. Legs in a more-erect position are more compliant and are therefore highly adjustable on complex terrains. Additionally, the lizards stabilise their head, which facilitates vestibular and visual perception. Together, compliant legs and head stabilisation enable the lizards to minimise movements of the body centre of mass, even when running on highly irregular terrains. This suggests that the head and the centre of mass are the priority targets for running on uneven terrains. As a result, running performance (mean forward speed) decreases only slightly, and only on the most challenging substrate under investigation."

  "date": "2019 Feb 27",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The head constitutes 6% of the total body weight, which is linked to the cervical spine and all other joints through the kinematic chain by various muscles. The forward head posture is one of the most common postural disorders and seems to be especially dangerous. The goal of the work was to assess the impact of 4 weeks of training neck and nape muscles on the head posture.\nMaterial and methods: The subjects were 20 participants, who performed neck exercises for 20 days. The head posture in a sagittal and frontal plane was assessed photogrammetrically twice: before and after the exercises. The following have been used for the assessment: craniovertebral (CV) angle, head tilt angle (HT), and frontal head tilt angle (FHT).\nResults: After a 20-day program of neck and nape exercises the values of specific angles were compared. The results indicated significant changes in the head posture. In the sagittal plane: the average value of the CV angle before the training was 47.17°, and 50.82° after the training; the average value of the HT angle before the exercises was at 20.99°, and 24.31° after. In the frontal plane the average value of the FHT angle before the exercises was at 2.71°, and after 20 days of training the average value of this angle decreased to 2°.\nConclusions: The results demonstrate that a short, home-based targeted exercise program can improve head posture.

  "date": "2019 Feb 18",
  "abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a six-week combined manual therapy (MT) and stabilizing exercises (SEs), with a one-month follow-up on neck pain and improving function and posture in patients with forward head and rounded shoulder postures (FHRSP).\nMethods: Sixty women with neck pain and FHRSP were randomized into three groups: Group 1 performed SE and received MT (n = 20), Group 2 performed SE (n = 20) and Group 3 performed home exercises (n = 20) for six weeks. The follow-up time was one month after the post test. The pain, function, and head and shoulder angles were measured before and after the six-week interventions, and during a one-month follow-up.\nResults: There were significant within-group improvements in pain, function, and head and shoulder posture in groups 1 and 2. There were significant between-group differences in groups 1 and 2 in head posture, pain, and function favoring group 1 with effect size 0.432(p = 0.041), 0.533 (P = 0.038), and 0.565(P = 0.018) respectively. There were significant between-group differences in both intervention groups versus the control group favoring the intervention groups.\nConclusion: These findings suggest that both interventions were significantly effective in reducing neck pain and improving function and posture in patients. However, the improvement in function and pain were more effective in Group 1 as compared to Group 2, suggesting that MT can be used as a supplementary method to the stabilizing intervention in the treatment of neck pain. More researches are needed to confirm the result of this study.\nTrial registration: UMIN000030141 modified on 2018.03.08.

  "abstract": "[Purpose] This study investigated the effect of forward head posture on upper and lower thoracic shape in adults to better understand the relationship between a forward head posture and respiratory function. [Participants and Methods] Fifteen healthy males were recruited after obtaining informed consent from all participants. All participants were instructed to respire in both the forward and neutral head postures while seated. Respiratory function was assessed using spirometry. Thoracic shape during respiration was assessed using 23 markers on both the upper and the lower thorax and compared between the 2 postures. [Results] Forced vital capacity, expiratory and inspiratory reserve volumes, forced expiratory volume at 1 second, and the peak flow rate observed with the forward head posture were significantly lower than that with the neutral head posture. The upper thorax showed a greater forward shift and the lower thorax showed a greater forward and inward shift with the forward head posture than with the neutral head posture. No significant difference in upper thoracic mobility was observed during respiration between the forward head posture and the neutral head posture. However, mobility of the lower thorax during respiration was significantly reduced with the forward head posture. [Conclusion] The forward head posture causes expansion of the upper thorax and contraction of the lower thorax, and these morphological changes cause decreased respiratory function."

  "title": "Comparison of immediate effects of sling-based manual therapy on specific spine levels in subjects with neck pain and forward head posture: a randomized clinical trial",
  "date": "2020 Sep",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Forward head posture is identified as the flexion of the lower cervical spine along with the extension of the upper cervical spine, with an overall increase in the cervical curve. This study aimed to compare the immediate effect of upper-cervical level and cervicothoracic junction level manual therapy on head posture, cervical range of motion and muscle activity of the subjects with forward head posture.Methods: A total 22 subjects with chronic neck pain (numeric pain rating scale >3, forward head posture: cranio-vertebral angle <51°) participated in the study and were randomly allocated into the upper-cervical (n = 11) and cervicothoracic junction (n = 11) groups. Cranio-vertebral angle, cervical range of motion, and electromyography amplitude during performance of the craniocervical flexion test were measured before and immediately after the intervention.Results/findings: There were no significant main effects for the group by time outcome score of craniovertebral angle and electromyography amplitude. However, in the range of motion of the cervical area, the cervicothoracic junction group showed a significant increase in extension and right rotation than the upper-cervical group (p < 0.05). Moreover, in both groups, the electromyography amplitude of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was significantly reduced after intervention. The electromyography amplitude of the anterior scalene muscle in only the cervicothoracic junction group was significantly reduced after intervention (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Cervicothoracic junction manual therapy improved cervical alignment, cervical mobility (extension, rotation), and muscle recruitment ability in subjects with forward head posture. These observations may partially explain the efficacy of this manual therapy in rehabilitation of individuals with mechanical neck disorder (with forward head posture).Implications for rehabilitationForward head posture is identified as the flexion of the lower cervical spine along with the extension of the upper cervical spine, with an overall increase in the cervical curve.Cervicothoracic area manual therapy in subjects with neck pain and forward head posture better improved the muscle recruitment ability than upper cervical area manual therapy during motor tasks."

  "date": "2018 Nov-Dec",
  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between head and neck posture and superficial neck flexor and extensor activity during performance of the craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) in women with migraine and healthy controls.\nMethods: Fifty-two women with episodic migraine, 16 with chronic migraine, and 23 healthy controls participated. Head and neck posture were determined by assessing the craniovertebral (CV) angle and cervical lordosis angle. Surface electromyography signals were recorded bilaterally from sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene, splenius capitis, and upper trapezius muscles as participants performed the CCFT. Differences in electromyogram activity and posture among groups were compared with analyses of variance. Correlations between posture and electromyogram activity were analyzed with the Pearson correlation coefficient.\nResults: Both migraine groups had a significant increase in splenius capitis muscle activity, when acting as an antagonist, at the last stage of CCFT (F = 4.687; P = .012) compared with controls. No differences among groups were observed for head and neck posture. No significant correlation was found in the episodic migraine group. Moderate correlations between the CV angle and upper trapezius activity at the majority stages of the CCFT (-0.61 < r < -0.65, all P < .05) were observed within the chronic migraine group: the more extended the head posture, the higher the activity of the upper trapezius muscle. The CV angle also was correlated with upper trapezius muscle activity at the first stage of the CCFT and with splenius capitis muscle activity at the last stages (-0.42 < r < -0.52; P < .05).\nConclusion: An extended (forward) head posture was moderately correlated with an increased in electrical activity of superficial neck extensor muscles, particularly the upper trapezius, when acting as an antagonist, during the performance of the CCFT in women with chronic but not episodic migraine."

  "title": "Neck posture is influenced by anticipation of stepping",
  "date": "2019 Apr",
  "abstract": "Background: Postural deviations such as forward head posture (FHP) are associated with adverse health effects. The causes of these deviations are poorly understood. We hypothesized that anticipating target-directed movement could cause the head to get \"ahead of\" the body, interfering with optimal head/neck posture, and that the effect may be exacerbated by task difficulty and/or poor inhibitory control.\nMethod: We assessed posture in 45 healthy young adults standing quietly and when they anticipated walking to place a tray: in a simple condition and in conditions requiring that they bend low or balance an object on the tray. We defined FHP as neck angle relative to torso; we also measured head angle relative to neck and total neck length. We assessed inhibitory control using a Go/No-Go task, Stroop task, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS).\nResults: FHP increased when participants anticipated movement, particularly for more difficult movements. Worse Stroop performance and lower MAAS scores correlated with higher FHP. False alarms on the Go/No-Go task correlated with a more extended head relative to the neck and with shortening of the neck when anticipating movement.\nConclusions: Maintaining neutral posture may require inhibition of an impulse to put the head forward of the body when anticipating target-directed movement."

  "title": "Effort to perceive the position of one visual horizontal line relative to another appearing close causes an earlier postural response to backward perturbation",
  "date": "2019 Feb 6",
  "abstract": "Humans make an effort to stabilize the body when a stable eye position is required to improve visibility. Perceiving the position of one visual object relative to another appearing close is relatively difficult compared with perceiving those objects appearing at a distance. Thus, humans must make an effort to stabilize their body to improve visibility when they attempt to perceive the position of one object relative to another appearing close. This process may enhance the response to postural perturbation. The present study tested this hypothesis. A total of 15 healthy participants maintained a position standing over the platform and gazed at a horizontal fixation line in front of them. One of the two warning sound cues was given in each trial; one predicted the forthcoming appearance of a horizontal line 2 mm above or below the horizontal fixation line (indistinct condition), and another predicted the forthcoming appearance of the horizontal line 2 cm above or 2 cm below the horizontal fixation line (distinct condition). After the warning sound cue, the support surface moved in the forward or backward direction. A horizontal line appeared 40 ms after the onset of the support surface motion at the level above or below the horizontal fixation line with the distance from the horizontal fixation line as the warning cue predicted. The participants verbally stated the position of the horizontal line relative to the horizontal fixation line after the offset of the support surface movement. The displacement of the head and sacrum was measured with acceleration sensors. A test of the simple main effect following an analysis of variance revealed that the peak downward displacement of the pelvis in the indistinct condition was significantly earlier than that in the distinct condition. This finding indicated that the effort to stabilize the body for improvement of visibility enhances the response of the pelvis to the forward movement of the support surface. This effect may be used for improvement of the postural response in patients with problems with postural control."

  "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the study was to provide a computerized photogrammetric description of the postural alignment of visually impaired athletes.\nMethods: Twenty-six athletes were evaluated. Athletes were asked to stand at easy with styrofoam balls placed on selected anatomical landmarks, and photographic images were acquired in four viewpoints. Postural Assessment Software (PAS/SAPO) was applied for image analysis. Body's angles and distances were calculated and transformed in absolute (nonnegative) values for analysis. Factor analysis was applied for data reduction.\nResults: Absolute values of PAS/SAPO variables resulted in lower coefficient of variation (CV) than raw values (average of 57% versus 500%, respectively), which potentially enhances the comparative use of these measures. Head's forward positioning and rightward inclination were among the most prevalent postural deviation, being observed in more than 70% of the athletes. With respect to the magnitude of the deviation, large variability was observed in data derived from anterior/posterior compared with lateral viewpoint. For instance, head's rightward inclination (head horizontal alignment in the anterior view) achieved 2.9 ± 2.5° (mean ± SD), with a CV of 86%, while head's forward positioning (C7 horizontal alignment in left viewpoint) reaches 42.7 ± 6.6°, with a CV of only 16%. Factor analysis did not result in significant data reduction, although anterior body's angles and distances were identified as important sources of data variability.\nConclusions: The PAS/SAPO values described here can be adopted as reference for future investigations of postural alignment in visually impaired athletes."

  "date": "2019 May 1",
  "abstract": "Background: Most patients with migraine report associated neck pain. Whether neck pain is a symptom of migraine or an indicator for associated cervical musculoskeletal impairment has not yet been determined. Physical examination tests to detect cervical impairments in people with headache have been suggested, but results have not been evaluated systematically and combined in meta-analyses.\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to identify musculoskeletal impairments in people with migraine and people who were healthy (healthy controls) by reviewing published data on physical examination results.\nData sources: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials were searched for studies published prior to December 2017.\nStudy selection: Publications investigating physical examination procedures that are feasible for use in a physical therapy setting for patients with migraine and healthy controls were independently selected by 2 researchers.\nData extraction: One researcher extracted the data into predesigned data extraction tables. Entries were checked for correctness by a second researcher. The Downs and Black Scale was used for risk-of-bias assessment by 2 reviewers independently.\nData synthesis: Thirty-five studies (involving 1033 participants who were healthy [healthy controls] and 1371 participants with migraine) were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 18 were included in the meta-analyses (544 healthy controls and 603 participants with migraine). Overall, studies were rated as having a low to moderate risk of bias. Included studies reported 20 different test procedures. Combined mean effects indicated that 4 of the tests included in the meta-analyses distinguished between patients and controls: range of cervical motion, flexion-rotation, pressure pain thresholds, and forward head posture in a standing position.\nLimitations: Manual joint testing and evaluation of trigger points were the 2 most frequently investigated tests not included in the meta-analyses because of heterogeneity of reporting and procedures.\nConclusions: Three tests confirmed the presence of musculoskeletal impairments in participants with migraine when combined in meta-analyses. Pressure pain thresholds added information on sensory processing. Additional tests might be useful but require standardized protocols and reporting."

The aim of the present study was to identify and assess critically the evidence on the functional changes associated with NP in adolescents, specifically for: (a) posture; (b) postural control; (c) range of motion; (d) proprioception; (e) muscle function; and (f) sensory threshold.\nMethods: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, PEdro, Scielo, Scopus and Academic Search Premier databases for relevant studies. Two reviewers screened studies for inclusion and assessed the quality of the included studies. One reviewer extracted relevant data from the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed for studies that measured forward head posture (FHP).\nResults: Ten studies were included and a total of 15 comparisons for different variables were made. When compared with adolescents without NP, those with NP showed no differences in cervicothoracic posture or FHP. However, statistically significant differences were found for range of motion: weighted mean difference (WMD) from -14.0° (-21.1° to -1.1°) to 9.4° (2.8° to 16.0°); flexor muscle endurance: WMD -11.4 (-21.8 to -0.9) s; extensor muscle endurance: WMD -42.0 (-77.8 to -6.3) s; joint repositioning error for right and left rotation: WMD 1.9° (0.8° to 2.9°) and 2.4° (1.3° to 3.5°), respectively; and pressure pain threshold: WMD from -15.6 (-18.5 to -12.8) to -9.3 (-11.3 to 7.2) N/ cm².\nConclusion: There is very limited to limited evidence that there is no difference in posture between adolescents with and without NP, and that there is a difference for range of motion, muscle function, proprioception and pressure pain threshold."

  "title": "Noisy Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation Primarily Affects Otolith-Mediated Motion Perception",
  "date": "2019 Feb 10",
  "abstract": "Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) has been shown to improve vestibular perception in healthy subjects. However, it is unclear whether both the semicircular canals (SCCs) and otolith organs contribute to this enhancement or is it confined to one of these structures. To elucidate this matter, nGVS amplitudes with optimal effect on postural control were determined in 12 healthy subjects during upright stance. These amplitudes were then applied during perceptual direction-recognition tasks in inter-aural translation (otolith-mediated perception) as well as yaw rotation with the head pitched forward 71 deg (SCC-mediated perception) and compared to sham stimulation. Nine out of 12 subjects showed significantly improved direction-recognition thresholds in the inter-aural translation task during nGVS compared to sham stimulation (p ≤ 0.03; mean threshold reduction: 38.8%). Only 6 of 12 subjects showed mild improvements in the yaw rotation task during nGVS (p > 0.05). In addition, elevated baseline thresholds during the inter-aural translation task significantly correlated with a larger magnitude of improvement (R = 0.72, p = 0.01). In conclusion, nGVS appears to primarily impact otolith-mediated perception while only mildly affecting the SCCs. Thus, this stimulation approach could be a complementary candidate to vestibular implants that are currently limited to SCC-mediated vestibular function."

The volunteers were allocated to either, with pain (n = 22), or without pain (n = 22) groups, and pain was evaluated using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale.\nResults: The FHP in the pain group showed a significant difference in the CVA, and the cervical ROM in both flexion and extension, compared with those in the FHP without pain group (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the occurrence of cervical area pain was higher amongst subjects who had a decreased CVA and flexion motion.\nConclusion: This study suggested that decreased CVA and cervical flexion range, were predictive factors for the occurrence of pain in the cervical region."

  "abstract": "Background: Although commonly utilized treatments, no study has directly compared the effectiveness of joint mobilization and stabilization exercise in individuals with forward head posture (FHP).\nObjective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of upper cervical and upper thoracic spine mobilization versus deep cervical flexors exercise (DCFE) in individuals with FHP.\nMethods: Thirty-one participants with FHP were randomized into the mobilization (n= 15) or exercise (n= 16) group. The treatment period was 4 weeks with follow-up assessment at 4 weeks and 6 weeks after the initial examination. Outcomes assessed included the craniovertebral angle (CVA), numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), respiratory function, and the global rating of change (GRC).\nResults: Participants in the mobilization group demonstrated significant improvements (p< 0.05) in CVA, NPRS, and respiratory function, as compared to those in the exercise group. In addition, 9 of 15 (60%) participants in the mobilization group, as compared to 4 of 16 participants (25%) in the exercise group, had a GRC score of +4 or higher.\nConclusions: The combination of upper cervical and upper thoracic spine mobilization indicated better overall short-term outcomes in CVA, NPRS, respiratory function, and GRC compared with DCFE in individuals with FHP."

  "date": "2019 Mar-Apr",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The aim of the study was to verify associations among degenerative changes in the cervical spine, head and neck postures, and myofascial pain in the craniocervical musculature in elderly with myofascial temporomandibular disorders (TMDs).\nMethods: A total of 120 participants (mean age, 68.3 ± 7.5 years) were included: 45 participants had no signs of orofacial or cervical pain, 26 participants had myofascial TMD only (mTMD), and 49 participants had both myofascial TMD and cervical pain (cerTMD). Participants were diagnosed according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. Cervical spine degeneration and head and neck postures were identified using the lateral cephalogram. Myofascial trigger points (TrPs) were evaluated in the temporalis, masseter, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, sub-occipitalis, and splenius capitis muscles. Relationships among number of TrPs, head postures, and cervical degeneration were investigated using repeated-measure analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation coefficient.\nResults: The cerTMD showed higher number of active TrPs in the masticatory and cervical muscles, greater forward head posture, and more severe degenerative changes in the cervical spine than mTMD did. The degenerative changes in each level of the cervical spine had complex interactions with head postures. Cervical degeneration, particularly at level of second to third vertebra appeared to be linked to the development of active TrPs in the masticatory and cervical muscles.\nConclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that degenerative changes in the cervical spine were related to altered head postures and the development of active TrPs in the craniocervical musculature in elderly with myofascial TMD."

  "title": "Gait festination in parkinsonism: introduction of two phenotypes",
  "date": "2019 Feb",
  "abstract": "Gait festination is one of the most characteristic gait disturbances in patients with Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism. Although festination is common and disabling, it has received little attention in the literature, and different definitions exist. Here, we argue that there are actually two phenotypes of festination. The first phenotype entails a primary locomotion disturbance, due to the so-called sequence effect: a progressive shortening of step length, accompanied by a compensatory increase in cadence. This phenotype strongly relates to freezing of gait with alternating trembling of the leg. The second phenotype results from a postural control problem (forward leaning of the trunk) combined with a balance control deficit (inappropriately small balance-correcting steps). In this viewpoint, we elaborate on the possible pathophysiological substrate of these two phenotypes of festination and discuss their management in daily clinical practice."

  "date": "2018 Dec",
  "abstract": "Aims: Back strain is a common musculoskeletal complaint affecting musicians, which may be related to unsuitable playing positions causing fatigue and muscle tension. In this study, three saxophone-carrying systems (neck-strap, shoulder-strap, and Saxholder) were examined for their effects on spinal column kinematics.\nMethods: The influence of saxophone-carrying systems was investigated in 14 physically healthy alto saxophonists using ultrasound topometry. Additional tests were performed on 1 subject to examine the influence of the different weights of alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones with the three different carrying systems.\nResults: The clearest difference between two systems (shoulder-strap vs Saxholder) was found in the angle at which the player's head bows forward while playing (3.35°; 95% CI 0.44, 6.26; p=0.0272). The use of the Saxholder resulted in a physiologically favorable axial position of the head. The head posture to ankle distance showed that the shoulder-strap and Saxholder, compared to the neck-strap, allowed a sagittal straightening and therefore advantageous axially balanced body position, although the differences were not statistically significant. The Saxholder also enabled a stabilization in the frontal section of the shoulders. In additional tests on 1 subject, the coefficient of variation showed that the instruments' weights had a larger influence on the physiologically favorable balanced body position than the different carrying systems.\nConclusion: This pilot study was able to show that the technique of sonometric examination (Zebris) is an effective way to investigate the influence of instrument-carrying systems on the kinematics of the spine. The Saxholder may be physiologically advantageous, but further research with a larger sample is needed to verify the findings."

  "title": "Some Effects of Supplemental Pilates Training on the Posture, Strength, and Flexibility of Dancers 17 to 22 Years of Age",
  "date": "2018 Dec 1",
  "abstract": "Proper alignment in dancers is a pre-requisite for achieving aesthetic line and form and for efficient execution of movement. Pelvic alignment is a common deficit in dancers that results in faulty technique and impaired performance. Dancers must be able to obtain their personal neutral alignment to avoid injury and achieve ease of execution. This study was designed to examine the effects, qualitatively and quantitatively, of Pilates training on pelvic alignment, strength, and flexibility in dancers. Twenty female dancers, 17 to 22 years of age, participated in a screening that consisted of an AlignaBod posture screen, upper abdominal manual muscle test, double leg lower test, straight leg raise test, and modified Thomas test. Participants were screened, engaged in dance classes for 14 weeks without Pilates, and screened a second time. They then attended a 2-hour pelvic alignment workshop followed by two weekly Pilates classes, one mat and one apparatus, for 14 weeks. The study concluded with a final screening and collection of qualitative data regarding participant perceptions of their experience. Analysis demonstrated a decrease in the number of postural misalignments with Pilates intervention compared to no significant change in total misalignments when taking dance classes only. The prevalence of forward head posture, knee hyperextension, and foot-ankle pronation or supination all decreased significantly. After participating in the Pilates intervention, the prevalence of iliotibial band and hamstring inflexibility decreased and lower abdominal muscle strength improved significantly. All participants reported they felt that Pilates improved their core stability, pelvic alignment, strength, and body awareness. This study suggests that Pilates, when added to dance training, can improve postural alignment, flexibility, and abdominal strength in dancers. Additionally, it is well tolerated by dancers, making it a potentially valuable cross-training tool."

  "date": "2019 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Assessment of, and advice about, spinal posture is common when people with spinal pain present to physiotherapists. Most descriptions regarding optimal spinal posture have been qualitative in nature.\nObjectives: To determine the beliefs of physiotherapists regarding optimal sitting and standing posture.\nDesign: Online survey.\nMethod: 544 Greek physiotherapists selected an optimal sitting (choice of seven) and standing (choice of five) posture, while providing justification for their choice.\nResults: Education regarding optimal sitting and standing posture was considered \"considerably\" or \"very\" important by 93.9% of participants. Three different sitting postures, and two different standing postures, were selected as the optimal posture by 97.5% and 98.2% of physiotherapists respectively. While this reflects a lack of complete consensus on optimal posture, the most commonly selected postures were all some variation of upright lordotic sitting, in contrast slouched spinal curves (sitting) or forward head posture (sitting and standing) almost never being selected as optimal. Interestingly, participants used similar arguments (e.g. natural curves, muscle activation) to justify their selection regardless of the spinal configuration of each selected posture.\nConclusions: These results reinforce previous data suggesting that upright lordotic sitting postures are considered optimal, despite a lack of strong evidence that any specific posture is linked to better health outcomes. While postural re-education may play a role in the management of spinal pain for some patients, awareness of such widespread and stereotypical beliefs regarding optimal posture may be useful in clinical assessment and management."

  "title": "Age-related changes in upper body contribution to braking forward locomotion in women",
  "date": "2019 Feb",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Gait termination is a transitory task that requires the lower body to produce braking forces and inhibit forward propulsion. However, it is still unknown whether the upper body plays an active role in braking of gait and whether this mechanism is impaired with ageing.\nResearch question: Do older women exhibit an impaired control of upper body segments during gait termination with respect to young women?\nMethods: Ten young and 10 older women performed three gait termination trials at comfortable speed while fixing the gaze on a visual target. A 3D motion analysis system was used to measure head, trunk and pelvis angular displacement and velocity, and estimate neck, waist and hip moments through Plug-in Gait modeling. Cross-correlation analysis of kinematic waveforms between paired adjacent segments (head-trunk and trunk-pelvis) was performed to investigate upper body coordination. Surface EMG activity of erector spinae (L3), sternocleidomastoid and neck extensor muscles was recorded. Statistics was carried out by MANOVA.\nResults: Older participants exhibited delayed peak extensor torques of neck, waist and hip compared to young participants, along with lower progression speed. Both groups showed a slight flexion of the trunk counteracted by a backward tilt of head and pelvis during braking. In addition, older women displayed a peculiar upper body coordination pattern, with the head coupling with trunk motion, as shown by cross-correlation. Older women displayed shorter lumbar erector spinae onset latency relative to last heel contact than young (16 ± 68 ms vs 92 ± 37 ms).\nSignificance: The upper body plays an active role in the braking of gait and this mechanism is impaired in older women. Moreover, the age-related coupling of head and trunk motion may produce an unbalancing effect on whole-body stability during the braking mechanism, thus leading to a higher risk of falls."

  "abstract": "This prospective randomized study assessed myocardial perfusion imaging with the high-sensitivity D.SPECT cadmium-zinc-telluride camera in a forward-leaning bikerlike position, which may potentially lower diaphragmatic attenuation and reduce breathing-related cardiac motion, in a manner comparable to the prone position proposed with other SPECT cameras. Methods: Patients referred for a stress-rest 99mTc-sestamibi protocol and positioned in the biker position, with the chest leaning forward on the D.SPECT camera-head at 35° from vertical, had an additional resting D.SPECT recording in the supine position (n = 40) or in the sitting position with the back rearward at 30° from vertical (n = 40). Segments with attenuation artifacts were defined as those with less than 65% uptake but with strictly normal contractility at gated SPECT and no defect reversibility from stress images. Results: The biker position was associated with lower heart-to-detector distances than the supine or sitting positions (both P < 0.001); lower cardiac motion amplitudes, assessed on panograms, than the supine position (P < 0.001); and fewer segments with attenuation artifacts than the supine position (on average, 1.10 ± 1.01 vs. 1.90 ± 1.74, P = 0.010) or the sitting position (0.75 ± 0.93 vs. 1.38 ± 1.60, P = 0.011). Conclusion: Myocardial perfusion images from D.SPECT are enhanced for patients positioned in a forward-leaning bikerlike position comparatively to sitting or supine positions, with a notably lower rate of attenuation artifacts."

We examined 20 people from the control group (age 18-25 years) and 70 patients of the same age with temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJD) complicated by dentoalveolar anomalies (distal bite - 27 persons, orthognathic with anomalies of the position of individual teeth - 18, deep - 16, mesial - 4, straight - 2, open - 2, cross - 1), before and after treatment with occlusive tires. Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) of the TMJ and photometric analysis were made to all those examined. The CBCT analysis was carried out according to the method developed by us, photometric analysis - with the help of the computer program developed by us. Thus, as a result of the study in patients with TMJD complicated by dentoalveolar anomalies were detected significant displacement of the mandible backwards and upwards, as well as according to the photometric analysis of the presence of postural disorders both in the frontal plane (the change of the head position relative to the shoulders and horizontally, impaired facial configuration in the form of an asymmetry of the arrangement of the lines of the eyes, the corners of the mouth and shoulders) and in the sagittal (the forward displacement of the head and the inclination of the vertical axis of the body forward).

  "title": "The effect of cervical spine subtypes on center of pressure parameters in a large asymptomatic young adult population",
  "date": "2019 Jan",
  "abstract": "Background: Recent research highlighted that non-lordotic subtypes are common within an asymptomatic population of young adults. The potential mechanisms responsible for the decreased postural control witnessed in healthy participants exhibiting non-lordotic cervical alignment are unclear.\nResearch question: Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare and contrast asymptomatic radiographically derived sagittal cervical alignment subtypes with Center of Pressure (CoP) parameters.\nMethods: In this cross-sectional study strict asymptomatic inclusion criteria were met by 150 of the original 182 volunteers. All radiographs were assessed using a multi-method subtype system with participants classified into lordotic and non-lordotic groups. Participants performed 90s narrow stance trials with their eyes closed whilst standing on both a firm surface (FS) and compliant surface (CS) (3 trials per surface). CoP parameters were recorded from a force platform sampling at 100 Hz. Nonparametric statistical tests were conducted to assess differences between groups for each surface type and to determine differences in CoP parameters between FS and CS types.\nResults: Significant differences were found between groups on both surfaces for the anterior to posterior range (FS: p = 0.013; CS: p = 0.023), total excursion (FS: p = 0.029; CS: p = 0.005) and mean velocity of total excursion (FS: p = 0.032; CS: p = 0.004).\nSignificance: Our data suggest that sagittal plane cervical alignment is a measure capable of distinguishing between the postural control of asymptomatic lordotic and non-lordotic young adult participants on both surfaces types. Furthermore, decreased postural control is present in asymptomatic participants across all non-lordotic subtypes and is not isolated exclusively to those with forward head posture. Consequently, future research endeavours should investigate the clinical significance of these non-lordotic findings in relation to both the potential for early cervical osseous degeneration and the transitional stages of non-specific pain sufferers from previously asymptomatic young adults."

One hundred forty-seven domestic college students (102 males and 45 females) and 72 foreign students (33 males and 39 females) were subjects in this study. Data collecting was performed by questionnaire and visual postural evaluation. For backpack shoulder dominance, higher incidences of genu varus (P=0.043) and lower incidence of leg length discrepancy (LLD) (P=0.001) were found in both shoulder carrier, while the incidence of lordosis was higher in left (P=0.001) and both (P=0.012) carrier in domestic students. The incidence of genu varus (P=0.022) and scoliosis (P=0.002) were significantly lower in both shoulder carrier in foreign students. For dominant arm, the incidence of forward head (P=0.001) and of lordosis (P=0.029) were significantly higher in left handedness both in domestic students and in foreign students. As the body mass index increases, the incidence of protruding abdomen (P=0.001) and lordosis (P=0.009) showed significant increase, but, the incidence of kyphosis (P=0.022) and scoliosis (P=0.001) decreased in domestic students, and same tendency for lordosis (P=0.001) and for scoliosis (P=0.001) in foreign students. As a whole, in domestic students, female students revealed significantly high (P=0.004) incidence of genu recurvatum compared to significantly low (P=0.022) incidence of LLD. However, no significant incidence difference found in foreign students. Male students showed significantly low incidence (P=0.001) of LLD and high incidence (P=0.014) of lordosis. In foreign students, female students also showed significantly low incidence (P=0.032) of LLD in foreign students compared to their counterparts."

  "abstract": "Background: Cervical spinal instability often leads to neck pain and forward head posture (FHP). To improve neck pain and FHP, both the suboccipital muscle inhibition (SMI) technique and cranio-cervical flexion exercise (CCFE) have been used. However, little is known regarding the validity of hamstring flexibility in neck pain subjects after CCFE as a treatment index, and comparison between the SMI technique and CCFE for neck pain treatment.\nObjective: This study aimed to determine the short-term effects of SMI technique and CCFE, which represent passive and active exercise programs, respectively, and whether these improve the straight leg raise (SLR) test results, popliteal angle (PA), cranio-vertebral angle (CVA), and cervical range of motion (CROM) and are equally effective in immediate enhancement of such measures in neck pain subjects.\nMethods: Twenty subjects with neck pain were randomly allocated to the SMI and CCFE groups (n= 10 each). The outcomes were evaluated via clinical evaluation and SLR, PA, CVA, and CROM measurement before and after intervention.\nResults: SLR test results, PA, CVA (sitting and standing), and CROM (flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and right and left rotations) after both interventions were significantly higher than those before the interventions (P< 0.05). The SLR test results (left), PA, and CVA (standing) after the SMI technique improved to levels similar to those observed after CCFE.\nConclusions: Both the SMI technique and CCFE improve SLR test results, PA, CVA, and CROM and are equally effective in immediate enhancement of the hamstring flexibility, CVA, and CROM in subjects with neck pain."

Participants used a simple home spinal traction device for 12 weeks, 10 min/d. Sagittal cervical radiographs and the SF36 health survey were obtained pre/post intervention and guideline compliance was recorded. Radiographic evaluation included typical measurements of sagittal cranio-cervical alignment and FHP (e.g., atlas plane line, vertical axis line, sagittal cranial angle, absolute rotation angle). Standard paired samples t tests, chi-squared, and effect size analyses were used to assess pre- and post-intervention changes.\nResults: Each of the key radiographic variables recorded significant moderate to very large positive changes as a result of the intervention. Similarly, Chi-squared analyses indicated that saggital cervical spine configuration tended to become more lordotic (P = 0.007), with four participants shifting from a kyphotic to a lordotic presentation. SF36 health survey data demonstrated mostly significant positive changes throughout all tested domains, and moderate positive changes were recorded across all radiographic cranio-cervical mesured paramenters (e.g., decreased FHP, increased cervical lordosis, and cranial extention). Participants indicated high level of protocol compliance.\nConclusion: This study has demonstrated that the unsupervised daily use of a simple home spinal traction device (Thoracic Pillow) proved effective in bringing positive plastic changes to the sagittal cranio-cervical alignment and reduction in symptoms in the tested population during a short intervention period.\nLevel of evidence: 3."

  "abstract": "In order to study the features of hemodynamics in the vertebral artery (VA), depending on the biomechanical disorders of the cervical spine (CS) and the musculoskeletal system as a whole 105 patients (53 females and 52 males, mean age - 38±5,9 years) having signs of the Vertebrobasilar insufficiency on the background of biomechanical disorders of the CS and the locomotor system as a whole were examined. The control group included 50 practically healthy persons (25 females and 25 males, mean age - 37±5,6 years). Physical examination included a clinical-neurological, vertebro-neurological examination (visual assessment of violations of statics and dynamics of the musculoskeletal system, measuring the craniovertebral angle (CVA) using a photogrammetric method, manual diagnostics for the detection of muscular-tonic syndromes and musculoskeletal dysfunction) and Doppler ultrasound of extra- and intracranial segments of VA. It was revealed the relationship between the violation of hemodynamics in vertebrobasilar system and pathobiomechanical changes of the musculoskeletal system in patients of young age. The leading pathogenetic role in the onset of hemodynamic disorders in VA belongs to a non-optimal static stereotype in the cervical region in the form of displacement of the regional center of gravity forward with the formation of a forward head position. It was revealed a positive correlation between the value of CVA and the degree of mobility of the craniovertebral transition by A. Stoddart (r = +0.79, p <0.05) and also - a negative correlation between CVA value and the level of blood flow reduction in VA during functional rotational tests (r=-0,69, p<0,05)."

  "abstract": "In 2018, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile introduced the halo frontal cockpit protection system into Formula 1. While extensive testing was conducted to confirm that the halo protects the driver from contact, the halo's effect on the driver during overtaking was not tested prior to its introduction. Here, we describe the effect of a halo-type structure on the neck muscle activity of one of the authors, a national-level amateur racing driver, during on-track simulations designed to practise overtaking. We found that the halo-type structure caused an increase in the rates of fatigue and workloads of sternocleidomastoid and cervical erector spinae. The results suggest that the driver adopted a forward and right laterally flexed head position, presumably to clear the central pillar from his visible field. This has the potential to increase compressive loading of the cervical spine and affect the ability to use visual cues during steering manoeuvres."

  "abstract": "[Purpose] This case presents the reduction of both forward head posture and thoracic hyperkyphosis in a young male with chronic back pain and headaches by a comprehensive posture rehabilitation program as a part of Chiropractic BioPhysics® methods. [Participant and Methods] A 32 year old male presented with constant pain and headaches for seven years since he was involved in a work related injury. He had seen five different MDs, undergone multiple imaging tests, and received multiple prescriptions, thirteen steroid injections and was recommended for a spine surgery that he had denied. He was on long-term disability. Upon comprehensive posture and spine assessment, the patient had exaggerated forward head translation and thoracic hyperkyphosis. The patient was treated 36 times over 13-weeks with cervical and thoracic extension exercises, traction, and manipulation. [Results] After treatment the patient reported dramatic improvement in symptoms as indicated on valid disability questionnaires and substantial improvements in posture. [Conclusion] Posture-related pain and disability is not often addressed in allopathic medicine but substantial posture improvements are achievable in short time periods as this case illustrates. Poor postures in young patients should be corrected to avoid long-term consequences. Radiography as used in spinal rehabilitation is safe and reliable."

FHP in standing, extensor and flexor muscles endurance and dimensions were assessed using digital photography, clinical tests and ultrasonographic imaging, respectively. The visual analog scale and neck disability index were also used to evaluate CNP patients' clinical characteristics.\nResults: Deep flexor (mean difference=0.06, 95% CI=0.02-0.11) and extensor muscles size (mean difference=0.07, 95% CI=0.01-0.12) were found to be significantly smaller in CNP patients.

FHP was neither different between the groups nor correlated with any of the dependent variables. Neither FHP nor endurance was correlated with pain/disability. Extensor endurance in both groups and flexor endurance in the asymptomatic group showed significant correlations with muscles size.\nConclusions: FHP was found neither different between groups nor correlated with muscle performance or CNP clinical characteristics. While cervical endurance was found lower in CNP patients, it did not show any association with pain/disability. The muscular size-endurance relationship seems to become more complex in the presence of NP. While deep muscles seem to be differentially affected in the presence of CNP, the alterations do not seem to be uniform in the flexor and extensor groups."

  "title": "Effect of Different Head-Neck Postures on the Respiratory Function in Healthy Males",
  "date": "2018 Jul 12",
  "abstract": "Normal respiration is a very intricate function that comprises mechanical as well as nonmechanical components. It is shown to be affected by various factors including age, lifestyle, disease, and change in posture. With the increased use of hand held devices, everyone is prone to poor sitting postures like forward head posture. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of assumed forward head posture and torticollis on the diaphragm muscle strength. A sample of 15 healthy males, aged 18-35 years, was recruited for this study. All subjects performed spirometry to measure the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), the forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio. SNIP was measured during upright sitting, induced forward head posture, and torticollis. Subject's mean age (SD) was 23(6) years. The SNIP score of the subjects during sitting with FHP was lower as compared to that during upright sitting. It decreased significantly during induced right torticollis position. This is the first study exploring the impact of different head and neck positions on respiratory function. Alteration of head and neck positions had an immediate negative impact on respiratory function. Clinicians should be prompted to assess respiratory function when assessing individuals with mal-posture."

  "date": "2018 Jul-Aug",
  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the results related to the effects of corrective exercises on postural variables in individuals with forward head posture (FHP).\nMethods: A systematic review of the electronic literature through February 2017 was independently performed by 2 investigators. The electronic databases searched included PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Meta-analyses were carried out for craniovertebral angle (CVA), cranial angle (CA), and pain intensity.\nResults: Seven randomized clinical trials comprising 627 participants met the study criteria. The between-groups pooled random odds ratios for CVA, CA, and pain were 6.7 (confidence interval [CI] = 2.53-17.9, P = .0005), 0.7 (CI = 0.43-1.2, P = .2), and 0.3 (95% CI = 0.13-0.42, P < .001), respectively. No publication bias was observed. Level 1a evidence (strong) indicates exercise training can effectively modify CVA, and level 1b evidence (moderate) indicates exercise may improve pain but not CA.\nConclusion: The findings suggest that therapeutic exercises may result in large changes in CVA and moderate improvement in neck pain in participants with FHP. The precise nature of the relationship between FHP and musculoskeletal pain, and improvements in both after therapeutic exercise, remains to be established."

  "date": "2019 May 24",
  "abstract": "Background/objectives: Since a high prevalence of back anomalies has been reported among subjects with crossbite, the aim was to assess the degree of back symmetry among subjects with (crossbite) and without (control) unilateral functional crossbite during the pre-pubertal growth phase.\nMethods: A group of 70 subjects (36 boys, 34 girls; 6.8 ± 1.2 years) in the primary or mixed dentition phase were included. Clinical assessment of head posture, shoulder, scapula and hip height were performed with the subject standing, and differences between the left and right side greater than 5 mm recorded. Asymmetry of the scapula and trunk prominence greater than 8 mm was recorded along with the prominence of thoracic and lumbar paravertebral musculature during the forward-bending test. Back symmetry was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively on colour deviation maps of superimposed mirrored three-dimensional back scans at a tolerance level of 2 mm.\nResults: No significant differences were observed between the groups regarding the frequency of clinically assessed back anomalies. The percentage of back symmetry was slightly lower in the crossbite than that in the control group (71.4 ± 13.3% and 79.2 ± 12.1%, respectively). A significant association (P < 0.05) was seen between scapula plane inclination (OR = 3.41) and scapula prominence inequalities (OR = 3.29) and unilateral functional crossbite, while hip height inequalities (OR = 0.94) were more frequent in the control group. No associations were detected between the side of crossbite and side of prominence of back parameters.\nLimitations: The use of different thresholds for clinical (5-8 mm) and three-dimensional (2 mm) symmetry assessment.\nConclusions: Although some degree of back asymmetry was detected in the crossbite group during the pre-pubertal growth phase, this asymmetry does not appear to be clinically relevant."

  "abstract": "Background: As one of the most common work-related musculoskeletal disorders and postural deviations, forward head posture (FHP), is considered to lead to muscle imbalance.\nObjectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the bilateral cross-sectional area (CSA) of the deep neck flexor muscles at rest and during five stages of the craniocervical flexion (CCF) test in individuals with FHP and the controls with normal head posture.\nMethods: Eighteen students with FHP and 18 controls with normal head posture, all females aged 18-35 years, participated in this study. Participants were categorized into two groups based on their craniovertebral angle. The CSA of the deep neck flexors was measured using ultrasonography while participants lay supine on the table with a pressure biofeedback unit placed under their necks in order to let the examiner measure the CSA of the muscles during rest and five stages of the CCF test including 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 mmHg of the pressure biofeedback unit.\nResults: A significant effect of contraction level was observed in both groups, indicating significant increases of the CSA of the deep neck flexors during contraction (F = 64.37, P < 0.001). No significant difference was evident for the CSA of the deep neck flexors between the groups, although the increase in the CSA of the deep neck flexors was up to 28 mmHg in the normal head posture group compared to 26 mmHg in the FHP group.\nConclusions: The results of the present study showed no significant difference between the performance of the deep neck flexors during the CCF test in FHP and normal head posture individuals, which challenge the common belief of the deep neck flexors weakness in individuals sustaining FHP."

Methods: Pre- and post-treatment CBCT scans for 30 female patients resolved of myofascial pain were reviewed by a blinded investigator using the modified hyoid triangle. Changes in dimensions of the hyoid triangle were analyzed with the t-test for paired comparisons. Results: Statistical analysis showed a drawing nearer of the chin to the third cervical vertebra (-2.0 mm, p = 0.026) and a release of the hyoid bone away from the floor of the mouth (1.5 mm, p = 0.011). Discussion: These findings suggest resolution of myofascial pain may correlate with decreased forward head posture and relaxation of suprahyoid musculature. The potential for change in oropharyngeal dimension and airway is evident."

Eighteen sessions of exercise were implemented. Craniovertebral angle (CVA) and cranial rotation angle (CRA) were measured to evaluate the change of FHP. The Gaitview AFA-50 (Alfoots Co, Korea) was used to measure the plantar pressure distribution.\nResults: The experimental group showed a larger increase in CVA than the control group (p< 0.05). Only the experimental group showed a significant decrease in CRA (p< 0.05).Both the anterior pressure and posterior pressure showed a significant improvement only in the experimental group (p< 0.05). The experimental group showed a larger increase in anterior/posterior ratio than the control group (p< 0.05).\nConclusions: Bodyblade improves the angle of FHP, thus positively affecting the average ratio of plantar pressure."

  "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study is to assess whether adding manual therapy to motor control exercises protocol with inspiratory muscle training (IMT) (combined intervention) resulted in a greater effect than IMT alone in enhancing maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) in the short term.\nMethods: This was a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Fifty-one healthy moderate smokers were randomized into 2 groups: (1) IMT and (2) combined intervention. All participants received 8 individual sessions, 2 per week during a 4-week period. The primary outcome (MIP) and the secondary outcome (pulmonary function, forward head posture, and thoracic kyphosis) were recorded at baseline and after the treatments.\nResults: There were differences between groups in change score for MIP (mean, 23.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.48-31.12), forward head posture (-1.57; 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.35), and thoracic kyphosis (-0.92; 95% CI: -1.74 to -0.1). The combined intervention revealed statistically significant differences for MIP (mean, -34; 95% CI: -39.12 to -28.88) and for postural measures (forward head posture 2.31; 95% CI: 1.45-3.16; thoracic kyphosis, 1.39; 95% CI: 0.8-1.97), whereas the IMT was only observed for MIP (mean, -10.2; 95% CI: -15.42 to -4.98). In addition, the intraclass correlation coefficient and minimal detectable change for MIP were 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.97, and 17.70, respectively.\nConclusion: Inspiratory muscle training protocol combined with manual therapy and motor control exercise had greater effect in enhancing MIP than did IMT in isolation in moderate smokers in the short term. In addition, both groups experienced changes in MIP but not in lung function."

  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of submandibular duct relocation (SMDR) in drooling children with neurological disorders.\nDesign: Prospective cohort study.\nSetting: Academic Outpatient Saliva Control Clinic.\nParticipants: Ninety-one children suffering from moderate to severe drooling.\nMain outcome measures: Direct observational drooling quotient (DQ; 0-100) and caretaker Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; 0-100). Secondary outcome measures were drooling severity (DS) and frequency rating scales.\nResults: The DQ at baseline, 8 and 32 weeks postoperatively was 26.4, 12.3 and 10.8, respectively. VAS score decreased from 80.1 at baseline to 28.3 and 37.0 at 8 and 32 weeks after surgery. Median DS at baseline, 8 and 32 weeks was 5, 3 and 4, whereas the drooling frequency median scores were 4, 2 and 2, respectively. Five children required prolonged intubation due to transient floor of the mouth swelling, two of whom developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia. Another child developed atelectasis with postoperative pneumonia. Two more children needed tube feeding because of postoperative eating difficulties for 3 days or suprapubic catheterisation for urinary retention. Children aged 12 years or older (OR = 3.41; P = 0.03) and those with adequate stability and position of the head (OR = 2.84; P = 0.09) appeared to benefit most from treatment.\nConclusions: Submandibular duct relocation combined with excision of the sublingual glands appears to be relatively safe and effective in diminishing visible drooling in children with neurological disorders, particularly in children aged 12 years and older and those without a forward head posture."

  "title": "Effect of Subject-Specific Vertebral Position and Head and Neck Size on Calculation of Spine Musculoskeletal Moments",
  "date": "2018 Nov",
  "abstract": "Spine musculoskeletal models used to estimate loads and displacements require many simplifying assumptions. We examined how assumptions about subject size and vertebral positions can affect the model outcomes. Head and neck models were developed to represent 30 subjects (15 males and 15 females) in neutral posture and in forward head postures adopted while using tablet computers. We examined the effects of (1) subject size-specific parameters for head mass and muscle strength; and (2) vertebral positions obtained either directly from X-ray or estimated from photographs. The outcome metrics were maximum neck extensor muscle moment, gravitational moment of the head, and gravitational demand, the ratio between gravitational moment and maximum muscle moment. The estimates of maximum muscle moment, gravitational moment and gravitational demand were significantly different when models included subject-specific vertebral positions. Outcome metrics of models that included subject-specific head and neck size were not significantly different from generic models on average, but they had significant sex differences. This work suggests that developing models from X-rays rather than photographs has a large effect on model predictions. Moreover, size-specific model parameters may be important to evaluate sex differences in neck musculoskeletal disorders."

  "abstract": "The baroreflex being a key modulator of cardiovascular control ensures adequate blood pressure regulation under orthostatic stress which otherwise may cause severe hypotension. Contrary to conventional baroreflex sensitivity indices derived across a-priori traditional frequency bands, the present study is aimed at proposing new indices for the assessment of baroreflex drive which follows active (supine to stand-up) and passive (supine to head-up tilt) postural changes. To achieve this, a novel system identification approach of principal dynamic modes (PDM) was utilized to extract data-adaptive frequency components of closed-loop interactions between beat-to-beat interval and systolic blood pressure recorded from 10 healthy humans. We observed that the gain of low-pass global PDM of cardiac arm (:feedback reflex loop, mediated by pressure sensors to adjust heart rate in response to arterial blood pressure), and 0.2 Hz global PDM of mechanical arm (:feed-forward pathways, originating changes in arterial blood pressure in response to heart rate variations) may function as potential markers to distinguish active and passive orthostatic tests in healthy subjects."

[Subjects and Methods] A sample of 30 patients with forward head posture were recruited and participated in an intervention for 30 minutes a day, three times per week for 4 weeks. Fifteen patients were assigned to the scapular stabilization exercise group and the remaining 15 were assigned to the neck stabilization exercise group. Before the intervention, the craniovertebral angle (CVA), cranial rotation angle (CRA), and muscle activity of the muscles around the neck were measured. Four weeks later, these 3 factors were re-measured and analyzed. [Results] Within-group changes in CVA and CRA were observed in both groups and were statistically significant. Only the CVA group had a statistically significant between-group differences. Within-group changes in muscular activity were significant differences in all groups. Between groups, the lower back trapezius and serratus anterior showed statistically significant differences. [Conclusion] Scapular stabilization brought about improvement in posture through activation of the neck muscles, the lower trapezius, and the serratus anterior. Therefore, the intervention has a positive effect on neck alignment by reducing the compensatory movements of the muscles involved in forward head posture. Structural changes are observed."

  "date": "2018 Aug",
  "abstract": "The highly complex proprioceptive system provides neuromuscular control of the mobile cervical spine. Static neck flexion can induce the elongation of posterior tissues and altered afferent input from the mechanoreceptors. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of prolonged static neck flexion on neck proprioception and anticipatory postural adjustments. Thirty-eight healthy participants (20 females and 18 males) between the ages of 20-35 years with no history of neck, low back, and shoulder pain enrolled in this study. Neck proprioception and anticipatory muscle activity were tested before and after 10-min static neck flexion. For assessment of neck proprioception, each participant was asked to perform 10 trials of the cervicocephalic relocation test to the neutral head position after active neck rotation to the left and right sides. Anticipatory postural adjustments were evaluated during a rapid arm flexion test. Following the flexion, the absolute and variable errors in head repositioning significantly increased (p < 0.05). The results also showed that there was a significant delay in the onset of myoelectric activity of the cervical erector spinae muscles after flexion (p = 0.001). The results of this study suggested that a 10-min static flexion can lead to changes in the neck proprioception and feed-forward control due to mechanical and neuromuscular changes in the viscoelastic cervical spine structures. These changes in sensory-motor control may be a risk factor for neck pain and injury."

  "abstract": "Objective: To review the clinical and radiographic characteristics of orthostatic headache following suboccipital craniectomy without CSF leak after encountering 2 such patients.\nBackground: Orthostatic headache may occur without CSF leak, suggesting alternative mechanisms for postural head pain in some patients.\nMethods: Patients who were referred for orthostatic headache and suspected CSF leak within 1 year after suboccipital craniectomy but who had negative post-operative head and spine MRI, normal radioisotope cisternography, and normal or elevated CSF opening pressure were identified and their medical records reviewed.\nResults: Two patients satisfied all inclusion criteria. One underwent suboccipital craniectomy for treatment of Chiari malformation type I in adolescence; the same surgical approach was used to resect a posterior fossa meningioma in the second. Both patients had non-orthostatic headache before surgery and newly developed orthostatic headache later. Delay from surgery to orthostatic headache onset was variable (2-9 months). Headaches were predominantly occipital and pressure-like, worsened by upright posture, bending forward, and exertion. MRI consistently showed adequate decompression of the posterior fossa. Epidural blood patches were unhelpful in the one patient in whom they were performed.\nConclusions: Orthostatic headaches may develop after suboccipital craniectomy in the absence of CSF leak. Possible mechanisms include (1) scarring of the dura in the posterior fossa that leads to compensatory increased distensibility of lumbar dura and (2) sensitization of mechanosensitive dural nociceptors from altered skull-dura apposition."

Demographic data, anthropometric data, FHP, and PPTs were collected for both groups. In addition, pain characteristics, pain catastrophizing, and fear of movement were assessed for participants with neck pain. FHP was characterized by the angle between C7, the tragus of the ear, and the horizontal line. Correlation analysis and multivariate regression analysis were conducted.\nResults: Participants with subclinical neck pain showed significantly lower PPTs than participants without neck pain (p < .05), but similar FHP (p > .05). No significant association was found between FHP and PPTs in the asymptomatic group. In the group of participants with subclinical neck pain, PPTs at the right trapezius and neck pain duration explained 19% of the variance of FHP (R2 = 0.23; adjusted R2 = 0.19; p < .05).\nConclusion: This study suggests that FHP is not associated with PPTs in asymptomatic university students. In university students with subclinical neck pain, increased FHP was associated with right trapezius hypoalgesia and with neck pain of shorter duration. These findings are in contrast with current assumptions on the association between neck pain and FHP."

Of the tablet reading positions, the reclined position had the lowest gravitational moment arm (5.2 ± 2.3 cm) and a skull angle closest to neutral (-9.4 ± 11.4°), while exhibiting the largest extension in the C1-C2 joint (34.4 ± 9.1°). Altering trunk position when reading a tablet could reduce the load required to support the head, but could put the head in a more forward head posture, stretch the cervical extensor muscles, and potentially result in pain."

  "abstract": "Purpose: Among computer workers, visual complaints, and neck pain are highly prevalent. This study explores how occupational simulated stressors during computer work, like glare and psychosocial stress, affect physiological responses in young females with normal vision.\nMethods: The study was a within-subject laboratory experiment with a counterbalanced, repeated design. Forty-three females performed four 10-min computer-work sessions with different stress exposures: (1) minimal stress; (2) visual stress (direct glare); (3) psychological stress; and (4) combined visual and psychological stress. Muscle activity and muscle blood flow in trapezius, muscle blood flow in orbicularis oculi, heart rate, blood pressure, blink rate and postural angles were continuously recorded. Immediately after each computer-work session, fixation disparity was measured and a questionnaire regarding perceived workstation lighting and stress was completed.\nResults: Exposure to direct glare resulted in increased trapezius muscle blood flow, increased blink rate, and forward bending of the head. Psychological stress induced a transient increase in trapezius muscle activity and a more forward-bent posture. Bending forward towards the computer screen was correlated with higher productivity (reading speed), indicating a concentration or stress response. Forward bent posture was also associated with changes in fixation disparity. Furthermore, during computer work per se, trapezius muscle activity and blood flow, orbicularis oculi muscle blood flow, and heart rate were increased compared to rest.\nConclusions: Exposure to glare and psychological stress during computer work were shown to influence the trapezius muscle, posture, and blink rate in young, healthy females with normal binocular vision, but in different ways. Accordingly, both visual and psychological factors must be taken into account when optimizing computer workstations to reduce physiological responses that may cause excessive eyestrain and musculoskeletal load."

Nerve conductions of bilateral median, radial, ulnar and medial antebrachial cutaneous (MAC) nerves were examined in all patients included in the study. The most significant nerve conduction differences in moderate-to-severe FHP patients were a decrease in the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of median nerves, a decrease in the SNAP amplitude of ulnar nerves, a delay in the F response latency of ulnar nerves and prolongation in the SNAP latency of the MAC nerve. FHP makes patients more prone to peripheral entrapments."

The postural measures were further improved after one year of mostly home-care. [Conclusion] The cervical spine alignment may be an important biomarker for those with dizziness. The correction of cervical lordosis may be an essential requirement for superior clinical outcomes for those with posttraumatic dizziness."

  "title": "Scapular Upward Rotator Morphologic Characteristics in Individuals With and Without Forward Head Posture: A Case-Control Study",
  "date": "2019 Feb",
  "abstract": "Objectives: There are several reports suggesting that forward head posture contributes to alterations in scapular kinematics and muscle activity, leading to the development of shoulder problems. Currently, it is unknown whether forward head posture alters the thickness of the scapular muscles. The aim of this study was to compare the thickness of the serratus anterior and upper and lower trapezius muscles at rest and during loaded isometric contractions in individuals with and without forward head posture.\nMethods: Twenty individuals with forward head posture and 20 individuals with normal head posture participated in this case-control study. Three separate ultrasound images of the serratus anterior and upper and lower trapezius muscles were captured under 2 randomized conditions: at rest and during a loaded isometric contraction.\nResults: The thickness of each muscle significantly increased from rest to the loaded isometric contraction (P < .001). The only difference between the groups was that the thickness of the serratus anterior muscle at rest in the normal-posture group was larger than that in the forward-posture group (P = .01).\nConclusions: Forward head posture appears to be related to atrophy of the serratus anterior muscle, which may contribute to the development of shoulder problems. Further research is required to identify more about the association of forward head posture with the imbalance of shoulder girdle muscles and the impact of head posture on upper quadrant pain."

  "date": "2018",
  "abstract": "Background: The sitting in an awkward posture for a prolonged time may lead to spinal or musculoskeletal disease. It is important to investigate the joint loads at spine while sitting.\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the joint moment and antero-posterior (AP) reaction force at cervico-thoracic and lumbosacral joint for various sitting postures.\nMethods: Twenty healthy males participated in this study. Six sitting postures were defined from three spinal curvatures (slump, flat, and lordosis) and two arm postures (arms-on-chest and arms-forward). Kinematic and kinetic data were measured in six sitting postures from which joint moment and AP reaction force were calculated by inverse dynamics.\nResults: In the cervico-thoracic joint, joint moment and AP reaction force were greater in slump than the flat and lordosis postures (p< 0.001) and also in arms-forward posture compared to arms-on-chest posture. In the lumbosacral joint, joint moment and AP reaction force were greater in slump than flat and lordotic posture (p< 0.001) but there was no difference between different arm postures. The joint loads (moment and AP reaction force) at the cervico-thoriacic joint were closely related to the head flexion angle (r> 0.86) while those at the lumbosacral joint were correlated to the trunk flexion angle (r> 0.77). In slump posture, the joint moments were close to or over the extreme of the daily life such as sit-to-stand and walking. Consequently, if the slump is continued for a long time, it may cause pain and diseases at the cervico-thoracic and lumbosacral joints.\nConclusions: The results of the study indicated that the lordosis or flat would be better spinal postures. Also, keeping arms close to body would be desirable to reduce joint loads."

  "title": "A comparison of economy and sagittal plane trunk movements among back-, back/front- and head-loading",
  "date": "2018 Sep",
  "abstract": "It has been suggested that freedom of movement in the trunk could influence load carriage economy. This study aimed to compare the economy and sagittal plane trunk movements associated with three load carriage methods that constrain posture differently. Eighteen females walked at 3 km.h-1 with loads of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 20 kg carried on the back, back/front and head. Load carriage economy was assessed using the Extra Load Index (ELI). Change in sagittal plane trunk forward lean and trunk angle excursion from unloaded to loaded walking were assessed. Results show no difference in economy between methods (p = .483), despite differences in the change in trunk forward lean (p = .001) and trunk angle excursion (p = .021) from unloaded to loaded walking. We conclude that economy is not different among the three methods of load carriage, despite significant differences in sagittal plane trunk movements. Practitioner summary: This article shows, based on mean data, that there is no difference in economy among back, back/front and head-loading, despite differences in trunk movement. It is possible a combination of factors align to influence individual economy, rather than a single set of factors, applicable to all individuals for each method."

  "date": "2018 Jul",
  "abstract": "The modulation of perturbation-evoked potential (PEP) N1 as a function of different biomechanical characteristics of perturbation has been investigated before. However, it remains unknown whether the PEP N1 modulation contributes to the shaping of the functional postural response. To improve this understanding, we examined the modulation of functional postural response in relation to the PEP N1 response in ten healthy young subjects during unpredictable perturbations to their upright stance-translations of the support surface in a forward or backward direction at two different amplitudes of constant speed. Using independent components from the fronto-central region, obtained from subject-specific head models created from the MRI, our results show that the latency of onset of the functional postural response after the PEP N1 response was faster for forward than backward perturbations at a constant speed but was not affected by the speed of perturbation. Further, our results reinforce some of the previous findings that suggested that the N1 peak amplitude and peak latency are both modulated by the speed of perturbation but not by the direction of the perturbation. Our results improve the understanding of the relation between characteristics of perturbation and the neurophysiology of reactive balance control and may have implications for the design of brain-machine interfaces for populations with a higher risk of falls."

  "date": "2018 Jul",
  "abstract": "Development of trunk and head supportive devices for children with neuromuscular disorders requires detailed information about pelvis, trunk and head movement in interaction with upper extremity movement, as these are crucial for daily activities when seated in a wheelchair. Twenty-five healthy subjects (6-20 years old) were included to obtain insight in the physiological interactions between these segments and to assess maturation effects. Subjects performed a maximum range of trunk and head movement tasks and several daily tasks, including forward and lateral reaching. Movements of the arms, head, pelvis, and sub-sections of the trunk were recorded with an optical motion capture system. The range of motion of each segment was calculated. Contributions of individual trunk segments to the range of trunk motion varied with movement direction and therefore with the task performed. Movement of pelvis and all trunk segments in the sagittal plane increased significantly with reaching height, distance and object weight when reaching forward and lateral. Trunk movement in reaching decreased with age. Head movement was opposite to trunk movement in the sagittal (> 50% of the subjects) and transverse planes (> 75% of the subjects) and was variable in the frontal plane in most tasks. Both trunk and head movement onsets were earlier compared to arm movement onset. These results provide insight in the role of the upper body in arm tasks in young subjects and can be used for the design of trunk and head supportive devices for children with neuromuscular disorders."

  "abstract": "Study design: A cross-sectional study.\nObjectives: The main goal of the study was to analyze posture of Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) in women compared with healthy subjects to establish if posture assessment could be useful to characterize the syndrome. Secondarily, we explored the impact of sedentary behavior on trunk posture.\nSummary of background data: Pain has been associated with poor static postures, however there is little information on the effect of FMS, which is characterized by widespread pain, on trunk posture.\nMethods: One hundred eighteen women with FMS and 110 healthy counterparts participated in this study, in which trunk posture was assessed. The thoracic kyphosis, forward head position, and shoulder position (basal and maximum protraction) were measured. Further, maximum shoulder protraction and the ability to maintain the cervical and thoracic angle were assessed. To compare the differences in posture depending on the grouping, an independent Student t test was conducted. To analyze the differences between groups in the ability to maintain the position over a period of time and the differences in posture depending on more or less active lifestyles, two multivariate analysis of variance were performed.\nResults: The results showed a significantly larger thoracic kyphosis, baseline shoulder protraction and lower craniovertebral angle and maximum protraction in FMG compared with CG (P < 0.05). FMG subjects exhibited an impaired ability to maintain the cervical and thoracic angles, as this varied throughout the test, unlike those of their counterparts. A sedentary lifestyle did not affect trunk posture in the FMS participants.\nConclusion: FMS female population present an altered trunk posture and an inability to maintain trunk position. Since this does not appear to be influenced by a more or less active lifestyle, specific treatment programs are needed to manage this clinical condition.\nLevel of evidence: 2."

Outcome variables collected included: balance ability (Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test and Timed Up an Go Test) and posture (photogrammetry and Spinal Mouse).\nResults: Significant differences were found in all Mini Best Test subscales: total (P < 0.001), anticipatory (P = 0.002), reactive postural control (P < 0.001), sensory orientation (P < 0.001), and dynamic gait (P < 0.001), and all Timed Up and Go test subscales: alone (P < 0.001), with manual (P = 0.002) and cognitive task (P = 0.030). Significant differences were also found on spinal cervical angles with a forward head posture in women with CPP; global spine alignment exhibited more deviation in the women with CPP (P < 0.001); and a higher percentage of women with CPP (58%) presented with increased thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. Cohen's d was used to calculate the effect size. Some subscales of balance and posture tests showed a large effect size (d ≥0.8), indicating a more consistent result.\nConclusions: Women with CPP presented poor balance including anticipatory, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, dynamic gait, and dual task-related conditions. Posture showed higher values on the dorsal angle and lower sacral inclination, less spine alignment, and a more prevalent posture with increased kyphosis and lumbar lordosis."

  "date": "2018 Jun",
  "abstract": "Dropped head syndrome (DHS) is characterized by a chin-on-chest deformity, which can severely interfere with forward vision and impair activities of daily living. A standardized treatment strategy for DHS has not been established. To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing the efficacy of gait training using a hybrid assistive limb (HAL) for DHS. A 75-year-old man showed apparent head drop in a standing position, resulting in passively reducible chin-on-chest deformity. A radiograph image showed apparent cervical kyphosis. Center of gravity of the head (CGH)-C7 SVA was +115 mm, CL was -40°, and T1S 39°. The patient underwent a treatment program using HAL, in which gait training was mainly performed, 60 min a day, 5 days a week for 2 weeks (10 sessions). After 2-3 sessions, dropped head started to attenuate. At the end of 10 sessions, the patient was able to walk with normal posture and radiograph images showed cervical kyphosis dramatically decreased because of HAL training. CGH-C7 SVA was 42 mm, CL was -1.7°, and T1S was 30°. Three months' outpatient follow-up revealed a slight deterioration of cervical alignment. However, the patient was able to maintain a better cervical alignment than before HAL training and keep walking with forward vision. There were no complications in any HAL treatment session. In conclusion, gait training using HAL is an option for treatment of DHS in addition to previously reported neck extensor muscle training."

  "title": "A preliminary study of human model head and neck response to frontal loading in nontraditional occupant seating configurations",
  "date": "2018 Feb 28",
  "abstract": "Objective: Computational human body models (HBMs) are nominally omnidirectional surrogates given their structural basis in human anatomy. As a result, such models are well suited for studies related to occupant safety in anticipated highly automated vehicles (HAVs). We utilize a well-validated HBM to study the head and neck kinematics in simulations of nontraditional occupant seating configurations.\nMethods: The GHBMC M50-O v. 4.4 HBM was gravity settled into a generic seat buck and situated in a seated posture. The model was simulated in angular increments of 15 degrees clockwise from forward facing to rear facing. A pulse of 17.0 kph (NASS median) was used in each to simulate a frontal impact for each of the 13 seating configurations. Belt anchor points were rotated with the seat; the airbag was appropriately powered based on delta-V, and was not used in rear-facing orientations. Neck forces and moments were calculated.\nResults: The 30-degree oblique case was found to result in the maximum neck load and sagittal moment, and thus Neck Injury Criteria (NIJ). Neck loads were minimized in the rear facing condition. The moments and loads, however, were greatest in the lateral seating configuration for these frontal crash simulations.\nConclusions: In a recent policy statement on HAVs, the NHTSA indicated that vehicle manufacturers will be expected to provide countermeasures that will fully protect occupants given any planned seating or interior configurations. Furthermore, the agency indicated that virtual tests using human models could be used to demonstrate such efficacy. While the results presented are only appropriate for comparison within this study, they do indicate that human models provide reasonable biomechanical data for nontraditional occupant seating arrangements."

  "date": "2018 Feb 28",
  "abstract": "Objective: The research objective was to quantify the influence of child restraint lower attachment method on head kinematics, head impact potential, and head, neck, and thorax injury metrics for a child occupant secured in a forward-facing child restraint system (FFCRS) in oblique side impacts.\nMethods: Fifteen sled tests were conducted with a Q3s seated in an FFCRS secured to the center position on a production small SUV bench seat. Three lower attachment methods were evaluated: rigid ISOFIX, a flexible single loop lower anchors and tethers for children (LATCH) webbing routed through the vehicle belt path of the FFCRS, and dual flexible LATCH webbing attachments on either side of the FFCRS. All were tested with and without a tether with one repeat test in each test condition. The same model FFCRS was used for all tests; only the attachment method varied. The vehicle bench seat was fixed on the sled carriage at 80° (from full frontal). The input pulse was the proposed FMVSS 213 side impact pulse scaled to a 35 km/h delta-v. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of lower attachment and tether use on 3 outcome metrics: lateral head excursion, neck tension, and neck lateral bending. Data included anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD) head excursions, head linear accelerations and angular velocities, neck loads and moments, thoracic accelerations, lateral chest deflections, lower anchor loads, and tether webbing loads. ATD head kinematics were collected from 3-dimensional motion capture cameras.\nResults: Results demonstrated a reduction in injury measures with the rigid ISOFIX and dual webbing attachment compared to the single webbing attachment with decreased lateral head excursions (331, 356, and 441 mm for the rigid ISOFIX, dual webbing, and single webbing systems, respectively, P <.0001), neck tension (1.4, 1.6, and 2.2 kN, P <.01), and neck lateral bending (31.8, 38.7, and 38.0 Nm, P =.002). The tether had a greater influence on lateral head excursion for the FFCRS with flexible webbing attachments than those with the rigid attachment, with the tether forces being highest with the single webbing attachment. Lateral head excursions were significantly lower and lateral neck bending moments were significantly higher with tether use (P <.0001) across all lower attachments. The effect of tether on neck tension was mixed, only showing an increased effect with the rigid ISOFIX system.\nConclusion: The CRS lower attachment system influenced occupant kinetics. The results indicate that CRS attached to the vehicle via rigid and dual webbing systems exhibit improved kinematics by reducing the rotation and tipping seen with the single webbing attachment. This leads to reduced lateral head excursions and neck tension values. The advantages of the tether in reducing lateral head excursion in side impacts are most pronounced with the flexible webbing attachments. With tether use low in the United States, a dual webbing type FFCRS attachment system may be a better attachment method than single webbing and provide a simpler engineering solution than rigid ISOFIX attachment."

  "date": "2018 Feb 28",
  "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of frontal and oblique crashes when positioning a Hybrid III (HIII) 6-year-old child anthropometric test device (ATD) using observed child passenger postures from a naturalistic driving study (NDS).\nMethods: Five positions for booster-seated children aged 4-7 years were selected, including one reference position according to the FMVSS 213 ATD seating protocol and 4 based on real-world observed child passenger postures from an NDS including 2 user positions with forward tilting torso and 2 that combined both forward and lateral inboard tilting of the torso. Seventeen sled tests were conducted in a mid-sized vehicle body at 64 km/h (European New Car Assessment Programme [Euro NCAP] Offset Deformable Barrier [ODB] pulse), in full frontal and oblique (15°) crash directions. The rear-seated HIII 6-year-old child ATD was restrained on a high-back booster seat. In 10 tests, the booster seat was also attached with a top tether. In the oblique tests, the ATD was positioned on the far side. Three camera views and ATD responses (head, neck, and chest) were analyzed.\nResults: The shoulder belt slipped off the shoulder in all ATD positions in the oblique test configuration. In full frontal tests, the shoulder belt stayed on the shoulder in 3 out of 9 tests. Head acceleration and neck tension were decreased in the forward leaning positions; however, the total head excursion increased up to 210 mm compared to te reference position, due to belt slip-off and initial forward leaning position.\nConclusions: These results suggest that real-world child passenger postures may contribute to shoulder belt slip-off and increased head excursion, thus increasing the risk of head injury. Restraint system development needs to include a wider range of sitting postures that children may choose, in addition to the specified postures of ATDs in seating test protocols, to ensure robust performance across diverse use cases. In addition, these tests revealed that the child ATD is limited in its ability to mimic real-world child passenger postures. There is a need to develop child human body models that may offer greater flexibility for these types of crash evaluations."

  "date": "2018 May",
  "abstract": "Sensory information conveyed along afferent fibers from muscle and joint proprioceptors play an important role in the control of posture and gait in humans. In particular, proprioceptive information from the neck is fundamental in supplying the central nervous system with information about the orientation and movement of the head relative to the rest of the body. The previous studies have confirmed that proprioceptive afferences originating from the neck region, evoked via muscle vibration, lead to strong body-orienting effects during static conditions (e.g., leaning of the body forwards or backwards, depending on location of vibration). However, it is not yet certain in humans, whether the somatosensory receptors located in the deep skin (cutaneous mechanoreceptors) have a substantive contribution to postural control, as vibratory stimulation encompasses the receptive field of all the somatosensory receptors from the skin to the muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the postural effect of cutaneous mechanoreceptor afferences using electro-tactile stimulation applied to the neck. Ten healthy volunteers (8M, 2F) were evaluated. The average position of their centre of foot pressure (CoP) was acquired before, during, and after a subtle electro-tactile stimulation over their posterior neck (mean ± SD = 5.1 ± 2.3 mA at 100 Hz-140% of the perception threshold) during upright stance with their eyes closed. The electro-tactile stimulation led to a body-orienting effect with the subjects consistently leaning forward. An average shift of the CoP of 12.1 ± 11.9 mm (mean ± SD) was reported, which significantly (p < 0.05) differed from its average position under a control condition (no stimulation). These results indicate that cutaneous mechanoreceptive inflow from the neck is integrated to control stance. The findings are relevant for the exploitation of electro-tactile stimulation for rehabilitation interventions where induced anteropulsion of the body is desired."

[Subject and Methods] A 52-year-old male mechanic presented with chronic neck pain, unilateral paresthesia along the C5 and C6 dermatome distributions and diminished unilateral grip strength for 12 years following a C5-C6 cervical discectomy and fusion. Outcome measures included the neck disability index, the numerical pain rating scale, and the Zebris cervical range of motion system. Radiographs and computerized posture analysis revealed excessive forward head posture. Initial traditional 'symptom-relief' chiropractic rehabilitation was provided, followed by CBP® structural rehabilitation of head and neck posture with a 2.5 year follow-up. [Results] The initial traditional chiropractic rehabilitation did not improve posture or disability scores. CBP methods resulted in radiograph-verified postural alignment improvements corresponding with clinically significant improvements in the patient's neurologic condition, pain and disability scores. These results were maintained at a 2.5 year follow-up with minimal treatment. [Conclusion] Patients with post-surgical axial symptoms and/or radicular complaints should be screened for altered cervical alignment and anterior head translation. Future studies should attempt to duplicate these positive results in a trial with long-term follow-up."

  "title": "Praying Sitting Position for Pineal Region Surgery: An Efficient Variant of a Classic Position in Neurosurgery",
  "date": "2018 May",
  "abstract": "Background: The sitting position has lost favor among neurosurgeons partly owing to assumptions of increased complications, such as venous air embolisms and hemodynamic disturbances. Moreover, the surgeon must assume a tiring posture. We describe our protocol for the \"praying position\" for pineal region surgery; this variant may reduce some of the risks of the sitting position, while providing a more ergonomic surgical position.\nMethods: A retrospective review of 56 pineal lesions operated on using the praying position between January 2008 and October 2015 was performed. The praying position is a steeper sitting position with the upper torso and the head bent forward and downward. The patient's head is tilted about 30° making the tentorium almost horizontal, thus providing a good viewing angle. G-suit trousers or elastic bandages around the lower extremities are always used.\nResults: Complete lesion removal was achieved in 52 cases; subtotal removal was achieved in 4. Venous air embolism associated with persistent hemodynamic changes was nonexistent in this series. When venous air embolism was suspected, an immediate reaction based on good teamwork was imperative. No cervical spine cord injury or peripheral nerve damage was reported. The microsurgical time was <45 minutes in most of the cases. Postoperative pneumocephalus was detected in all patients, but no case required surgical treatment.\nConclusions: A protocolized praying position that includes proper teamwork management may provide a simple, fast, and safe approach for proper placement of the patient for pineal region surgery."

  "abstract": "Background: The forward head rounded shoulder (FHRS) sitting posture has been associated with decreased shoulder complex muscle strength and function. Upon clinical observation, the adverse effects of the FHRS sitting posture on shoulder complex isometric muscle strength is also present when testing controls for scapular position.\nHypothesis/purpose: The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of various sitting postures on shoulder external rotator muscle isometric strength when the strength testing controls for scapular position.\nStudy design: A cohort study, with subjects serving as their own controls.\nMethods: One hundred subjects ages 20-26 participated in the study. Each subject was placed in a neutral cervical sitting (NCS) posture which was maintained for five minutes after which the strength of the dominant shoulder external rotators was immediately tested with the glenohumeral joint in the neutral position using a Micro-FET3 Hand Held Muscle Testing Dynamometer (HHMTD). Each subject was returned to the NCS posture for subsequent external rotator strength testing after five minutes in a FHRS sitting posture, five additional minutes in the NCS posture and five minutes in a retracted cervical sitting (RCS) posture resulting in each subjects' external rotator strength being tested on four occasions. Subjects were randomized for order between the FHRS and RCS postures.\nResults: Mean strength values for each condition were normalized to the mean strength value for the 1st NCS condition for each subject. A statistically significant decline in shoulder external rotator strength following the FHRS sitting posture occurred compared to the appropriate postural conditions (p<.05). A frequency analysis revealed that 36% of the subjects demonstrated greater than 10% decline in external rotator strength following five minutes in the FHRS sitting posture. The average percentage of strength decline in those with greater than a 10% reduction in external rotator strength was 19%. Sixty-four percent of the subjects experienced less than a 10% decline in shoulder external rotator strength in response to the FHRS sitting posture.\nConclusion: Shoulder external rotator strength declined 8% following five minutes in the FHRS sitting posture. A sub-population of 36% demonstrated an average decline of 19% in shoulder external rotator strength following five minutes in the FHRS sitting posture. The strength decline appears to resolve over the short-term by returning to the NCS posture.\nLevel of evidence: Level III."

  "title": "Prominent exostosis projecting from the occipital squama more substantial and prevalent in young adult than older age groups",
  "date": "2018 Feb 20",
  "abstract": "Recently we reported the development of prominent exostosis young adults' skulls (41%; 10-31 mm) emanating from the external occipital protuberance (EOP). These findings contrast existing reports that large enthesophytes are not seen in young adults. Here we show that a combination sex, the degree of forward head protraction (FHP) and age predicted the presence of enlarged EOP (EEOP) (n = 1200, age 18-86). While being a male and increased FHP had a positive effect on prominent exostosis, paradoxically, increase in age was linked to a decrease in enthesophyte size. Our latter findings provide a conundrum, as the frequency and severity of degenerative skeletal features in humans are associated typically with aging. Our findings and the literature provide evidence that mechanical load plays a vital role in the development and maintenance of the enthesis (insertion) and draws a direct link between aberrant loading of the enthesis and related pathologies. We hypothesize EEOP may be linked to sustained aberrant postures associated with the emergence and extensive use of hand-held contemporary technologies, such as smartphones and tablets. Our findings raise a concern about the future musculoskeletal health of the young adult population and reinforce the need for prevention intervention through posture improvement education."

  "title": "Large enthesophytes in teenage skulls: Mechanical, inflammatory and genetic considerations",
  "date": "2018 Mar",
  "abstract": "Background: The literature implies that large enthesophytes are exclusive to genetically predisposed individuals and to Spondyloarthropathies sufferers. Accordingly, the aim of this investigation and report was to assess the involvement of genetic predisposition, inflammatory and/or mechanical influences in the development of large enthesophytes in a sample population of teenagers presenting with large enthesophytes emanating from the external occipital protuberance.\nMethods: Analysis was based on four teenage males (13-16 year-old) possessing 14.5-30.5 mm enthesophytes projecting from the external occipital protuberance. This study included assessment of radiographs, MRI scans, blood-work, history, the SF-36 health survey, and the comparison of these data with the relevant literature to describe the interrelationships between the presence of enlarged external occipital protuberance, forward head protraction, active inflammation and/or genetic factors.\nFindings: Known genetic markers (e.g. HLA-B27) were not detected by allele-specific primers and both ESR and CRP tests were negative. Additionally, MRI analyses failed to detect active localised inflammation at the external occipital protuberance and surrounding structures. The health survey yielded normal parameters for all participants. All participants displayed significantly large Forward Head Protraction values (>40 mm), and interviews with participants and their parents indicated that concerns related to posture were prevalent since early childhood.\nInterpretation: This report suggests that mechanical load has an important role in enthesophyte development, irrespective the involvement of inflammatory or genetic factors."

  "title": "Head position affects the direction of occlusal force during tapping movement",
  "date": "2018 May",
  "abstract": "Despite numerous reports describing the relationship between head position and mandibular movement in human subjects, the direction and magnitude of force at the occlusal contacts have not been investigated in relation to head position. The objective was to investigate the effect of head position on the direction of occlusal force while subjects performed a tapping movement. Twenty-three healthy adult subjects were asked to sit on a chair with their back upright and to perform 15 tapping movements in five different head positions: natural head position (control); forward; backward; and right and left rolled. The direction and magnitude of force were measured using a small triaxial force sensor. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Bonferroni test were used to compare head positions in each angle of the anteroposterior axis direction and the lateral axis direction with respect to the superior axis. The force element in the anteroposterior axis shifted to the forward direction in the head position pitched backward, compared with control, pitched forward and rolled left positions (P = .02, <.01 and <.01, respectively). The force direction in the lateral axis with the head position rolled to the right or left shifted to the left and right directions, respectively, compared with those in the other positions (P < .05). Results of this study suggest that the head should be maintained in a position in which a stable tapping movement can be performed in a relaxed position without anteroposterior and lateral loading."

  "title": "[Correlation analysis between position of head, cervical curvature classification and balance of cervical spine through lateral plain radiograph measurement]",
  "date": "2017 May 25",
  "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the relationship between position of head, cervical curvature type and associated cervical balance parameters in a neutral looking-forward posture.\nMethods: Cervical lateral X-rays of 60 patients with cervical spondylosis were selected from January to December 2015. There were 22 males and 38 females with an average age of (35.5±10.9) years old. The measured parameters included cervical curvature type, McGregor slope, C2 lower end plate slope, T1 slope, center of gravity to C7 sagittal vertical offset (CG-C7 SVA), and C2 to C7 sagittal vertical offset (C2-C7 SVA). The parameters were analyzed using Spearman correlation.\nResults: The cervical curvature type was significantly correlated with C2 lower endplate slope, C0-C2 angle (total degree of C2 lower endplate slope plus McGregor slope), CG-C7 SVA and T1 slope (P<0.05), but it was not significantly correlated McGregor slope (P>0.05). C2 lower endplate slope and C2-C7 SVA (r=0.87) were significantly (P<0.05) correlated with CG-C7 SVA (P<0.05).\nConclusions: There was certain some relationship among position of head, cervical curvature type and associated cervical balance parameters in a neutral looking-forward posture. The center of gravity of the head would backwards shift following faced upward. A position of extension with posterior-shifting of the head would suggest that it may be accompanied with a relatively normal lordosis of the cervical spine. Some patients with abnormal curvature showed slightly bended head in the natural posture. Health education toward these people would be meaningful to restore the balance of their neck."

  "date": "2018 Jan",
  "abstract": "[Purpose] The purpose of this study is to determine the effect that secondary postural deformities and chronic postural abnormalities have on lung capacity, as well as correlate the activity of the respiratory muscles. The results provide basic objective data about the forward head posture and respiratory muscle activity that can be used in clinical situations. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects used in this study were 24 patients aged 25 to 35 years old who visited a hospital in Jeollanam-do Province, Korea, between September 2015 and January 2016. The patients were diagnosed with forward head posture because the vertical line between the acromion process and the external acoustic meatus was at least 5 cm. We measured the craniovertebral angle, pulmonary functions, and respiratory muscle activity of the subjects for correlation analysis. [Results] A positive correlation was found between the craniovertebral angle and the forced vital capacity (r=0.63), while a negative correlation was found between the craniovertebral angle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle (r=-0.77). The craniovertebral angle and the anterior scalene muscle showed a negative correlation (r=-0.65). There were positive correlations between the forced vital capacity and the sternocleidomastoid muscle (r=0.71), and between the forced vital capacity and the anterior scalene muscle (r=0.59). [Conclusion] Severe forward head posture increased the activities of the sternocleidomastoid muscles and the anterior scalene muscles, and decreased the forced vital capacity. Thus, it is necessary to develop more efficient interventions for managing forward head posture based on pulmonary function and the activity of the respiratory synergist muscles."

  "title": "Biomechanical and physiological age differences in a simulated forward fall on outstretched hands in women",
  "date": "2018 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Falling on the outstretched hands, a protective mechanism to arrest the body and avoid injury, requires upper limb and trunk motor control for effective body descent. Older women are particularly susceptible to injury from a forward fall, but the biomechanical and physiological (e.g., muscle strength) factors related to this increased risk are poorly understood. Determining age differences in the modifiable neuromuscular factors related to a forward fall landing and descent could help to inform injury prevention strategies. The purpose was to investigate age related differences in upper extremity strength and fall arrest strategy differences during a simulated fall and to evaluate the relationships between muscle strength and biomechanical variables.\nMethods: Nineteen younger (mean age 23.0 yrs., SD 3.8) and 16 older (mean age 68.2 yrs., SD 5.3) women performed five trials of simulated falls. Biomechanical measures and electromyographic muscle activity were recorded during the descents. Concentric, isometric and eccentric strength of the non-dominant upper limb was measured via a dynamometer using a customized protocol.\nFindings: Older women demonstrated lower concentric elbow extension strength compared to younger women (p = 0.002). Landing strategies differed where younger women had significantly greater elbow joint angle (p = 0.006) and velocity (p = 0.02) at impact. Older women demonstrated diminished capacity to absorb energy and control descent on outstretched hands compared to younger women (p = 0.001).\nInterpretation: The landing strategy used by older women along with decreased energy absorption may increase risk of fall-related injury and increase the likelihood of trunk or head impact with the ground."

  "title": "Ergonomic risk and preventive measures of musculoskeletal disorders in the dentistry environment: an umbrella review",
  "date": "2018 Jan 15",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Dental practitioners are exposed to different occupational hazards during the course of their professional activity, such as physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic factors. The ergonomic hazards, caused by strained posture and prolonged repetitive movements, can induce musculoskeletal disorders. It occurs in 54-93% of dental professionals and involve the spine, shoulder and hand-wrist tract. Through a systematic review of international literature, we analyzed specific ergonomic risk factors and preventive measures of musculoskeletal disorders in professional dental activity.\nMethods: This systematic review is coherent with the PRISMA statement. The scientific research on the major online databases was based on the following keywords: dentist, prevention, ergonomic, dentistry, musculoskeletal, neck pain, posture, ergonomics, work and occupational. The studies included in this review focus on disorders related to ergonomics and on the most effective preventive measures to be adopted. No restrictions were applied for language or publication type. We excluded reports not related to ergonomic prevention in dentistry, reports of minor academic significance, editorial articles, individual contributions, and studies published in scientific conferences.\nResults: Online research indicated 4188 references: PubMed (2919), Scopus (1257) e Cochrane Library (12). We excluded 3012 of these, because they were unrelated to ergonomics theme and 187 due to duplication. From the remaining 989 studies, 960 papers did not meet inclusion criteria and they were excluded. Therefore, we analyzed 29 articles, including 16 narrative reviews and 13 original article. The main risk factor for the development of musculoskeletal disorders found in our analysis is static posture adopted during work, highlighted in 87.5% of reviews and 84% of original articles. With regard to preventive measures, 75% of the reviews highlighted the importance of stretching after each working session and at the end of the working day, while 61.5% of the original articles emphasized the use of modern and ergonomic instruments.\nDiscussion: This review showed that static postures are strongly responsible in the etiology of musculoskeletal disorders. The awkward postures more frequently identified among dental professionals are: extreme forward-head and neck flexion; trunk inclination and rotation towards one side; lifting one or both shoulders; increased curvature of the thoracic vertebral column; incorrect positioning of the lower limbs with thigh-leg angle of less than 90°. It is really important to use of a modern workstation with appropriate ergonomic supports. Among the preventive ergonomic measures, literature has widely recognized the role of physical activity and of a neutral and balanced posture. The present review has some limits: a large part of the selected studies did not have a high methodological quality score and an inadequate statistical analysis."

  "date": "2018",
  "abstract": "Background: Motion analysis has great potential for quantitatively evaluating dental operator posture and the impact of interventions such as magnification loupes on posture and subsequent development of musculoskeletal disorders.\nObjective: This study sought to determine the feasibility of motion capture technology for measurement of dental operator posture and examine the impact that different styles of magnification loupes had on dental operator posture.\nMethods: Forward and lateral head flexion were measured for two different operators while completing a periodontal probing procedure. Each was measured while wearing magnification loupes (flip up-FL and through the lens-TTL) and basic safety lenses.\nResults: Operators both exhibited reduced forward flexion range of motion (ROM) when using loupes (TTL or FL) compared to a baseline lens (BL). In contrast to forward flexion, no consistent trends were observed for lateral flexion between subjects.\nConclusions: The researchers can report that it is possible to measure dental operator posture using motion capture technology. More study is needed to determine which type of magnification loupes (FL or TTL) are superior in improving dental operator posture. Some evidence was found supporting that the quality of operator posture may more likely be related to the use of magnification loupes, rather than the specific type of lenses worn."

  "title": "Intraocular currents, Bernoulli's principle and non-drainage scleral buckling for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment",
  "date": "2018 Feb",
  "abstract": "For many years, it is not fully understood how non-drainage scleral buckling surgery brings about spontaneous reattachment of the detached retina when retinal breaks remain open at the end of surgery. Various explanations have been put forward, but none more interesting than the effect of fluid currents associated with eye movements. One such explanation involved the physics of the Bernoulli's principle. Daniel Bernoulli was an eighteenth century Swiss mathematician and he described an equation based on the conservation of energy. The sum of pressure energy, potential energy and kinetic energy remains constant. Bernoulli's equation usually applies to closed system such as the flow of fluid through pipes. When fluid flows through a constriction, the speed of fluid increases, the kinetic energy increases. If there was no change in elevation (potential energy), then the increase in kinetic energy must be accompanied by a decrease in pressure energy. In ophthalmic surgery, the Bernoulli's effect is the basis for venturi pumps that drive vitrectomy and phacoemulsification machines. This essay expounds on how Bernoulli's effect might be relevant to scleral buckling for retinal detachment repair. In the era when vitrectomy is increasing the primary surgical operation for retinal detachment, the pervasive advice is to emphasise the importance of patient adopting head posture and remaining still postoperatively. The exception is non-drainage scleral buckling surgery. Early postoperative mobilisation may be vital to achieve reattachment."

  "date": "2018 Jun",
  "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the addition of manual therapy and therapeutic exercise protocol to inspiratory muscle training was more effective in improving maximum inspiratory pressure than inspiratory muscle training in isolation.\nDesign: This is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial.\nSubjects: In total, 43 patients with asthma were included in this study.\nInterventions: The patients were allocated into one of the two groups: (1) inspiratory muscle training ( n = 21; 20-minute session) or (2) inspiratory muscle training (20-minute session) combined with a program of manual therapy (15-minute session) and therapeutic exercise (15-minute session; n = 22). All participants received 12 sessions, two days/week, for six weeks and performed the domiciliary exercises protocol.\nMain measures: The main measures such as maximum inspiratory pressure, spirometric measures, forward head posture, and thoracic kyphosis were recorded at baseline and after the treatment.\nResults: For the per-protocol analysis, between-group differences at post-intervention were observed in maximum inspiratory pressure (19.77 cmH2O (11.49-28.04), P < .05; F = 22.436; P < .001; η2p = 0.371) and forward head posture (-1.25 cm (-2.32 to -0.19), P < .05; F = 5.662; P = .022; η2p = 0.13). The intention-to-treat analysis showed the same pattern of findings.\nConclusion: The inspiratory muscle training combined with a manual therapy and therapeutic exercise program is more effective than its application in isolation for producing short-term maximum inspiratory pressure and forward head posture improvements in patients with asthma."

  "abstract": "Objective: To determine the effect of cochlear implant surgery on the balance and risk of falls in an adult patient population using a mobile posturograph.\nDesign: Prospective clinical pilot study.\nSetting: Cochlear implant center at a tertiary referral hospital.\nSubjects and methods: Twenty adult patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery were tested using a mobile posturograph (VertiGuard). The standard balancing deficit test, or the geriatric standard balancing deficit test protocol (for patients older than 60 yr), was performed both 1 day before and 3 to 5 days after surgery.\nOutcome measures: The risk of falls (%) was calculated from the body sway both forward-to-backward and side-to-side in degrees per second.\nResults: The mean preoperative risk of falls in the whole study population was 51% (24-max. 86%) and was thus already higher than that in a normal healthy population (norm 0-40%). Comparison of the postoperative risk of falls to the preoperative risk for all 20 patients revealed a mean increased risk of falls of 1.25% after CI surgery. This is not a statistically significant increase. There was also no statistically significant increase when comparing the fall risk calculated using either the standard balancing deficit test protocol or the geriatric standard balancing deficit test protocol alone.\nConclusion: Postural control in cochlear implant candidates is already decreased before surgery compared with a healthy population. However Comparison of pre- and postoperative body sway measurements did not reveal a significant increase in fall risk as a result of cochlea implant surgery. Therefore in this study population, cochlear implant surgery did not influence balance and risk of falls. Further testing with a larger study population would be necessary to determine the development of falls risk over time after cochlear implant surgery."

  "date": "2017 Dec 12",
  "abstract": "Objective: To validate the usefulness of the supine position in microsurgery for lesions of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) by the retrosigmoid approach. Methods: Thirty-nine patients with lesions (22 cases of tumor, 11 cases of trigeminal neuralgia and 6 cases of hemifacial spasm) of the CPA underwent tumor resection surgery or microvascular decompression surgery (MVDS). The patients were operated on in the supine position by retrosigmoid approach with the head turned 50 to 60 degrees away from the lesion and with slight forward flexion of the neck. Results: In the supine position, the surgery spent less time in the preoperative preparation period, and had minimal cerebellar retraction, with no resection of the cerebellum. There was no pressure sore and the brachial plexus injury in these patients. Gross total resection was achieved in 18 of patients, and subtotal resection happened in 4 patients. The vascular structures were separated from the trigeminal nerve or the facial nerve in microvascular decompression and thus the preoperative symptoms alleviated. Conclusions: In the supine position, the retrosigmoid approach alleviates cerebellar retraction, increases the exposure and gives better access to the CPA lesions. The associated postoperative complications are negligible. The method is more suitable for elder, debilitated or obese patients."

Patients aged 10 to 15years (N=243, mean age 12. 6) seeking comprehensive dental care were analyzed according to RDC/ TMD. For static postural assessment, photographs were taken and analyzed by a physiotherapist following Kendall's model. Patients were divided into: A: without TMD (n=133); B: with muscle disorders (n=61); C: with disk displacement (N=49). No difference in age wasobserved between groups (p=0. 95). Significant association was observed between muscular TMD and alterations in spinal curves, head posture, and lower limbs: OR: 3. 40, 2. 44 and 2. 22 respectively. The most frequent types were hyperlordosis 23. 30 and 32. 78%; forward head posture 39. 85 and 52. 45%; and genu valgum 33. 08 and 45. 90% in A and B respectively. Alterations in head posture, vertebral curves and lower limbs could be considered risk factors for muscular TMD. The most frequent postural alterations were lumbar hyperlordosis, forward head posture and genu valgus."

  "date": "2018 Jan",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to compare neck extensor muscle thickness, thickness changes, and strength between participants with forward head posture (FHP) and controls with normal head posture (NHP).\nMethods: Twenty college students with FHP (mean age 21.30 ± 2.36 years) and 20 students with NHP (mean age 21.85 ± 2.78 years) participated in this case-control study. The thickness of neck extensor muscles was measured at rest and at maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). In addition, the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was calculated. To compare thickness changes between the 2 groups and among 5 muscles, a 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance was applied. In addition, Pearson's correlation test was performed to investigate the relationship between neck extensor MVIC and CVA.\nResults: The FHP group demonstrated lower MVIC compared with the NHP group (P = .03). Semispinalis capitis showed the smallest thickness changes during neck extensor MVIC in FHP compared with the controls (P < .001). However, no significant difference in terms of muscle thickness was observed between the 2 groups at the state of rest (P = .16-.99). A positive association was also found between the MVIC and CVA (P = .02).\nConclusions: Semispinalis capitis had less thickness changes during MVIC of neck extensors in individuals with FHP compared with those with NHP. This indirectly implies lower activity of this muscle in FHP condition. This study finding may help researchers develop therapeutic exercise protocols to manage FHP."

  "abstract": "Background: An aberrant upper body posture has been proposed as one of the etiological factors contributing to the development of subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS). Clinicians have translated this supposition into assessment and rehabilitation programs despite insufficient and conflicting evidence to support this approach.\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to compare several postural variables between the SAIS patients and asymptomatic healthy controls.\nStudy design: Case-Control Study.\nMethods: A total of 75 participants including 39 patients (20 females; 19 males) and 36 healthy controls (15 females; 21 males) participated in the study. Study evaluated several postural variables including forward head posture (FHP), forward shoulder posture (FSP), thoracic kyphosis index (TKI), scapular index (SI), normalized scapular protraction (NSP), and the lateral scapular slide test (LSST). The variables were compared between patient and control groups according to sex.\nResults: Significant differences were observed in the female patients compared to asymptomatic controls for the FHP (49.38 + 9.6o vs 55.5o+8.38, p=0.03), FSP (45.58 + 10.1o vs 53.68 + 7.08, p=0.02), and LSST in third position (10.2 + 2.1cm vs 11.5 + 0.7cm, p=0.01). Male patients showed a significant difference only in the FSP compared to controls (61.9o+9.4o vs 49.78 + 9.28, p<0.001).\nConclusions: While inadequate data on the relationship between dysfunctional posture and SAIS has led to broad variations in current rehabilitation strategies, the results of the present study revealed different patterns of postural aberrations in female and male patients with SAIS. This clarifies the need to develop individualized or sex-specific approaches for assessing posture in men and women with SAIS and rehabilitation programs based on the assessment results.\nLevel of evidence: 3b."

  "date": "2017 Oct",
  "abstract": "[Purpose] This study aimed to determine the effect of forward head posture-improving exercises on rounded shoulder posture when employing the self-stretch exercise, the McKenzie exercise, and the Kendall exercise as intervention methods based on previous studies that reported negative effects of unbalanced posture and musculoskeletal problems on forward head posture and rounded shoulder posture. [Subjects and Methods] The selected 28 subjects were randomly assigned into the McKenzie exercise group (n=9), the self-stretch exercise group (n=10), and the Kendall exercise group (n=9). To compare the forward head posture, the craniovertebral angle was used. To measure the rounded shoulder posture, the scapular index was used. [Results] There were significant differences in the craniovertebral angle and scapular index within the groups and no significant differences between the groups. [Conclusion] The result of this study showed that all interventions increased the craniovertebral angle and the scapular index, which revealed that the applied exercises had a positive effect on forward head posture and rounded shoulder posture."

  "title": "Neuromuscular compensatory strategies at the trunk and lower limb are not resolved following an ACL reconstruction",
  "date": "2018 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), patients present with greater trunk ipsilateral lean, which may affect knee kinetics and increase re-injury risk. However, there has been little research into neuromuscular factors controlling the trunk and their relation to the knee between healthy and ACLR subjects. This is critical to establish in order to develop more directed and effective interventions.\nHypothesis: As compared to healthy control subjects, ACLR subjects will demonstrate increased erector spinae and rectus abdominis co-contraction, greater rectus abdominis force and greater hamstring force that is correlated to increased forward trunk lean.\nStudy design: Cross-sectional study, Level of Evidence: 3.\nMethods: Eleven healthy and eleven ACLR subjects were matched for age, mass and height. Subjects were asked to run at a self-selected speed while instrumented gait analysis was performed. An anthropometrically scaled OpenSim model was created for each subject. Trunk and hamstring muscle forces from Static Optimization were analyzed at impact peak. Additionally, directed co-contraction ratios were calculated for the erector spinae and erector spinae/rectus abdominis combinations.\nResults: ACLR subjects showed more balanced erector spinae co-contraction [p<0.01], and greater hamstring force [biceps femoris long head (p=0.02), semimembranosus (0.01), semitendinosus (0.01)]. There was no statistical difference for any other muscle group.\nConclusion: Despite release to return to sport, ACLR subjects are continuing to increase the stiffness of their trunk as well increase their hamstring force to potentially reduce anterior tibial translation.\nClinical relevance: Clinicians may anticipate ACLR subjects using their erector spinae and hamstrings to maintain a sense of stability in their trunk and at their knee."

  "date": "2017 Mar 16",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The impact of wearing lenses on visual and musculoskeletal complaints in VDU workers is currently unknown. The goal of this study was 1) to evaluate the impact of wearing VDU lenses on visual fatigue and self-reported neck pain and disability, compared to progressive lenses, and 2) to measure the effect of both lenses on head inclination and pressure pain thresholds during the performance of a VDU task.\nMethods: Thirty-five eligible subjects were randomly assigned to wear progressive VDU lenses (VDU group) (n = 18) or progressive lenses (P group) (n = 17). They were enquired about visual complaints (VFQ), self-perceived pain (NRS) and disability (NDI) at baseline (with old lenses), and 1 week, 3 months and 6 months after wearing their new lenses. In addition, Forward Head Angle (FHA) and PPTs were assessed during and after a VDU task before and 6 months after wearing the new lenses. A short questionnaire concerning the satisfaction about the study lenses was completed at the end of the study.\nResults: In both groups, visual fatigue and neck pain was decreased at 3 and 6 months follow up, compared to baseline. All PPTs were higher during the second VDU task, independent of the type of lenses. The VDU group reported a significantly higher suitability of the lenses for VDU work.\nConclusion: It can be concluded that there is little difference in effect of the different lenses on visual and musculoskeletal comfort. Lenses should be adjusted to the task-specific needs and habits of the participant."

  "date": "2017 Aug",
  "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of dental magnification loupes on posture during instrumentation.Methods: A convenience sample of 27 right-handed dental hygienists, with no prior history of injuries or disabilities of the head, neck, or trunk region, enrolled in the study. Baseline posture calibration was taken and tri-axial accelerometers were placed on four locations of the head and trunk (occipital region of head; cervical vertebrae C5; thoracic vertebrae T5; lumbar vertebrae L1) to measure acceleration and the orientation of the body to gravity. Participants were randomly assigned to wear self-supplied magnification loupes during either the first or second half of the session. Dental chair mounted typodonts, prepared with artificial calculus, were used to represent a simulated oral environment. Participants were asked to explore all areas of the mouth using an ODU 11/12 explorer. Mean accelerations of the three axes were used to compute average forward/backward (AP) and side to side (ML) tilt of each accelerometer recorded during the instrumentation sessions. An end-user opinion survey was completed by each participant at the conclusion of the session.Results: No statistically significant differences in posture were revealed between the sessions with the participants wearing their loupes and not wearing loupes. However, data from the end-user survey indicate that 74% of all the participants strongly agreed that magnification loupes made exploring easier and 67% strongly agreed that they felt that magnification loupes improved their posture.Conclusion: While the majority of participants perceived that their magnification loupes enhanced their posture and made exploring easier, data from this study provided little evidence to suggest that wearing loupes leads to improved body orientation. Future research needs to examine the declination angle of ergonomic loupes and its relationship to neck and trunk flexion."

  "abstract": "This study investigated the correlation between the neck disability index (NDI) and visual analogue scale (VAS), which are indicators of neck pain, shoulder joint range of motion (ROM), and muscle strength in women with a slight forward head posture. This study was carried out on 42 female college students attending Uiduk University in Gyeongju, Korea. The neck pain and disability index for each subject was measured using VAS and NDI, respectively. Two physiotherapists measured the shoulder joint ROM and muscle strengths of the subjects using a goniometer and a dynamometer, respectively. External rotation, internal rotation, and abduction of the shoulder joint were measured for each subject. A significant negative correlation between neck pain and shoulder joint ROM in external rotation and the muscle strength of the shoulder joint in abduction was found in the subjects. In addition, a significant positive correlation was observed between ROM in external rotation and muscle strength in abduction. This study showed a significant negative correlation between neck pain and ROM in external rotation as well as between neck pain and the muscle strength in abduction."

  "title": "Tread-water feeding of Bryde's whales",
  "date": "2017 Nov 6",
  "abstract": "Many previous studies have shown that rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae), including the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whale (B. physalus), sei whale (B. borealis), Bryde's whale (B. edeni), minke whale (B. acutorostrata), and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), employ a strategy called lunge feeding to capture a large amount of krill and/or fish for nourishment [1]. Lunge feeding entails a high energetic cost due to the drag created by an open mouth at high speeds [1,2]. In the upper Gulf of Thailand, Bryde's whales, which feed on small fish species [3], predominantly anchovies, demonstrated a range of feeding behaviors such as oblique, vertical, and lateral lunging. Moreover, they displayed a novel head-lifting feeding behavior characterized by holding the vertical posture for several seconds with an open mouth at the water surface. This study describes the head-lifting feeding by Bryde's whales, which is distinct from the typical lunge feeding of rorqual whales. Whales showing this behavior were observed on 58 occasions, involving 31 whales and including eight adult-calf pairs. Whales caught their prey using a series of coordinated movements: (i) lifting the head above the water with a closed mouth, (ii) opening the mouth until the lower jaw contacted the sea surface, which created a current of water flowing into the mouth, (iii) holding their position for several seconds, (iv) waiting for the prey to enter the mouth, and (v) closing the mouth and engulfing the prey underwater (Figure 1A-F, Movie S1 in Supplemental Information published with this article online). When a whale kept its upper jaw above the sea surface, many anchovies in the targeted shoal appeared to lose orientation and flowed passively into the mouth of the whale by the current created by the lower mandible breaking the surface of the water. We measured the duration of feeding events when the whales had a wide-open mouth mostly above the sea surface. The mean and maximum feeding durations were 14.5 ± 5.4 (SD; n = 58 events) and 32 s, respectively. Deployment of animal-borne data loggers yielded approximately 44 minutes of recordings from a single whale. The acceleration data showed that stroke rates, including tail beat and whole-body movements during feeding, were faster (approximately 0.7 s cycle) than during a cruising swim (approximately 3 s cycle) (Figure 1G). The swimming speed was lower than that in the stall speed (0.2 m s-1) of the device during the feeding phase, suggesting that thrust force was used to hold the head up and to stabilize body posture (Figure 1G). Stable positioning using the fluke and flipper was confirmed by video data for both the downward and upward direction of the whale (Figure S1). According to the visual and behavioral data, we named the head-lifting feeding as 'tread-water feeding'. Generally, all species of baleen whale, including rorqual whales, show active chasing and feeding, i.e., skimming, suction, and engulfing with lunging [1]. Tread-water feeding is considered passive feeding as compared with other feeding behaviors because the whales do not swim forward in pursuit of prey during the period from mouth opening to closing, and although they need thrust force to stabilize their posture, the head does not actively move. To the best of our knowledge, this discovery of tread-water feeding in Bryde's whales represents the first report of passive feeding in baleen whales, which indicates their flexible capacity to modify their foraging strategy in relation to variable environments."

  "title": "Cervical sagittal balance: a biomechanical perspective can help clinical practice",
  "date": "2018 Feb",
  "abstract": "Purpose: In this article, we summarize our work on understanding the influence of cervical sagittal malalignment on the mechanics of the cervical spine.\nMethods: Biomechanical studies were performed using an ex vivo laboratory model to study the kinematic and kinetic response of human cervical spine specimens in the setting of cervical sagittal imbalance. The model allowed controlled variations of C2-C7 Sagittal Vertical Alignment (C2-C7 SVA) and T1-Slope so that clinically relevant sagittally malaligned profiles could be prescribed, while maintaining horizontal gaze, and their biomechanical consequences studied.\nResults: Our results demonstrated that increasing C2-C7 SVA caused flexion of lower cervical (C2-C7) segments and hyperextension of suboccipital (C0-C1-C2) segments to maintain horizontal gaze. An increase in C2-C7 SVA increased the lower cervical neural foraminal areas. Conversely, increasing T1-slope predominantly influenced subaxial cervical lordosis and, as a result, decreased cervical neural foraminal areas. Therefore, we believe patients with increased upper thoracic kyphosis and radicular symptoms may respond with increased forward head posture (FHP) as a compensatory mechanism to increase their lower cervical neural foraminal area and alleviate nerve root compression as well as reduce the burden on posterior muscles and soft and bony structures of the cervical spine. Increasing FHP (i.e., increased C2-C7 SVA) was associated with shortening of the cervical flexors and occipital extensors and lengthening of the cervical extensors and occipital flexors, which corresponds to C2-C7 flexion and C0-C2 extension. The greatest shortening occurred in the suboccipital muscles, suggesting considerable load bearing of these muscles during chronic FHP. Regardless, there was no evidence of nerve compression within the suboccipital triangle. Finally, cervical sagittal imbalance may play a role in exacerbating adjacent segment pathomechanics after multilevel cervical fusion and should be considered during surgical planning.\nConclusions: The results of our biomechanical studies have improved our understanding of the impact of cervical sagittal malalignment on pathomechanics of the cervical spine. We believe this improved understanding will assist in clinical decision-making."

  "date": "2018 Feb",
  "abstract": "Dropped head syndrome (DHS) is a cervical kyphotic deformity caused by apparent weakness of the neck extensor muscles. We often encounter patients whose symptoms, including impaired forward vision and neck pain, deteriorate while walking. This is the first report of a case of dynamic spinal alignment change in a patient with DHS during walking using three-dimensional gait analysis. A 78-year-old Japanese woman complained of impaired forward vision and neck pain while walking. Her radiograph showed severe cervical kyphosis. C2-C7 SVA was +74 mm and C7-S1 SVA was -18.4 mm. The patient attempted to compensate to improve forward vision through lumbar hyperlordosis. We analyzed the gait motion of the patient by using three-dimensional (3D) motion and wireless surface electromyographic analysis systems to measure two systems synchronously. The patient walked continuously for as long as possible. We calculated dynamic SVA from the 3D motion analysis. Her head drop deformity gradually progressed and interfered with her forward vision while walking. Cervical SVA gradually increased from 75 to 85 mm. Thoracic SVA, Lumbar SVA and Whole spine SVA were initially decreased because of compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis, but ultimately increased, suggesting decompensation by the time she had finished walking. EMG activity of the bilateral trapezius muscles gradually reduced, which reflected the disturbance of maintaining her posture. Previous static evaluation could not prove the dynamic change of spinal alignment and EMG activity during walking. By introducing 3D gait analysis, we could evaluate dynamic spinal alignment of a patient with DHS."

After the abstracts of the remaining studies were read, 15 were assessed for eligibility, and only 4 papers were included in the present review. Cervical lordosis values were found to be significantly associated with thoracic kyphosis values. Also, there were significant correlations between rounded shoulders and increased thoracic kyphosis.\nConclusion: Forward head posture, rounded shoulders, and increased thoracic kyphosis can exist alone or in any combination."

  "date": "2018 Mar",
  "abstract": "Objective: Augmentation index (AIx) is often used to quantify the contribution of wave reflection to central pulse pressure. Recent studies have challenged this view by showing how contractility-induced changes in the forward pressure wave can markedly impact AIx. We hypothesized that changes in preload will also affect AIx through changes in the forward wave and studied this in two experiments.\nMethods: Noninvasively obtained aortic pressure was used to study central haemodynamics and wave morphology. In the first experiment, we examined the effects of head-up tilt with and without unilateral thigh cuff in 12 young healthy volunteers (mean age 26 years, 50% men). In the second experiment, we examined the effects of active standing in 31 middle-aged patients (mean age 57 years, 65% men) before and after phlebotomy.\nResults: Head-up tilt or active standing significantly decreased AIx [-17.7 ± 10.4 percentage point (pp) in the young population, -4.7 ± 12.3 pp in the middle-aged population, both P < 0.05]. The fall in AIx was associated with increases in HR, diastolic pressure and systemic vascular resistance and a decrease in stroke volume (all P < 0.05). Inflation of a unilateral thigh cuff reduced the decrease in AIx by 10.7 pp, whereas 500 ml of blood loss augmented the fall in AIx by 5.9 pp (both P < 0.05). The changes in AIx were related to a preload-induced change in forward pressure wave shape (earlier peaking and steeper downstroke).\nConclusion: Next to inotropic and chronotropic effects, preload emerges as another myocardial factor that obscures the relation between wave reflection and AIx."

Kinematic data were recorded of head sway and reaching with the dominant arm in four sitting conditions: a horizontal and a 15° forward (FW) tilted seat surface, each with and without foot-support.\nResults: Seating condition did not affect head stability during reaching, but did affect kinematic reaching quality. The major reaching parameters, i.e., the proportion of reaches with one movement unit (MU) and the size of the transport MU, were not affected by foot-support. Forward-tilting had a positive effect on these parameters in children with US-CP, whereas the horizontal condition had this effect in children with BS-CP.\nImplications: A 15° forward-tilted seating and foot-support do not affect head stability. Reaching in children with US-CP profits from forward-tilting; in children with BS-CP forward-tilting worsens reaching - effects that are independent of foot-support."

  "title": "A potential link between lateral semicircular canal orientation, head posture, and dietary habits in extant rhinos (Perissodactyla, Rhinocerotidae)",
  "date": "2018 Jan",
  "abstract": "Extant rhinoceroses share the characteristic nasal horn, although the number and size of horns varies among the five species. Although all species are herbivores, their dietary preferences, occipital shapes, and common head postures vary. Traditionally, to predict the \"usual\" head posture (the most used head posture of animals during normal unstressed activities, i.e., standing) of rhinos, the occipital shape was used. While a backward inclined occiput implies a downward hanging head (often found in grazers), a forward inclined occiput is related to the horizontal head posture in browsing rhinos. In this study, the lateral semicircular canal (LSC) of the bony labyrinth was virtually reconstructed from µCT-images in order to investigate a possible link between LSC orientation and head posture in extant rhinoceroses. The usual head posture was formerly reconstructed for several non-rhinoceros taxa with the assumption that the LSC of the inner ear is held horizontal (parallel to the ground) during normal activity of the living animal. The current analysis of the LSC orientation resulted in a downward inclined usual head posture for the grazing white rhinoceros and a nearly horizontal head posture in the browsing Javan rhinoceros. The other three browsing or mixed feeding species show subhorizontal (closer to horizontal than a downgrade inclination) head postures. The results show that anatomical and behavioral aspects, like occipital shape, presence and size of horns/tusk-like lower incisors, as well as feeding and feeding height preferences influence the usual head posture. Because quantitative behavioral data are lacking for the usual head postures of the extant rhinos, the here described relationship between the LSC orientation and the resulting head posture linked to feeding preferences gives new insights. The results show, that the inner ear provides additional information to interpret usual head postures linked to feeding preferences that can easily be adapted to fossil rhinoceroses."

All had excessive daytime sleepiness, high arousal index and Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) <5. The mean body mass index was 20·1, mean arousal index 16·2, mean respiratory disturbance index 19·6, mean AHI 3·9 while the mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 14·8. Many had functional somatic complaints; 66·3% headaches, 41·9% neck aches, 53·5% masticatory muscle myalgia, 68·6% temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthralgia while 90·7% reported sleep bruxism (SB). Unlike patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), hypertension was uncommon (4·7%) while depression was prevalent at 68·6% with short REM latency of <90 min and an increased REM composition >25% documented in 79·6% and 57·6% of these depressed patients, respectively. 65·1% displayed a posteriorly displaced condyle at maximum intercuspation with or without TMJ clicking. Most exhibited a forward head posture (FHP) characterised by loss of normal cervical lordosis (80·2%), C0-C1 narrowing (38·4%) or an elevated hyoid position (50%), and 91·9% had nasal congestion. We postulate the TMD-UARS phenotype may have originally developed as an adaptive response to 'awake' disordered breathing during growth. Patients with persistent TMD and/or reporting SB should be screened for UARS and chronic nasal obstruction, especially when they also present with FHP. The lateral cephalogram is a useful tool in the differentiation of UARS from other OSA phenotypes."

  "abstract": "Objectives: Information Technology (IT) professionals working with computers gradually develop forward head posture and, as a result, these professionals are susceptible to several neck disorders. This study intended to reveal the relationships between pain intensity, disability, head posture and deep cervical flexor (DCF) muscle performance in patients with postural neck pain.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 84 IT professionals who were diagnosed with postural neck pain. The participants were recruited with a random sampling approach. A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ), the Modified Head Posture Spinal Curvature Instrument (MHPSCI), and the Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit were used to measure neck pain intensity, neck disability, head posture, and DCF muscle performance, respectively.\nResults: The Pearson correlation coefficient revealed a significantly strong positive relationship between the VAS and the NPQ (r = 0.734). The cranio-vertebral (CV) angle was found to have a significantly negative correlation with the VAS (r = -0.536) and a weak negative correlation with the NPQ (r = -0.389).\nConclusion: This study concluded that a smaller CV angle corresponded to greater neck pain intensity and disability. Furthermore, there is no significant relationship between CV angle and DCF muscle performance, indicating that head posture re-education through postural correction exercises would not completely correct the motor control deficits in DCF muscles. In addition, a suitable exercise regimen that exclusively targets the deep cervical flexor muscle to improve its endurance is warranted."

  "date": "2017 Jul 27",
  "abstract": "In retinitis pigmentosa (RP), loss of peripheral visual field accounts for most difficulties encountered in visuo-motor coordination during locomotion. The purpose of this study was to accurately assess the impact of peripheral visual field loss on gaze strategies during locomotion, and identify compensatory mechanisms. Nine RP subjects presenting a central visual field limited to 10-25° in diameter, and nine healthy subjects were asked to walk in one of three directions-straight ahead to a visual target, leftward and rightward through a door frame, with or without obstacle on the way. Whole body kinematics were recorded by motion capture, and gaze direction in space was reconstructed using an eye-tracker. Changes in gaze strategies were identified in RP subjects, including extensive exploration prior to walking, frequent fixations of the ground (even knowing no obstacle was present), of door edges, essentially of the proximal one, of obstacle edge/corner, and alternating door edges fixations when approaching the door. This was associated with more frequent, sometimes larger rapid-eye-movements, larger movements, and forward tilting of the head. Despite the visual handicap, the trajectory geometry was identical between groups, with a small decrease in walking speed in RPs. These findings identify the adaptive changes in sensory-motor coordination, in order to ensure visual awareness of the surrounding, detect changes in spatial configuration, collect information for self-motion, update the postural reference frame, and update egocentric distances to environmental objects. They are of crucial importance for the design of optimized rehabilitation procedures."

  "date": "2017 Oct",
  "abstract": "Forward head posture has been evaluated mostly by visual observation or simple non-invasive measurements without a standardized evaluation method or protocol. In this experimental study, the reliability of existing forward head-posture measurement methods was evaluated by computing the intra-class correlation coefficients of three different head-position variables (two horizontal gap variables and one head-orientation variable) in seven different posture conditions from 20 asymptomatic participants. The position variables of the head were measured three times using a three-dimensional motion capture system while sitting comfortably, sitting with the back straight, standing comfortably, standing with the back straight, walking at 4 and 6km/h on a treadmill, and running at 8km/h on a treadmill. Intra-class correlation coefficients between repetitive measures ranged from 0.81 to 0.96, and high correlation coefficient values (>0.9) were produced when the head-position variables were measured during straight sitting, straight standing, and walking at 6km/h. Among the three head-position variables, a horizontal gap between the tragus and the 7th cervical vertebra was recorded more consistently than other variables. Results of this study highlight the importance of a standardized evaluation protocol for more reliable assessment of the forward head posture."

  "date": "2017 Nov",
  "abstract": "Background: About 50%-70% of dislocators have cups placed within so-called \"safe zones.\" It has been postulated that factors such as femoral head size and pelvic tilt, obliquity, or rotation may influence postoperative stability. Therefore, we assessed varying degrees of pelvic tilt and head sizes on the range of motion (ROM) to impingement.\nMethods: A hip simulator was used to import models of 10 subjects who performed object pickup, squatting, and low-chair rising. Parameters were set for pelvic tilt, stem version, and the specific motions as defined by the subjects. Femur-to-pelvis relative motions were determined for abduction/adduction, internal/external rotation, and flexion/extension. Varying tilt angles were tested. Thirty-two millimeter and 36-mm head with a standard cup and 42-mm dual mobility cup were tested. Cup orientations for abduction and anteversion combinations were chosen, and computations of minimum clearances or impingement between components were made.\nResults: The ROM to impingement varied with the different pelvic tilts and femoral head sizes and with the different motions. The larger the head size, the larger the impingement-free ROM. Negative 10° of pelvic tilt led to the largest impingement-free zone, whereas 10° of forward tilt was associated with fewer impingement-free cup anteversion and abduction angle combinations. Variations in pelvic tilt had the greatest influence on object pickup and affected the impingement-free \"safe zone.\"\nConclusion: Targets for impingement-free motion may be smaller when considering varying pelvic tilts and femoral head sizes, particularly for certain activities, such as object pickup. These findings may indicate the need for more individualized patient planning."

  "title": "Predictors of upper trapezius pain with myofascial trigger points in food service workers: The STROBE study",
  "date": "2017 Jun",
  "abstract": "Shoulder pain occurs commonly in food service workers (FSWs) who repetitively perform motions of the upper limbs. Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) on the upper trapezius (UT) are among the most common musculoskeletal shoulder pain syndromes. This study determined the psychological, posture, mobility, and strength factors associated with pain severity in FSWs with UT pain due to MTrPs.In this cross-sectional study, we measured 17 variables in 163 FSWs with UT pain due to MTrPs: a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, age, sex, Borg rating of perceived exertion (BRPE) scale, beck depression inventory, forward head posture angle, rounded shoulder angle (RSA), shoulder slope angle, scapular downward rotation ratio, cervical lateral-bending side difference angle, cervical rotation side difference angle, glenohumeral internal rotation angle, shoulder horizontal adduction angle, serratus anterior (SA) strength, lower trapezius (LT) strength, bicep strength, and glenohumeral external rotator strength, in 163 FSWs with UT pain due to MTrPs.The model for factors influencing UT pain with MTrPs included SA strength, age, BRPE, LT strength, and RSA as predictor variables that accounted for 68.7% of the variance in VAS (P < .001) in multiple regression models with a stepwise selection procedure. The following were independent variables influencing the VAS in the order of standardized coefficients: SA strength (β = -0.380), age (β = 0.287), BRPE (β = 0.239), LT strength (β = -0.195), and RSA (β = 0.125).SA strength, age, BRPE, LT strength, and RSA variables should be considered when evaluating and intervening in UT pain with MTrPs in FSWs."

  "title": "Clinical assessment of subacromial shoulder impingement - Which factors differ from the asymptomatic population?",
  "date": "2017 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: To date, the significance of factors purported to be associated with subacromial shoulder impingement (SSI) and what differences, if any, are present in those with SSI compared to a matched asymptomatic population has not been identified. Gaining information about differences between people with SSI and asymptomatic people may direct clinicians towards treatments that impact upon these differences.\nObjective: Compare the assessment findings of factors suggested to be associated with SSI; passive posterior shoulder range, passive internal rotation range, resting cervical and thoracic postures, active thoracic range in standing and scapula positioning between cases experiencing SSI and a matched asymptomatic group (controls).\nStudy design: Case Control Study.\nMethod: Fifty one SSI cases and 51 asymptomatic controls were matched for age, gender, hand dominance and physical activity level. The suggested associated factors were measured bilaterally. Independent t-tests were used to compare each of these measurements between the groups. Any variables for which a significant difference was identified, were then included in a conditional logistic regression analysis to identify independent predictors of SSI.\nResults: The SSI group had significantly increased resting thoracic flexion and forward head posture, as well as significantly reduced upper thoracic active motion, passive internal rotation range and posterior shoulder range than the matched asymptomatic group. No independent predictors of SSI were identified in conditional logistic regression analysis.\nConclusion: Thoracic posture, passive internal rotation range and posterior shoulder range were significantly different between cases experiencing SSI and a matched asymptomatic group.\nLevel of evidence: Level 3a."

  "title": "Relationship Between Head-Turn Gait Speed and Lateral Balance Function in Community-Dwelling Older Adults",
  "date": "2017 Oct",
  "abstract": "Objective: To determine and compare gait speed during head-forward and side-to-side head-turn walking in individuals with lower versus greater lateral balance.\nDesign: Cross-sectional study.\nSetting: University research laboratory.\nParticipants: Older adults (N=93; 42 men, 51 women; mean age ± SD, 73 ± 6.08y) who could walk independently.\nMain outcome measures: (1) Balance tolerance limit (BTL), defined as the lowest perturbation intensity where a multistep balance recovery pattern was first evoked in response to randomized lateral waist-pull perturbations of standing balance to the left and right sides, at 6 different intensities (range from level 2: 4.5-cm displacement at 180cm/s2 acceleration, to level 7: 22.5-cm displacement at 900cm/s2 acceleration); (2) gait speed, determined using an instrumented gait mat; (3) balance, evaluated with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale; and (4) mobility, determined with the Timed Up and Go (TUG).\nResults: Individuals with low versus high BTL had a slower self-selected head-forward gait speed and head-turn gait speed (P=.002 and P<.001, respectively); the magnitude of difference was greater in head-turn gait speed than head-forward gait speed (Cohen's d=1.0 vs 0.6). Head-turn gait speed best predicted BTL. BTL was moderately and positively related (P=.003) to the ABC Scale and negatively related (P=.017) to TUG.\nConclusions: Head-turn gait speed is affected to a greater extent than head-forward gait speed in older individuals with poorer lateral balance and at greater risk of falls. Moreover, head-turn gait speed can be used to assess the interactions of limitations in lateral balance function and gait speed in relation to fall risk in older adults."

  "date": "2018 Oct",
  "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate whether patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain and having moderate to severe disability have a greater cervical motor function impairment and respiratory disturbances compared with patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain having mild disability and asymptomatic subjects; and the association between these outcomes in patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain and healthy controls.\nMethods: Cross-sectional study, 44 patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain and 31 healthy subjects participated. The neck disability index was used to divide the patients into 2 groups: 1) mild disability group (scores between 5 and 14 points); and 2) moderate to severe disability group (scores >14 points). Cervical motor function was measured by cervical range of motion, forward head posture, neck flexor, and extensor muscle strength. Respiratory function and maximum respiratory pressures were also measured.\nResults: Statistically differences were found between the patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain having a moderate to severe disability and the asymptomatic subjects for cervical and respiratory muscle strength. Comparisons between chronic nonspecific neck pain and the asymptomatic groups showed differences for all the variables, except for forward head posture. The regression model determined that strength of cervical flexion explained 36.4 and 45.6% of the variance of maximum inspiratory pressures and maximum expiratory pressures, respectively.\nConclusions: Only the chronic nonspecific neck pain group with moderate to severe disability showed differences compared with the healthy subjects. Neck muscle strength could be a good predictor of respiratory muscle function. Implications for rehabilitation Neck pain severity could be closely associated with decreased respiratory pressure in patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain. These findings suggest a new therapeutic approach for patients with moderate to severe disability, such as respiratory muscle training. The regression models show that a simple measurement of neck muscle strength could provide a reasonably accurate prediction for the respiratory function of these patients. Hence, this could provide an easy tool to assess respiratory function to physiotherapists without the need for sophisticated instrumentation."

  "title": "Tailor-made management of thoracic scoliosis with cervical hyperextension in muscular dystrophy",
  "date": "2018 Feb",
  "abstract": "Purpose: We report the case of a 13-year-old boy managed for fixed cervical hyperextension due to congenital muscular dystrophy with partial merosin deficiency. He presented a right decompensated thoracic scoliosis (T6-L1 Cobb angle 72°) associated with cervical and lumbar lordosis. The spinal extension was accompanied by major flexion of the hip resulting in the trunk being bent forward. This posture caused daily severe back pain responsible for significant loss of quality of life. This led to the decision to perform surgery.\nMethods: Initially, the surgery was limited to the thoraco-lumbo-sacral area. An anterior release was done, followed by posterior T1-pelvis vertebral fusion using a modified Luque-Galveston technique. The correction achieved was satisfactory in the coronal plane, but the correction of the thoracic kyphosis was insufficient to compensate for the cervical hyperextension. Cervical spine was fixed at 52° of lordosis, and associated with a left 50° rotation and a right 45° inclination of the head. We performed a posterior and lateral release of the cervical muscles followed by positioning of the halo, itself connected to a made-for-measure thoracic corset. A daily adjustment of the threaded rods was done daily for 3 months to correct the cervical position. Then, we performed a spinal fusion without instrumentation, by posterior articular abrasion and grafting from the occiput to T1. Following that, the halo-corset was kept in place for 4 months.\nResults: At the end of 8 month treatment, the clinical result was satisfactory with a balanced spine both face on, and sideways, allowing for comfortable painless positioning. At 5 year follow-up, he showed stable spinal fusion without any loss of correction.\nConclusion: There is no gold standard treatment for cervical hyperextension, but approaches have to be tailor-made to the patient's needs and the team's experience."

  "abstract": "Background: Heavy backpacks have been associated with various postural changes and consequently musculoskeletal disorders.\nObjective: We evaluated the immediate responses of varying backpack loads on cranio-vertebral angle (CVA), sagittal shoulder angle (SSA) and trunk forward lean (TFL) of young adults between the ages of 18-25 years.\nMethods: This was a 3×3 cross over randomized controlled study with repeated measures among a convenience sample of young adults (n = 30; 50% male, 50% female). Each participant in a standing posture was assessed at four different loads: no backpack, carrying backpack of 5%, 10%, and 15% of body weight (BW). A sagittal photograph was taken of the area of the body corresponding to spinal angle during each of these test conditions to allow for later analysis of postural deviations. Comparisons of the mean deviations of the different postural angles from baseline and between test conditions were made using ANOVA at p≤0.05.\nResults: Generally, there was a trend toward a decrease in the CVA and TFL with increasing backpack loads. Specifically, a significant decrease was seen for TFL at10% and 15% BW loads when compared with no load condition. In contrast, the decrease in CVA was only significant between no load condition and 15% body weight load. The SSA remained unchanged with backpack weight within 15% BW.\nConclusion: Whereas the SSA of young adults may not be upset by an acute loading with a backpack within 15% of body weight, a 15% BW backpack led to more forward posture of the head on the neck. In addition, backpack load as low as 10% BW is enough to cause an immediate forward lean of the trunk."

  "date": "2017 Jun",
  "abstract": "Background: Based on anecdotal and observational evidence, we hypothesized that the prevalence of cervical musculoskeletal disorder (C-MSD) would be high among plastic surgeons. A questionnaire review was undertaken to test this hypothesis. Ergonomic assessment was undertaken to assess causal factors of C-MSD.\nMethod: An anonymous questionnaire recording demographics, physical symptoms and behavioral responses to C-MSD was distributed to UK Plastic Surgery consultants. The postural impact of wearing loupes was assessed using motion capture techniques and recording cervical muscular activity.\nResults: The questionnaire response rate was 81%. The prevalence of cervical spine morbidity was recorded as 32%. Employment implications included 28% of the cohort requiring sick leave. The professional impact was 7% permanently modifying their practice. There were 2 factors significant for C-MSD, the surgeons' age and the duration in hours of wearing loupes per week. Ergonomic assessment of surgeons operating in loupes demonstrated: 1. increased forward and lateral cervical flexion; 2. increased cervical muscular activity to maintain the protracted \"head forward\" posture; and 3. prolonged static posturing to maintain head position for visual focus. Table height adjustment and variation of loupe working distance can reduce neck flexion.\nConclusions: Cervical morbidity is a prevalent problem among plastic surgeons. Long procedures, static postures and neck flexion result in the \"head forward\" posture. This posture exaggerates when operating with loupe magnification. Early-middle-aged consultants are more prone to cervical morbidity hence afflicted when at the top of their game. The work force is diminished for a potentially avoidable morbidity. Rather than accept this morbidity, co-operation between plastic surgeons and ergonomist may help to reduce injury."

  "abstract": "Objectives: We developed a novel system for in home functional capacities assessment in frail older adults by analyzing the Timed Up and Go movements. This system aims to follow the older people evolution, potentially allowing a forward detection of motor decompensation in order to trigger the implementation of rehabilitation. However, the pre-experimentations conducted on the ground, in different environments, revealed some problems which were related to KinectTM operation. Hence, the aim of this actual study is to develop methods to resolve these problems.\nMethods: Using the KinectTM sensor, we analyze the Timed Up and Go test movements by measuring nine spatio-temporal parameters, identified from the literature. We propose a video processing chain to improve the robustness of the analysis of the various test phases: automatic detection of the sitting posture, patient detection and three body joints extraction. We introduce a realistic database and a set of descriptors for sitting posture recognition. In addition, a new method for skin detection is implemented to facilitate the patient extraction and head detection. 94 experiments were conducted to assess the robustness of the sitting posture detection and the three joints extraction regarding condition changes.\nResults: The results showed good performance of the proposed video processing chain: the global error of the sitting posture detection was 0.67%. The success rate of the trunk angle calculation was 96.42%. These results show the reliability of the proposed chain, which increases the robustness of the automatic analysis of the Timed Up and Go.\nConclusions: The system shows good measurements reliability and generates a note reflecting the patient functional level that showed a good correlation with 4 clinical tests commonly used. We suggest that it is interesting to use this system to detect impairment of motor planning processes."

  "date": "2017 May-Jun",
  "abstract": "Background: Forward head posture (FHP) is a forward positioning of the head relative to the trunk in the sagittal plane. This posture is one of the most prevalent poor postures in patients with head and neck pain. Rehabilitative Ultrasound Imaging (RUSI) is a reliable method to objectively evaluate muscle thickness and function.\nObjective: To compare thickness of cervical muscles that control both head and neck posture between asymptomatic women with and without FHP.\nMethods: Seventy asymptomatic women aged between 20 and 40 years, with and without FHP (35 in each group), participated in the study. The thickness of the cervical muscles (rectus capitis posterior - RCP, oblique capitis superior - OCS, semispinalis capitis - SSC, sternocleidomastoid - SCM, and longus coli - LCo) was measured using RUSI and the data was compared between the two groups.\nResults: The comparison of cervical muscle thickness between women with and without FHP revealed significant difference only with regard to the muscle thickness of the SCM muscle (mean difference: 0.7mm, 95% confidence interval of the difference: 0.14, 1.26mm, p value: 0.014). The thickness of this muscle was greater in women with FHP.\nConclusion: Tonic contraction of the SCM muscle can lead to greater thickness of this muscle in subjects with FHP."

Craniovertebral angle (CVA), cranial rotational angle (CRA), vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and upper trapezius activity ratios were measured.\nResults: Significant positive correlations were found between CVA and VC, FVC, FEV1, PEF, and MVV, and a significant negative correlation was found between CVA and SCM activity ratio. Significant negative correlations existed between CRA and VC and FVC, and significant positive correlations between CRA and SCM and upper trapezius activity ratios.\nConclusion: FHP may act to lower respiratory functions, and thus, the maintenance of correct head posture is required to prevent such functional reductions."

  "date": "2017 Jul 1",
  "abstract": "Background: Forward head posture (FHP) may be associated with neck pain and poor health-related quality of life. Literature describes only qualitative muscle length changes associated with FHP.\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to quantify how muscle-tendon unit lengths are altered when human cadaveric specimens are placed in alignments representing different severities of FHP.\nDesign: This biomechanical study used 13 fresh-frozen cadaveric cervical spine specimens (Occiput-T1, 54±15 y).\nMethods: Specimens' postural changes simulating increasing FHP severity while maintaining horizontal gaze were assessed. Specimen-specific anatomic models derived from computed tomography-based anatomic data were combined with postural data and specimen-specific anatomy of muscle attachment points to estimate the muscle length changes associated with FHP.\nResults: Forward head posture was associated with flexion of the mid-lower cervical spine and extension of the upper cervical (sub-occipital) spine. Muscles that insert on the cervical spine and function as flexors (termed \"cervical flexors\") as well as muscles that insert on the cranium and function as extensors (\"occipital extensors\") shortened in FHP when compared to neutral posture. In contrast, muscles that insert on the cervical spine and function as extensors (\"cervical extensors\") as well as muscles that insert on the cranium and function as flexors (\"occipital flexors\") lengthened. The greatest shortening was seen in the major and minor rectus capitis posterior muscles. These muscles cross the Occiput-C2 segments, which exhibited extension to maintain horizontal gaze. The greatest lengthening was seen in posterior muscles crossing the C4-C6 segments, which exhibited the most flexion.\nLimitations: This cadaver study did not incorporate the biomechanical influence of active musculature.\nConclusions: This study offers a novel way to quantify postural alignment and muscle length changes associated with FHP. Model predictions are consistent with qualitative descriptions in the literature."

Retrospective survey: sound patency of 7 kHz band noise via the ET was assessed by comparison of acoustic transfer function via the ET in the sitting and forward-bending positions. Sound patency via the ET was compared with morphological patency of the ET (cross-sectional area in the narrowest portion) assessed by three-dimensional CT of the ET in the sitting position. Model experiment: effect of the ET caliber on the acoustic transfer function was examined using a simple model constructed with two truncated syringes with silicone barrels and a narrow connecting tube.\nResults: Sound patency assessed by sonotubometry was well correlated with the cross-sectional area at the narrowest portion of the ET in the sitting position (r = 0.786, p < 0.001). Correlation between the sound patency via the narrow tube and the caliber of the tube was also confirmed by the model experiment.\nConclusions: Sound patency assessed by sonotubometry using 7 kHz band noise could be useful to predict the morphological severity of patulous ET."

  "abstract": "Introduction: Many countries have developed their own airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) systems for use in surveying their territorial sky in real time. However, a review of the literature suggests that no studies have been conducted to analyze the cervical spine of pilots and air-controllers of AEW&C aircraft.\nMethods: The study subjects were 80 pilots and air-controllers of AEW&C aircraft with a period of service of > 1 yr and had data on physical examinations, simple radiographs and functional scores of the axial skeleton, and questionnaires about lifestyle and working conditions. Information about physical characteristics and experience of neck pain were collected. Functional scores including the neck disability index and short-form 36-item health survey were obtained. Radiological measurements were performed for the C2-7 Cobb angle and degree of forward head posture.\nResults: Of the 80 subjects, 33 (41.3%) had experienced neck pain and 63 (78.8%) had impaired cervical lordosis. The results of functional and radiological evaluations were not significantly different between pilots and air-controllers. In multivariate analysis, only the age was significantly related to the occurrence of impaired cervical lordosis. However, there were no significant factors related to the occurrence of neck pain.\nDiscussion: The results of this study suggest that the working environment of pilots and air-controllers of AEW&C aircraft has a negative effect on their cervical spine. Age seemed to be the most significant factor affecting the occurrence of impaired cervical lordosis in these subjects.Shin YH, Yun C, Han AH.

Inter-rater agreement was almost perfect (ICC≥0.81) for four measures and substantial (0.60<ICC≤0.80) for three measures during the fully clothed exam. During the minimally clothed exam, inter-rater agreement was almost perfect for four measures and substantial for four measures. Intra-rater agreement between two minimally clothed exams was almost perfect for two measures and substantial for five measures. [Conclusion] PSM is a widely available, inexpensive postural screening tool that requires little formal training. To maximize inter- and intra-rater agreement, postural screening using this mobile application should be conducted with subjects wearing minimal clothing. Assessing static standing posture via PSM gives repeatable measures for anatomical landmarks that were found to have substantial or almost perfect agreement. Our data also suggest that this technology may also be useful for diagnosing forward head posture."

  "date": "2017 Jan",
  "abstract": "Background: Myofascial Trigger points (MTrPs) may be caused or aggravated by many factors, such as mental stress associated with exams and impaired posture.\nAim: To compare the prevalence and sensitivity of MTrPs, and forward head position (FHP) during exam period vs. mid-semester among physical therapy students.\nMethods: 39 physical therapy students were palpated for MTrPs in neck and shoulder muscles and were photographed laterally for FHP measurement during the academic semester and during the academic examination period.\nResults: The subjects showed higher prevalence of active MTrPs in the right Trapezius and Levator Scapula muscles, and higher prevalence of latent MTrPs in the left Sternocleidomastoideus and Levator Scapula muscles during exams, as well as a higher rate of tenderness in suboccipital musculature.\nConclusions: Physical therapy students show greater prevalence of MTrPs during exams. The authors recommend implementing preventative programs towards the examination period."

  "date": "2017 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Effective sensorimotor integration is essential to modulate (adapt) neck stabilization strategies in response to varying tasks and disturbances. This study evaluates the hypothesis that relative to healthy controls cervical dystonia patients have an impaired ability to modulate afferent feedback for neck stabilization with changes in the frequency content of mechanical perturbations.\nMethods: We applied anterior-posterior displacement perturbations (110s) on the torso of seated subjects, while recording head-neck kinematics and muscular activity. We compared low bandwidth (0.2-1.2Hz) and high bandwidth (0.2-8Hz) perturbations where our previous research showed a profound modulation of stabilization strategies in healthy subjects. Cervical dystonia patients and age matched controls performed two tasks: (1) maintain head forward posture and (2) allow dystonia to dictate head posture.\nFindings: Patients and controls demonstrated similar kinematic and muscular responses. Patient modulation was similar to that of healthy controls (P>0.05); neck stiffness and afferent feedback decreased with high bandwidth perturbations. During the head forward task patients had an increased neck stiffness relative to controls (P<0.05), due to increased afferent feedback.\nInterpretation: The unaffected modulation of head-neck stabilization (both kinematic and muscular) in patients with cervical dystonia does not support the hypothesis of impaired afferent feedback modulation for neck stabilization."

  "title": "Pelvic posture and kinematics in femoroacetabular impingement: a systematic review",
  "date": "2017 Sep",
  "abstract": "Background: Pelvic posture and kinematics influence acetabular orientation and are therefore expected to be involved in the pathomechanics of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). This systematic review aims to determine whether FAI patients show pelvic postures or patterns of motion contributing to impingement or, conversely, develop compensatory postures and patterns of motion preventing it.\nMaterials and methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched to find all the studies that measured pelvic positional and/or kinematic data in humans (patients or cadaveric specimens) affected by FAI.\nResults: Twelve items were selected and grouped according to the main field of investigation. No quantitative data synthesis was allowed due to methodological heterogeneity. Pelvic posture and kinematics seem to play a relevant role in FAI. The patients, especially if symptomatic, show a paradoxical lack of pelvic back tilt in standing hip flexions, i.e., in squatting, that enhances femoroacetabular engagement. Such an aberrant pattern might depend on a lower pelvic incidence. On the contrary, active hip flexion in decubitus elicits a compensatory, more pronounced back tilt to facilitate hip flexion without impingement. Stair climbing shows a compensatory pattern of augmented pelvic axial rotation and augmented peak forward tilt to reduce painful hip motions, namely internal rotation and extension.\nConclusion: In FAI patients, pelvic posture and kinematics are sometimes an expression of compensatory mechanisms developed to reduce pain and discomfort, and sometimes an expression of paradoxical responses that further enhance the impingement pathomechanism.\nLevel of evidence: IV."

A secondary purpose was to examine the relationship between pedometer-determined ambulatory activity and balance. Forty-six older adults aged 73.7 ± 6.2 years participated in the study. Participants completed the Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) Scale and completed a 2-week daily step recording to determine average steps taken per day. Low-level activity participants (<5,000 steps/day) were significantly different from the high-level activity participants (>7,500 steps/day) in weight, age, and the number of medications reported. Males performed better than females on the two-footed jump test and reactive postural test FAB assessments. High-level activity participants performed significantly better than low-level activity participants on all FAB assessments except stand with feet together and eyes closed, reach forward to object, and walk with head turns."

  "date": "2016",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Whiplash injuries to the cervical spine represent a considerable economic burden on society with medical conditions, in some cases persisting for more than a year. Numerous studies of whiplash injuries have been made for occupant normal seated position, leaving the analysis of neck injuries for out-of-normal positions not well documented. For that purpose, a detailed human cervical spine finite element model was developed.\nMethods: The analysis was made for four most common occupant seated positions, such as: Normal Position with the torso against the seat back and the head looking straight ahead, Torso Lean forward position with the torso away from the seat back for approximately 10°, Head Flexed position with the head flexed forward approximately 20° from the normal position and Head-Flexed with Torso Lean forward position with the head flexed forward approximately 20° and torso 10° from the normal position.\nResults: The comparative study included the analysis of capsular ligament deformation and the level of S-curvature of the cervical spine. The model developed predicted that Head Flexed seated position and Head-Flexed with Torso Lean forward seated position are most threatening for upper and lower cervical spine capsular ligament, respectively. As for the level of S-curvature, the model predicted that Head-Flexed with Torso Lean forward seated position would be most prone to neck injuries associated with it.\nConclusions: This study demonstrated that the occupant seated position has a significant influence on potential whiplash injuries."

  "abstract": "Emergency events can influence a child's kinematics prior to a car-crash, and thus its interaction with the restraint system. Numerical Human Body Models (HBMs) can help understand the behaviour of children in emergency events. The kinematic responses of two child HBMs-MADYMO 6 and 10 year-old models-were evaluated and compared with child volunteers' data during emergency events-braking and steering-with a focus on the forehead and sternum displacements. The response of the 6 year-old HBM was similar to the response of the 10 year-old HBM, however both models had a different response compared with the volunteers. The forward and lateral displacements were within the range of volunteer data up to approximately 0.3 s; but then, the HBMs head and sternum moved significantly downwards, while the volunteers experienced smaller displacement and tended to come back to their initial posture. Therefore, these HBMs, originally intended for crash simulations, are not too stiff and could be able to reproduce properly emergency events thanks, for instance, to postural control."

  "date": "2017 Jan 1",
  "abstract": "Context: Rectus capitis posterior (RCP) muscles have physical attachments to the pain-sensitive spinal dura. Atrophy of these muscles is associated with chronic headache in some patients. The authors suspect that the significance of atrophy in the RCP muscles has been undervalued because the functional role of these muscles is not well defined.\nObjective: To determine whether a statistically significant change in normalized levels of electromyographic activity in RCP muscles occurs when the head is voluntarily moved from a self-selected neutral head position to a protruded head position.\nMethods: Fine wire, intramuscular electrodes were used to collect electromyographic data as asymptomatic participants moved their head from a neutral head position into a forward head position and back into the neutral head position. This sequence was repeated 4 times. Normalized levels of electromyographic activity were quantified using a 2-head position × 2 sides of the body repeated measures design that incorporated mixed-effects β regression models.\nResults: Twenty participants were studied. Electromyographic activity collected from RCP muscles was found to increase as the head was voluntarily moved from a self-selected neutral head position (11% of maximum voluntary isometric contraction [MVIC] in RCP minor, 14% of MVIC in RCP major) into a protruded head position (35% of MVIC in RCP minor, 39% of MVIC in RCP major) (P<.001).\nConclusion: Rectus capitis posterior muscles may contribute to segmental stabilization of the occipitoatlantal and atlantoaxial joints by helping to maintain joint congruency during movement of the head."

  "title": "Effects of Real-World Versus Virtual Environments on Joint Excursions in Full-Body Reaching Tasks",
  "date": "2016 Nov 4",
  "abstract": "Starting from an upright standing posture and reaching for a target that requires some forward bending of the trunk can involve many different configurations of the trunk and limb segments. We sought to determine if configurations of the limb and trunk segments during our standardized full-body reaching tasks were influenced by the visual environment. This paper examined movement patterns of healthy participants ([Formula: see text], eight female and nine male) performing full body reaching tasks to: 1) real-world targets; 2) virtual targets presented on a 3-D television; and 3) virtual targets presented using a head-mounted display. For reaches performed in the virtual world, the avatar was presented from a third-person perspective for the 3-D television and from a first-person perspective for the head-mounted display. Reaches to virtual targets resulted in significantly greater excursions of the ankle, knee, hip, spine, and shoulder compared with reaches made to real-world targets. This resulted in significant differences in the forward and downward displacements of the whole-body center of mass between the visual environments. Visual environment clearly influences how subjects perform full-body reaching tasks to static targets. Because a primary goal of virtual reality within rehabilitation is often to restore movement following orthopedic or neurologic injury, it is important to understand how visual environment will affect motor behavior. The present findings suggest that the existing game systems that track and present avatars from a third-person perspective elicit significantly different motor behavior when compared with the same tasks being presented from a first-person perspective."

No significant differences were found for scapular posture between groups.\nConclusions: This study suggests that children and adolescents who play the accordion have an increased forward head posture and lumbar lordosis and a tendency to report more pain than children and adolescents who do not play a musical instrument. Results corroborate the need for including healthy preventive teaching-learning strategies at music conservatoires."

[Subjects and Methods] Craniovertebral angle and cranial rotation angle were measured with 24 patients who were diagnosed with forward head posture. The experimental group conducted bodyblade exercise for 6 weeks and all patients received conventional physical therapy. The craniovertebral angle and cranial rotation angle were measured using a diagnostic imaging device to measure the change in forward head posture. Sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius and serratus anterior muscle activity were measured using surface electromyography, voluntary contraction was converting into a percentage and mean value was calculated. [Results] The experimental group showed a significant increase in the comparison of the results of both groups before and after the intervention. The comparing group showed no significant difference. The experimental group showed the significant difference in mean value after the intervention in the comparison between the groups. [Conclusion] Resistant vibration stimulus by bodyblade controlled shoulder muscle activity causing scapular stabilization followed by neck position stability improvement. Rehabilitation program that activates whole kinetic chain of proximal and distal muscles such as bodyblade will show more effective improvement when choosing rehabilitation program for neck and shoulder disease clinically."

  "date": "2016 Dec",
  "abstract": "Background: Subacromial impingement is a common condition among overhead athletes. The cause of subacromial impingement can be multifactorial and often involves impaired rotator cuff function.\nCase description: The following cases outline the presentation, examination and intervention of two overhead athletes, a high school football quarterback and a collegiate swimmer, each presenting with signs and symptoms of subacromial impingement. The unique feature in each case was the manifestation of the cervical spine as the apparent source of rotator cuff weakness, which contributed to functional subacromial impingement although other overt signs of cervical or associated nerve root involvement were absent.\nOutcome: Subsequent to this finding, the athletes demonstrated a rapid recovery of rotator cuff strength and resolution of impingement symptoms in response to cervical retraction and retraction with extension range of motion exercises along with posture correction. They both returned to unrestricted sporting activities within a week, with maintenance of strength and without reoccurrence of symptoms.\nDiscussion: The signs of functional subacromial impingement often include weakness of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the weakness in the two cases appeared to be the result of stresses associated with forward head posture contributing to a possible intermittent C5 nerve root compression. The findings in the two cases would suggest the cervical spine should be considered as a potential cause of rotator cuff weakness in individuals presenting with subacromial impingement. Future research should examine the influence of cervical postures and shoulder muscle strength.\nLevel of evidence: 4."

  "title": "How Do I Examine Postural Disorders in Parkinson's Disease?",
  "date": "2016 Nov 25",
  "abstract": "Postural abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) are considered the rule more than the exception and are disabling complications of the disease. These deformities include camptocormia, antecollis, Pisa syndrome, and scoliosis. Evidence to date suggests that postural deformities have a multifactorial pathophysiology, including muscular rigidity, axial dystonia, weakness due to myopathy, body scheme defects due to centrally impaired proprioception, and structural changes in the spine. Antecollis in parkinsonian disorders refers to a forward flexion of the head and neck. It is usually mild in severity and may be considered part of the stooped posture in patients with PD. Some authors that suggest the term antecollis should only be used in patients with at least a minimum of 45 degrees of thoracolumbar flexion. Neither camptocormia nor Pisa syndrome can be evaluated without taking into account the presence or absence of scoliosis. In this regard, the rotating component of the spine and its behavior in the supine position give important clues for a correct diagnosis. In some cases, X-rays in the standing and supine positions are necessary. The presence of marked camptocormia requires a minimum of flexion in the sagittal plane originating in the thoracolumbar spine greater than 45 degrees, with an almost complete resolution in the supine position. Pisa syndrome requires a minimum of 10 degrees of lateral flexion and is almost completely alleviated by passive mobilization or supine positioning. A certain degree of scoliosis is expected in most parkinsonian patients; therefore, both camptocormia and Pisa syndrome do not generally present as pure syndromes."

  "abstract": "Objectives: Aging is associated with cognitive decline, including visuomotor and memory concerns, and with motor system changes, including gait slowing and stooped posture. We investigated the associations of visuomotor performance and episodic memory with motor system characteristics in healthy older adults. Methods: Neurologically healthy older adults (N = 160, aged 50-89) completed a battery of cognitive and motor tasks. Cognitive variables were grouped by principal components analysis (PCA) into two components: visuomotor performance and verbal episodic memory. Our primary predictor variables were two aspects of motor function: timed-up-and-go (TUG) speed and neck angle. Additional predictor variables included demographic factors (age, sex and education) and indicators of physical fitness (body mass index/BMI and grip strength). All seven predictor variables were entered stepwise into a multiple regression model for each cognitive component. Results: Poor visuomotor performance was best predicted by a combination of advanced age, high BMI and slow TUG, whereas poor verbal memory performance was best predicted by a combination of advanced age, male sex, low education and acute neck angle. Conclusions: Upright posture and mobility were associated with different cognitive processes, suggesting different underlying neural mechanisms. These results provide the first evidence for a link between postural alignment and cognitive functioning in healthy older adults. Possible causal relationships are discussed."

Both groups were compared to controls (n = 26). All participants underwent postural assessment by biophotogrammetry. Cases alone underwent blood collection. The significance level was set at 5%, and analyses were carried out in SPSS 18.0.\nResults: In the early-stage group, 15 postural angles were significantly different from their reference ranges, whereas in the late-stage group, only seven angles were significantly different. In comparison with the control group, only six angles were significantly different. There was no difference in inflammation markers between the early- and late-stage groups. However, CRP levels were higher in cases with greater disease severity, and vWF was associated with forward head posture. Pain correlated with five postural angles, and late-stage patients reported more pain than early-stage cases.\nConclusions: CRP was associated with disease severity, while vWF and pain were associated with forward head posture, hyperlordosis and scoliosis, suggesting an association between vascular inflammation and pain, with an influence on posture."

  "abstract": "Purpose: Head postural assessment is part of the orthopaedic physical examination process and could help to identify faulty head postures. One of the most common faulty postures of the craniocervical region is the forward head posture (FHP). There are several methods to evaluate FHP but it is not clear which method is more precise. The aim of this study was to compare the craniovertebral angle (CVA) between a FHP and a healthy group in sitting and standing positions.\nMethods: Twenty-five subjects with FHP (22.9 ± 2 years) and 25 normal subjects (21.9 ± 5 years) participated in this case-control study. Photography of the sagittal view was done in standing and relaxed sitting postures to determine the amount of the FHP.\nResults: The results of independent t test showed a significant difference in the CVA between the FHP and healthy groups (P < 0.001). The result of paired t test showed a significant difference between CVA in standing and sitting postures for both groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the BMI had a significant negative correlation with CVA in standing position (P < 0.01).\nConclusions: Our results indicated that the CVA was increased in the sitting posture compared to the standing posture and introduced the standing posture as a more sensitive posture to evaluate the FHP."

  "date": "2016 Dec",
  "abstract": "Background: Evidence is growing that computer users are at increased risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders, particularly those involving the upper extremity, with significant financial cost and lost productivity.\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term effects of wearing a dynamic elastic garment (Posture Shirt[Formula: see text]; AlignMed, USA) on musculoskeletal wellness and health in the computer workplace.\nMethods: Ninety-six computer users were evaluated. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire was completed. A functional assessment of posture, lung function, and grip strength was performed after wearing the Posture Shirt[Formula: see text] for 4 weeks. A training log was kept to track usage of the garment, as well as weekly sensations of fatigue, productivity, and energy level.\nResults: After 4 weeks, there was statistically significant improvement in forward shoulder and head posture, thoracic kyphosis, and grip strength. Improvements in spirometry measures did not meet statistical significance. Postural fatigue and muscular fatigue decreased by 21% and 29%, respectively, and energy level and productivity increased by 20% and 13%, respectively.\nConclusion: This prospective study demonstrated positive short-term impact of the Posture Shirt[Formula: see text] on both subjective and objective measures of posture, lung function, grip strength, fatigue, and productivity."

  "date": "2016 Sep 30",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study investigates the impact of isometric contraction of anterior cervical muscles on cervical lordosis.\nMethods: 29 volunteers were randomly assigned to an anterior head translation (n=15) or anterior head flexion (n=14) group. Resting neutral lateral cervical x-rays were compared to x-rays of sustained isometric contraction of the anterior cervical muscles producing anterior head translation or anterior head flexion.\nResults: Paired sample t-tests indicate no significant difference between pre and post anterior head translation or anterior head flexion. Analysis of variance suggests that gender and peak force were not associated with change in cervical lordosis. Chamberlain's to atlas plane line angle difference was significantly associated with cervical lordosis difference during anterior head translation (p=0.01).\nConclusion: This study shows no evidence that hypertonicity, as seen in muscle spasms, of the muscles responsible for anterior head translation and anterior head flexion have a significant impact on cervical lordosis."

  "date": "2016 Nov",
  "abstract": "Background: Subacromial space distance and forward head and shoulder posture are common characteristics resulting from swim training. These alterations can cause abnormal scapular kinematics and positioning, potentially increasing compression of structures in the subacromial space and increasing the risk for the development of swimmer's shoulder.\nPurpose: To evaluate the effect of the swim training season on subacromial space distance and forward head and forward shoulder posture as well as to determine the relationship between these variables.\nStudy design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.\nMethods: Included in the study were 43 competitive adolescent swimmers and 29 nonoverhead adolescent athletes (controls) who were not currently experiencing any shoulder, neck, or back pain that limited their participation in sports activity. All participants were evaluated 3 times: once before the start of the swim training season and then at 2 follow-up sessions 6 and 12 weeks after the initial testing session. At each testing session, each participant completed a physical examination that included evaluation of posture and subacromial space distance.\nResults: Swimmers had significantly greater decreases in subacromial space distance during the training season compared with nonoverhead athletes. Swimmers also demonstrated significantly greater increases in forward shoulder posture compared with nonoverhead athletes. A significant relationship was noted between changes in forward shoulder posture and changes in subacromial space distance from the baseline testing session to the assessment 6 weeks after baseline assessment. As forward shoulder posture increased, subacromial space significantly decreased.\nConclusion: Because of their training load, swimmers experience a decrease in subacromial space distance and an increase in forward shoulder posture over the course of 12 weeks of training, potentially making these athletes more vulnerable to the development of shoulder pain and injury."

Corrective techniques such as manual therapy and exercise have been shown to improve these altered postures, but there is little evidence that corrective garments such as posture shirts can alter posture.\nObjectives: To determine the acute effects of corrective postureshirt use on rounded-shoulder and forward-head posture in asymptomatic college students.\nDesign: Repeated-measures intervention study with counterbalanced conditions.\nSetting: Research laboratory.\nParticipants: 24 members of the general student body of a university, 18-25 y old, with a forward shoulder angle (FSA) >52° and no history of upper-extremity surgery, scoliosis, active shoulder pain, or shoulder pain in the previous 3 mo that restricted participation for 3 consecutive days.\nInterventions: Photographic posture assessment under a control condition, under a sham or treatment condition (counterbalanced), under another control condition, and treatment or sham.\nMain outcome measures: FSA and forward head angle (FHA) calculated from a lateral photograph.\nResults: FSA decreased relative to the control condition while participants wore the sham shirt (P = .029) but not the corrective posture shirt (P = 1.00). FHA was unchanged between groups (P = .371).\nConclusions: Application of a corrective posture shirt did not acutely alter FSA or FHA, while application of a sham shirt may decrease FSA at rest."

The ratio of forward head position during habitual sitting to the maximum head-protraction differed significantly (p = 0.046) between headache-group (1.4 ± 0.4) and the control-group (1.1 ± 0.2). The headache-group showed a biphasic forward head position and head-tilt profile. These profiles differed significantly (p < 0.05) between groups and were negatively correlated (rE = -0.927).\nConclusion: The headache-group showed a larger passive head-protraction with a habitual forward head-position further located from the end-range. During the laptop-task forward head position and head-tilt behaved biphasically with a more static forward head position and a more dynamic head-tilt."

  "abstract": "Background: Musculoskeletal disorders are common problems among dentists. These conditions may lead to inappropriate postures and impairment in physical and psychological function. On the other hand, poor postures and inappropriate ergonomic may result in a wide variety of musculoskeletal disorders.\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of common postural disorders of the spine and shoulder girdle among the dentists and possible correlations between demographic, anthropometric and occupational characteristics with these abnormal postures.\nPatients and methods: In a cross-sectional study, 96 dental staff including academic staff, residents and senior students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences was enrolled. Data were collected using a questionnaire and posture assessment tools such as plumb-line, checkerboard and flexible ruler. Data analysis was done with SPSS version 17.\nResults: The prevalence of the forward head posture (FHP), rounded shoulder posture (RSP), scoliosis and hyperlordosis were reported in 85.5%, 68.8%, 18.8% and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. A significant correlation was found between gender and FHP (P = 0.04) and also scoliosis (P = 0.009). On the other hand, a significant correlation was seen between weight and hyperlordosis (P = 0.007).\nConclusions: Our study revealed a high prevalence of postural disorders especially FHP, RSP and scoliosis among Iranian dental staff. The female dentists were less susceptible to FHP and scoliosis."

We compared CCA & TKA and trunk extensor muscle activity between with and without application of the craniocervical brace during visual display terminal work.\nResults: When wearing the craniocervical brace, the subjects demonstrated significantly greater CCA at the start and the end of the task and less change in CCA during the task (p < 0.05). While non-significantly less TKA was seen at the start of the task, significantly less TKA was observed at the end of the task when using the craniocervical brace (p < 0.05). The craniocervical brace use also led to significantly less change in TKA (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the trunk extensor muscle activity.\nConclusions: Use of the craniocervical brace decreased FHP immediately, lessened thoracic kyphosis over time, and prevented the worsening of FHP and thoracic kyphosis during visual display terminal work."

  "title": "The direction of the postural response to a vestibular perturbation is mediated by the cerebellar vermis",
  "date": "2016 Dec",
  "abstract": "When an electrical stimulus is applied to perturb the vestibular system, a postural response is generated orthogonal to head orientation. It has previously been shown that there is a convergence of neck proprioceptive and vestibular input within the cerebellum to provide a head-on-body reference frame (Manzoni et al. in Neuroscience 93:1095-1107, 1999). The objective of this experiment was to determine whether the direction of the postural response to a vestibular perturbation is modulated when function of the cerebellar vermis is temporarily depressed. Twenty participants were randomly assigned to a SHAM group (paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation) or a TEST group (continuous theta burst stimulation). Stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) was applied to standing subjects with their head facing forward or over their left shoulder. Cumulant density traces were established between the SVS and shear force over 180°, and the peak amplitude determined the direction of sway. There were no significant changes in sway direction when the head was facing forward for either stimulation (TEST or SHAM; p = 0.889) or when the head was facing over the shoulder for the SHAM condition (p = 0.954). There was, however, a significant change in sway direction when the head was turned with a depressed cerebellum (p = 0.018); from the expected antero-posterior direction, orthogonal to head orientation, to one slightly more mediolateral with respect to the feet. These results suggest the cerebellum plays a role in the integration of input to generate an appropriately directed postural response relative to the head position."

  "title": "Naturalistic driving study of rear seat child occupants: Quantification of head position using a Kinect™ sensor",
  "date": "2016 Sep",
  "abstract": "Objective: Restraint performance is evaluated using anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) positioned in prescribed, optimal seating positions. Anecdotally, humans-children in particular-assume a variety of positions that may affect restraint performance. Naturalistic driving studies (NDSs), where cameras and other data acquisition systems are placed in a vehicle used by participants during their regular transportation, offer means to collect these data. To date, these studies have used conventional video and analysis methods and, thus, analyses have largely been qualitative. This article describes a recently completed NDS of child occupants in which their position was monitored using a Kinect sensor to quantify their head position throughout normal, everyday driving trips.\nMethods: A study vehicle was instrumented with a data acquisition system to measure vehicle dynamics, a set of video cameras, and a Kinect sensor providing 3D motion capture at 1 Hz of the rear seat occupants. Participant families used the vehicle for all driving trips over 2 weeks. The child occupants' head position was manually identified via custom software from each Kinect color image. The 3D head position was then extracted and its distribution summarized by seat position (left, rear, center) and restraint type (forward-facing child restraint system [FFCRS], booster seat, seat belt).\nResults: Data from 18 families (37 child occupants) resulted in 582 trips (with children) for analysis. The average age of the child occupants was 45.6 months and 51% were male. Twenty-five child occupants were restrained in FFCRS, 9 in booster seats, and 3 in seat belts. As restraint type moved from more to less restraint (FFCRS to booster seat to seat belt), the range of fore-aft head position increased: 218, 244, and 340 mm on average, respectively. This observation was also true for left-right movement for every seat position. In general, those in the center seat position demonstrated a smaller range of head positions.\nConclusions: For the first time in a naturalistic setting, the range of head positions for child occupants was quantified. More variability was observed for those restrained in booster seats and seat belts than for those in FFCRS. The role of activities, in particular interactions with electronic devices, on head position was notable; this will be the subject of further analysis in other components of the broader study. These data can lead to solutions for optimal protection for occupants who assume positions that differ from prescribed, optimal testing positions."

  "abstract": "Background: There is limited evidence regarding interactions between pulmonary (dys)function, posture, and mobility of the upper body quadrant in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nObjectives: This exploratory study aimed to investigate whether postural alignment and mobility of the upper quadrant are related to changes in pulmonary function and compare such variables between patients with COPD and healthy individuals.\nMethod: Fifteen patients with COPD (67.93±9.71yrs) and 15 healthy controls (66.80±7.47yrs) participated. Pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC) was assessed with spirometry. Alignment and mobility of the head, thoracic spine, and shoulder were assessed using digital photographs. Pectoralis minor muscle (PmM) length and thoracic excursion were assessed with a measuring tape. Groups were compared and linear regression analyses were used to assess potential relationships between postural and mobility variables and pulmonary function.\nResults: Patients with COPD were more likely to have a forward head position at maximal protraction (28.81±7.30º vs. 35.91±8.56º, p=0.02) and overall mobility of the head (21.81±10.42º vs. 13.40±7.84º, p=0.02) and a smaller range of shoulder flexion (136.71±11.91º vs. 149.08±11.58º, p=0.01) than controls. Patients' non-dominant PmM length and maximal head protraction were predictors of FEV1 (r2adjusted=0.34). These variables, together with the upper thoracic spine at maximal flexion and thoracic kyphosis at maximal extension, were predictors of FVC (r2adjusted=0.68).\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that impaired pulmonary function is associated with muscle length and mobility adaptations. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and clinical value of these relationships."

  "abstract": "[Purpose] This study compared the effects of pilates and an exercise program on the craniovertebral angle, cervical range of motion, pain, and muscle fatigue in subjects with a forward head posture (FHP). [Subjects and Methods] A total of 28 sedentary females (age 20 to 39 years) with FHP were randomly assigned to pilates (n=14) and combined (n=14) exercise groups. The study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind study with the two groups performing exercise 50 min/day, 3 days/week, with an intensity of 11-15 rating of perceived exertion (RPE) for ten weeks. The main outcome measures were craniovertebral angle, cervical range of motion (ROM), pain levels assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), and neck disability index (NDI). Surface electromyography was also used to measure muscle fatigue. [Results] There were significant increases in craniovertebral angle and cervical ROM in the pilates group, but none in the control group. The only significant differences in muscle activity were recorded in the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the pilates group. Both exercise programs had positive effects on pain measures, as VAS and NDI were significantly decreased. [Conclusion] The results suggest that pilates could be recommended as an appropriate exercise for treatment of FHP in sedentary individuals."

  "title": "An evaluation of 3D head pose estimation using the Microsoft Kinect v2",
  "date": "2016 Jul",
  "abstract": "The Kinect v2 sensor supports real-time non-invasive 3D head pose estimation. Because the sensor is small, widely available and relatively cheap it has great potential as a tool for groups interested in measuring head posture. In this paper we compare the Kinect's head pose estimates with a marker-based record of ground truth in order to establish its accuracy. During movement of the head and neck alone (with static torso), we find average errors in absolute yaw, pitch and roll angles of 2.0±1.2°, 7.3±3.2° and 2.6±0.7°, and in rotations relative to the rest pose of 1.4±0.5°, 2.1±0.4° and 2.0±0.8°. Larger head rotations where it becomes difficult to see facial features can cause estimation to fail (10.2±6.1% of all poses in our static torso range of motion tests) but we found no significant changes in performance with the participant standing further away from Kinect - additionally enabling full-body pose estimation - or without performing face shape calibration, something which is not always possible for younger or disabled participants. Where facial features remain visible, the sensor has applications in the non-invasive assessment of postural control, e.g. during a programme of physical therapy. In particular, a multi-Kinect setup covering the full range of head (and body) movement would appear to be a promising way forward."

  "abstract": "Background: Passenger comfort is a key variable in user acceptance of transportation systems. The back rest of a seat is of importance part in this experience. In designing a backrest, information of the human contour is useful as the product can be formed following this contour. The question is whether there is too much variation due to variety in tasks or in human anthropometry to design a back rest.\nObjective: The research question is whether anthropometric properties and the performed activity have an influence on the back contour of a person.\nMethods: The head, neck and back contour of a human sitting in an aircraft seat are estimated by using a kyphometer. In total 46 subjects are measured in two different chairs, when performing two different activities.\nResults: This research indicates that the maximum variation of the contours occur on the upper back, neck and head. These parts are more bended forward when using a laptop compared with watching IFE. By dividing the data in groups, based on buttock-top of head distance, the height at which significant differences between the groups occur was determined. For one seat 400 mm above the seat pan a significant difference was found and for the other seat this was 420 mm above the seat pan.\nConclusions: Differences in back contour started to appear above 400 mm vertical distance from the seat pan, which means that the design of a seat should facilitate this variation."

  "title": "Head movement during walking in the cat",
  "date": "2016 Sep 22",
  "abstract": "Knowledge of how the head moves during locomotion is essential for understanding how locomotion is controlled by sensory systems of the head. We have analyzed head movements of the cat walking along a straight flat pathway in the darkness and light. We found that cats' head left-right translations, and roll and yaw rotations oscillated once per stride, while fore-aft and vertical translations, and pitch rotations oscillated twice. The head reached its highest vertical positions during second half of each forelimb swing, following maxima of the shoulder/trunk by 20-90°. Nose-up rotation followed head upward translation by another 40-90° delay. The peak-to-peak amplitude of vertical translation was ∼1.5cm and amplitude of pitch rotation was ∼3°. Amplitudes of lateral translation and roll rotation were ∼1cm and 1.5-3°, respectively. Overall, cats' heads were neutral in roll and 10-30° nose-down, maintaining horizontal semicircular canals and utriculi within 10° of the earth horizontal. The head longitudinal velocity was 0.5-1m/s, maximal upward and downward linear velocities were ∼0.05 and ∼0.1m/s, respectively, and maximal lateral velocity was ∼0.05m/s. Maximal velocities of head pitch rotation were 20-50°/s. During walking in light, cats stood 0.3-0.5cm taller and held their head 0.5-2cm higher than in darkness. Forward acceleration was 25-100% higher and peak-to-peak amplitude of head pitch oscillations was ∼20°/s larger. We concluded that, during walking, the head of the cat is held actively. Reflexes appear to play only a partial role in determining head movement, and vision might further diminish their role."

  "date": "2016 Oct",
  "abstract": "Background: Forward head posture is a head-on-trunk malalignment, which results in musculoskeletal dysfunction and neck pain. To improve forward head posture, both the craniocervical flexion exercise and the suboccipital release technique have been used.\nObjectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the immediate effects of craniocervical flexion exercise and suboccipital release combined with craniocervical flexion exercise on craniovertebral angle, cervical flexion and extension range of motion, and the muscle activities of the sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene, and splenius capitis during craniocervical flexion exercise in subjects with forward head posture.\nMethods: In total, 19 subjects (7 males, 12 females) with forward head posture were recruited using G-power software. Each subject performed craniocervical flexion exercise and suboccipital release combined with craniocervical flexion exercise in random order. After one intervention was performed, the subject took a 20min wash out period to minimize any carry-over effect between interventions. Craniovertebral angle, cervical flexion and extension range of motion, and the muscle activities of the sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene, and splenius capitis were measured. A one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA was used to assess differences between the effects of the craniocervical flexion exercise and suboccipital release combined with craniocervical flexion exercise interventions in the same group.\nResults: Craniovertebral angle (p<0.05), cervical flexion range of motion (p<0.05), and cervical extension range of motion (p<0.001) were significantly greater after suboccipital release combined with craniocervical flexion exercise compared to craniocervical flexion exercise alone. The muscle activities of the sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene, and splenius capitis were significantly lower during suboccipital release combined with craniocervical flexion exercise than during craniocervical flexion exercise alone across all craniocervical flexion exercise phases except the first (all p<0.05).\nConclusion: The addition of suboccipital release to craniocervical flexion exercise provided superior benefits relative to craniocervical flexion exercise alone as an intervention for subjects with forward head posture."

  "date": "2016 Oct",
  "abstract": "Background context: Flexible dropped head deformity (FDHD) following laminectomy for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a debilitating entity. Patients need to support their head manually to look forward in standing or sitting position. Flexible dropped head deformity is different from rigid dropped head deformity in patients with post-laminectomy kyphosis or ankylosing spondylitis and has only once been described after surgery to the cervical spine.\nPurpose: This case report aimed to report a rare, but severe complication of cervical posterior decompressive surgery, to describe its possible etiology, and to review the literature on the management of FDHD in order to provide recommendations for its treatment.\nStudy design: This is a retrospective clinical case series.\nPatient sample: This sample comprises four patients with FDHD.\nMethods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts with clinical follow-up data of all patients who underwent posteriorly directed spinal interventions and concomitantly developed FDHD and were admitted between January 1998 and September 2015.\nResults: Cervical decompressive laminectomy is regularly performed in our institution. Four patients with FDHD were identified (3 men and 1 woman). The overall prevalence was less than 1% (=4 of 460 total estimated CSM surgeries). Flexible dropped head deformity developed within weeks or months after surgery. One patient was treated conservatively, whereas the other three received surgery to reconstruct stability of the cervical spine. Two of the surgically corrected patients eventually required revision surgery as a result of failure of the hardware and because of skin erosion.\nConclusions: Flexible dropped head deformity is a rare, but serious complication of posterior decompressive surgery. Its etiology appears multifactorial. Its management needs to be directed toward early surgical intervention."

  "title": "Neck Posture Clusters and Their Association With Biopsychosocial Factors and Neck Pain in Australian Adolescents",
  "date": "2016 Oct",
  "abstract": "Background: There is conflicting evidence on the association between sagittal neck posture and neck pain.\nObjective: The purposes of this study were: (1) to determine the existence of clusters of neck posture in a cohort of 17-year-olds and (2) to establish whether identified subgroups were associated with biopsychosocial factors and neck pain.\nDesign: This was a cross-sectional study.\nMethods: The adolescents (N=1,108) underwent 2-dimensional photographic postural assessment in a sitting position. One distance and 4 angular measurements of the head, neck, and thorax were calculated from photo-reflective markers placed on bony landmarks. Subgroups of sagittal sitting neck posture were determined by cluster analysis. Height and weight were measured, and lifestyle and psychological factors, neck pain, and headache were assessed by questionnaire. The associations among posture subgroups, neck pain, and other factors were evaluated using logistic regression.\nResults: Four distinct clusters of sitting neck posture were identified: upright, intermediate, slumped thorax/forward head, and erect thorax/forward head. Significant associations between cluster and sex, weight, and height were found. Participants classified as having slumped thorax/forward head posture were at higher odds of mild, moderate, or severe depression. Participants classified as having upright posture exercised more frequently. There was no significant difference in the odds of neck pain or headache across the clusters.\nLimitations: The results are specific to 17-year-olds and may not be applicable to adults.\nConclusion: Meaningful sagittal sitting neck posture clusters were identified in 17-year-olds who demonstrated some differences with biopsychosocial profiling. The finding of no association between cluster membership and neck pain and headaches challenges widely held beliefs about the role of posture in adolescent neck pain."

  "title": "Visual and proprioceptive contributions to postural control of upright stance in unilateral vestibulopathy",
  "date": "2016 Jun",
  "abstract": "Preserving upright stance requires central integration of the sensory systems and appropriate motor output from the neuromuscular system to keep the centre of pressure (COP) within the base of support. Unilateral peripheral vestibular disorder (UPVD) causes diminished stance stability. The aim of this study was to determine the limits of stability and to examine the contribution of multiple sensory systems to upright standing in UPVD patients and healthy subjects. We hypothesized that closure of the eyes and Achilles tendon vibration during upright stance will augment the postural sway in UPVD patients more than in healthy subjects. Seventeen UPVD patients and 17 healthy subjects performed six tasks on a force plate: forwards and backwards leaning, to determine limits of stability, and upright standing with and without Achilles tendon vibration, each with eyes open and closed (with blackout glasses). The COP displacement of the patients was significantly greater in the vibration tasks than the controls and came closer to the posterior base of support boundary than the controls in all tasks. Achilles tendon vibration led to a distinctly more backward sway in both subject groups. Five of the patients could not complete the eyes closed with vibration task. Due to the greater reduction in stance stability when the proprioceptive, compared with the visual, sensory system was disturbed, we suggest that proprioception may be more important for maintaining upright stance than vision. UPVD patients, in particular, showed more difficulty in controlling postural stability in the posterior direction with visual and proprioceptive sensory disturbance."

  "title": "Does knee motion contribute to feet-in-place balance recovery?",
  "date": "2016 Jun 14",
  "abstract": "Although knee motions have been observed at loss of balance, the ankle and hip strategies have remained the focus of past research. The present study aimed to investigate whether knee motions contribute to feet-in-place balance recovery. This was achieved by experimentally monitoring knee motions during recovery from forward falling, and by simulating balance recovery movements with and without knee joint as the main focus of the study. Twelve participants initially held a straight body configuration and were released from different forward leaning positions. Considerable knee motions were observed especially at greater leaning angles. Simulations were performed using 3-segment (feet, shanks+thighs, and head+arms+trunk) and 4-segment (with separate shanks and thighs segments) planar models. Movements were driven by joint torque generators depending on joint angle, angular velocity, and activation level. Optimal joint motions moved the mass center projection to be within the base of support without excessive joint motion. The 3-segment model (without knee motions) generated greater backward linear momentum and had better balance performance, which confirmed the advantage of having only ankle/hip strategies. Knee motions were accompanied with less body angular momentum and a lower body posture, which could be beneficial for posture control and reducing falling impact, respectively."

[Subjects and Methods] Fifteen participants were recruited according to the selection criteria and were randomly allocated to the scapular stabilization group (n=8) and the control group (n=7). The scapular stabilization group underwent training for 30 minutes a day, 3 times a week for 4 weeks; the control group performed relaxation exercises for 4 weeks. [Results] After training the scapular stabilization group showed significant improvement on the craniovertebral angle, upper trapezius muscle activity, serratus anterior muscle activity, Neck Disability Index scores, Visual Analog Scale scores, and World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-BREF scores compared to those in the control group. [Conclusion] Scapular stabilization exercise can help improve the head posture and pain in the patients with neck pain and forward head posture. Controlling the muscular activities through scapular stabilization exercise also improves the patients' quality of life."

[Subjects and Methods] Seventy-two subjects (35 males and 37 females) participated in this study. For measurement of head posture, the craniovertebral angle was calculated based on the angle between a horizontal line passing through C7 and a line extending from the tragus of the ear to C7. The joint position sense was evaluated using a dual digital inclinometer (Acumar, Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, IN, USA), which was used to measure the joint position error for cervical flexion and extension. [Results] A significant negative correlation was observed between the craniovertebral angle and position sense error for flexion and extension. [Conclusion] Forward head posture is correlated with greater repositioning error than a more upright posture, and further research is needed to determine whether correction of forward head posture has any impact on repositioning error."

FHP is one of the most prevalent abnormal postures in patients with neck pain. The aim of the present study was to compare isometric force of the CC flexor and extensor muscles between women with and without FHP.\nMethod: Isometric force of the CC flexor and extensor muscles was measured by a custom-made device and compared between 70 women with and without FHP (35 in each group).\nResults: No significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding isometric force of the CC flexor and extensor muscles, but the ratio of the isometric force of the CC muscles (flexor to extensor) revealed significant difference between the two groups, and it was greater in the control group compared with that in the FHP group.\nDiscussion: The ratio of isometric force of the CC muscles (flexor to extensor) may be a good indicator for assessment of patients with FHP. This ratio may also be valuable to follow the results of therapeutic intervention for these patients."

Questionnaires regarding the habits of computer and mobile phone use were administrated to 429 subjects aged from 17 to 33 years old (19.75 ± 2.58 years old). Subjects were instructed to stand habitually and use a mobile phone as in daily life; the sagittal head and cervical postures were measured by head flexion, neck flexion angle and gaze angle. Male participants had a significantly larger head flexion angle (96.41° ± 12.23° vs. 93.57° ± 12.62°, p = 0.018) and neck flexion angle (51.92° ± 9.55° vs. 47.09° ± 9.45°, p < 0.001) than females. There were significant differences in head (F = 3.62, p = 0.014) and neck flexion (F = 3.99, p = 0.009) between different amounts of computer use. Practitioner Summary: We investigated possible gender differences in head and neck postures of young adults using mobile phones, as well as the potential correlations between these postures and digital device use. We found that males displayed larger head and neck flexion angles than females, which were associated with the amount of computer use."

  "date": "2016 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Axial rigidity and postural instability in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) may contribute to turning difficulty. This study examined the rotation of axial segments and gait instability during turning in people with PD.\nMethods: Thirteen PD and twelve age-matched healthy adults were recruited. Participants performed the timed Up-and-Go test and were recorded by a 3D motion capture system. Axial rotation was evaluated by the rotation onset of the head, thorax and pelvis. Gait stability was evaluated by the center of mass and center of pressure inclination angle. Turning performance was evaluated by turning time and turning steps.\nResults: During turning, PD adults rotated the head, thorax and pelvis simultaneously, whereas healthy adults rotated in a cranial to caudal sequence. Further, PD adults had a smaller sagittal inclination angle (p<0.001) but larger frontal inclination angle (p=0.006) than healthy adults. PD adults also turned slower (p=0.002) with a greater number of steps (p<0.001) than healthy adults. Last, PD adults showed a significant correlation between the sagittal inclination angle and turning steps (Spearman's ρ=-0.63), while healthy adults showed a significant correlation between frontal inclination angle and turning steps (Spearman's ρ=-0.67).\nConclusion: This study demonstrated the axial rigidity in PD adults during turning may reduce forward progression and increase lateral instability. The reduced progression is associated with extra turning steps and the increased lateral instability may result in great fall risk."

  "abstract": "Background: Patients with chronic neck pain show also respiratory dysfunctions.\nObjective: To investigate the effects of respiratory muscle endurance training (RMET) on chronic neck pain.\nMethods: In this pilot study (single-subject design: 3 baseline measurements, 4 measurements during RMET), 15 neck patients (49.3 ± 13.7 years; 13 females) conducted 20 sessions of home-based RMET using a SpiroTiger® (normocapnic hyperpnoea). Maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), maximal inspiratory (Pimax) and expiratory (Pemax) pressure were measured before and after RMET. Neck flexor endurance, cervical and thoracic mobility, forward head posture, chest wall expansion and self-assessed neck disability [Neck Disability Index (NDI), Bournemouth questionnaire] were weekly assessed. Repeated measure ANOVA (Bonferroni correction) compared the first and last baseline and the last measurement after RMET.\nResults: RMET significantly increased MVV (p= 0.025), Pimax (p= 0.001) and Pemax (p< 0.001). During RMET, neck disability significantly decreased (NDI: p= 0.001; Bournemouth questionnaire: p= 0.002), while neck flexor endurance (p< 0.001) and chest wall expansion (p< 0.001) increased. The changes in respiratory and musculoskeletal parameters did not correlate.\nConclusions: RMET emerged from this pilot study as a feasible and effective therapy for reducing disability in patients with chronic neck pain. The underlying mechanisms, including blood gas analyses, need further investigation in a randomized controlled study."

Static balance control was assessed according to center of gravity sway velocity and total sway distance using an automatic balance calibration system. Dynamic balance control was assessed using the diagnosis mode of a body-tilt training and measurement system. [Results] Sway velocities on a hard surface with eyes open and closed and those on an unstable sponge surface with eyes closed were significantly higher in the forward head posture group than in the control group. Furthermore, on both the hard and sponge surfaces in the eyes open and closed conditions, total sway distances were significantly higher in the forward head posture group than in the control group. Results of dynamic balance control were not significantly different between groups. [Conclusion] Forward head posture has a greater effect on static balance control than on dynamic balance control."

[Subjects] Twenty-six subjects, divided into the two groups (normal and forward head posture groups), participated in this study.

Accessory respiratory muscle activity during deep breathing was measured by electromyography. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the measure variables between the normal and forward head posture group. [Results] Forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were significantly lower in the forward head posture group than in the normal group. Accessory respiratory muscle activity was also lower in the forward head posture group than in the normal group. In particular, the sternocleidomastoid and pectoralis major activity of the forward head posture group was significantly lower than that of normal group. Activities of the other muscles were generally decreased with forward head posture, but were not significantly different between the two groups. [Conclusion] These results indicate that forward head posture could reduce vital capacity, possibly because of weakness or disharmony of the accessory respiratory muscles."

  "abstract": "Study design: Case-control study.\nBackground: Previous studies have assessed forward head posture in patients with migraine using photographs. To date, no study has compared postural differences using both radiographs and photographs.\nObjective: To determine the differences in head extension posture between women with migraine and healthy women assessed with radiographic and photographic measures.\nMethods: Thirty-three women (mean ± SD age, 32 ± 11.3 years) with migraine and 33 matched controls (age, 33 ± 12.6 years) participated. Radiographs were used to measure the high cervical angle (HCA), the angle between the most inferior line from the occipital surface to the posterior portion of C1 and the posterior surface of the odontoid process of C2, and the vertical distance between C0 and C1 (C0-C1). Photographs and commercially available software were used to assess the craniovertebral angle (CVA).\nResults: None of the outcomes differed significantly between women with migraine and control participants. Outcomes for women with migraine were HCA, 66.1° (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.2°, 68.1°); CVA, 46.1° (95% CI: 45.0°, 47.1°); and C0-C1, 8.5 mm (95% CI: 7.7, 9.2). Outcomes for the control group were HCA, 67.9° (95% CI: 66.5°, 69.3°); CVA, 44.5° (95% CI: 43.2°, 45.7°); and C0-C1, 8.7 mm (95% CI: 7.9, 9.4). Relationships between the frequency (r = -0.42, P = .01, R (2) = 10%) of migraine and the HCA were found.\nConclusion: This study demonstrated that women with migraine did not exhibit forward head posture compared to women with no history of headache in either radiographic or photographic postural analysis. However, there was a weak association of the frequency of migraine attacks with a variation in the HCA as assessed by radiographs.\nLevel of evidence: Differential diagnosis/symptom prevalence, level 4."

  "date": "2015 Sep",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The cervical range of motion device (CROM) has been shown to provide reliable forward head position (FHP) measurement when the upper cervical angle (UCA) is controlled. However, measurement without UCA standardization is reflective of habitual patterns. Criterion validity has not been reported. The purposes of this study were to establish: (1) criterion validity of CROM FHP and UCA compared to Optotrak data, (2) relative reliability and minimal detectable change (MDC95) in patients with and without cervical pain, and (3) to compare UCA and FHP in patients with and without pain in habitual postures.\nMethods: (1) Within-subjects single session concurrent criterion validity design. Simultaneous CROM and OP measurement was conducted in habitual sitting posture in 16 healthy young adults. (2) Reliability and MDC95 of UCA and FHP were calculated from three trials. (3) Values for adults over 35 years with cervical pain and age-matched healthy controls were compared.\nResults: (1) Forward head position distances were moderately correlated and UCA angles were highly correlated. The mean (standard deviation) differences can be expected to vary between 1·48 cm (1·74) for FHP and -1·7 (2·46)° for UCA. (2) Reliability for CROM FHP measurements were good to excellent (no pain) and moderate (pain). Cervical range of motion FHP MDC95 was moderately low (no pain), and moderate (pain). Reliability for CROM UCA measurements was excellent and MDC95 low for both groups. There was no difference in FHP distances between the pain and no pain groups, UCA was significantly more extended in the pain group (P<0·05).\nDiscussion: Cervical range of motion FHP measurements were only moderately correlated with Optotrak data, and limits of agreement (LOA) and MDC95 were relatively large. There was also no difference in CROM FHP distance between older symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Cervical range of motion FHP measurement is therefore not recommended as a clinical outcome measure. Cervical range of motion UCA measurements showed good criterion validity, excellent test-retest reliability, and achievable MDC95 in asymptomatic and symptomatic participants. Differences of more than 6° are required to exceed error. Cervical range of motion UCA shows promise as a useful reliable and valid measurement, particularly as patients with cervical pain exhibited significantly more extended angles."

  "date": "2016 Feb 15",
  "abstract": "Background: Musculoskeletal disorders represent a significant occupational health issue in dental hygiene, with high prevalence rates documented. Despite this fact, there have been few advancements in the application of ergonomic principles in the dental hygiene profession. While the use of loupes is often promoted as an ergonomic solution, there is little published research to support this claim.\nObjectives: The aim of the present study, therefore, was to investigate the effect of the use of loupes on neck pain and disability in dental hygienists.\nMethods: The study was conducted using an exploratory pre-test post-test design, comparing musculoskeletal measures in dental hygienists wearing loupes with final year dental hygiene students who do not wear loupes. Pre- and post-test measures included the Neck Pain and Disability Scale and a standardised physical assessment using previously validated measures. Statistical analysis was conducted as a series of mixed ANOVAs with time and treatment as the independent variables.\nResults: While the analyses revealed no significant interactions between time and treatment (p < 0.05), there were general trends of improvement or deterioration for outcome measures. Improvements over time were noted in the treatment group for cervical range of motion and deep neck muscle endurance; however deteriorations were noted for forward head posture and cervical kinaesthetic sense.\nConclusions: Overall, despite no statistically significant differences being detected, this study suggests that wearing loupes appears to have both positive and negative outcomes with regards to physical well-being. As such, further studies are required to more precisely determine the effects of loupes on MSD among dental hygienists, particularly long-term. Dental hygienists with existing neck pain exploring ergonomic equipment may reflect on the findings and consider the potential benefits and risks of wearing loupes."

  "abstract": "Study design: Case report.\nBackground: Neck-tongue syndrome (NTS) is defined as neck and/or head pain accompanied by ipsilateral dysesthesia of the tongue with sudden rotation of the head. Proposed causes include compression or irritation of the C2 nerve root as it courses behind the atlantoaxial joint or hypertrophy of the inferior oblique muscle. The primary purpose of this case report was to describe the conservative physical therapy treatment of a patient with uncomplicated NTS.\nCase description: The patient was a 13-year-old girl who reported insidious onset of sharp pain in the neck, numbness/tingling of the ipsilateral tongue/face, and tinnitus with cervical rotation. Symptoms occurred several times a week for approximately 10 seconds. Examination revealed impaired function, increased forward head posture, decreased cervical range of motion, and positive neurodynamic assessment. The patient's treatment included manual therapy and exercise for postural stabilization.\nOutcomes: Following 8 visits, pain of the neck and tongue numbness had resolved. Score on the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), cervical range of motion, and posture had also improved. At the 22-month follow-up, infrequent, momentary symptoms in the neck and dysesthesia of the tongue were reported. The PSFS remained the same. Objective measures were normal.\nDiscussion: This case report describes the physical therapy management of an individual with NTS. The management strategy followed a protocol similar to that used for cervicogenic headaches, due to the involvement of the upper cervical spine with both NTS and cervicogenic headache and the lack of evidence for the treatment of NTS.

[Subjects and Methods] This cross-sectional study included 21 victims of burns, nine children (age [mean ± SD], 7.3 ± 1.1 yrs) and 12 adolescents (12,0 ± 1.4 yrs), classified as medium and large burns, being investigated on pain and postural alignment evaluated by photogrammetry. Pain intensity was assessed by face scales and postural examination included the assessment of global and thoraco-lumbo-pelvic alignment by previously designed protocols. [Results] Only two adolescents reported mild pain associated with burn injuries, whereas deviations of the projection of the gravity center; forward head posture, and scapular asymmetry were observed in both groups. In the analysis of the thoraco-lumbo-pelvic alignment, children tended to have anterior inclination trunk, increased thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis, while in adolescents, increased thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis were observed. [Conclusion] The results indicate that due to the postural alterations and asymmetries in both frontal and sagittal planes, there is an increased risk of developing scoliosis and possible future pain. Thus, physiotherapy is indicated and should be maintained until complete growth is reached."

  "date": "2016 Jul",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Patients with cervical spondylosis commonly present with neck pain, radiculopathy or myelopathy. As degenerative changes progress, multiple factors including disc height loss, thoracic kyphosis, and facetogenic changes can increase the risk of neural structure compression. This study investigated the impact of cervical deformity including forward head posture (FHP) and upper thoracic kyphosis, on the anatomy of the cervical neural foramen.\nMethods: Postural changes of 13 human cervical spine specimens (Occiput-T1, age 50.6 years; range 21-67) were assessed in response to prescribed cervical sagittal malalignments using a previously reported experimental model. Two characteristics of cervical sagittal deformities, C2-C7 sagittal vertical alignment (SVA) and sagittal angle of the T1 vertebra (T1 tilt), were varied to create various cervical malalignments. The postural changes were documented by measuring vertebral positions and orientations. The vertebral motion data were combined with specimen-specific CT-based anatomical models, which allowed assessments of foraminal areas of subaxial cervical segments as a function of increasing C2-C7 SVA and changing T1 tilt.\nResults: Increasing C2-C7 SVA from neutral posture resulted in increased neural foraminal area in the lower cervical spine (largest increase at C4-C5: 13.8 ± 15.7 %, P < 0.01). Increasing SVA from a hyperkyphotic posture (greater T1 tilt) also increased the neural foraminal area in the lower cervical segments (C5-C6 demonstrated the largest increase: 13.4 ± 9.6 %, P < 0.01). The area of the cervical neural foramen decreased with increasing T1 tilt, with greater reduction occurring in the lower cervical spine, specifically at C5-C6 (-8.6 ± 7.0 %, P < 0.01) and C6-C7 (-9.6 ± 5.6 %, P < 0.01).\nConclusion: An increase in thoracic kyphosis (T1 tilt) decreased cervical neural foraminal areas. In contrast, an increase in cervical SVA increased the lower cervical neural foraminal areas. Patients with increased upper thoracic kyphosis may respond with increased cervical SVA as a compensatory mechanism to increase their lower cervical neural foraminal area."

  "title": "Comparison of Upper Extremity Physical Characteristics Between Adolescent Competitive Swimmers and Nonoverhead Athletes",
  "date": "2016 Jan",
  "abstract": "Context: Alterations to upper extremity physical characteristics of competitive swimmers (posture, range of motion [ROM], and subacromial-space distance) are commonly attributed to cumulative training load during a swimmer's competitive career. However, this accepted clinical belief has not been established in the literature. It is important to understand whether alterations in posture and associated physical characteristics occur as a result of sport training or factors other than swimming participation to better understand injury risk and possible interventions.\nObjective: To compare posture, subacromial-space distance, and glenohumeral external-rotation, internal-rotation, and horizontal-adduction ROM between adolescent competitive swimmers and nonoverhead athletes.\nDesign: Cross-sectional study.\nSetting: Local swimming pools and high school athletic training rooms.\nPatients or other participants: Forty-four competitive adolescent swimmers and 31 nonoverhead athletes who were not currently experiencing any elbow, shoulder, neck, or back pain that limited their sport activity.\nIntervention(s): Posture, subacromial-space distance, and glenohumeral ROM were measured using photography, diagnostic ultrasound, and a digital inclinometer, respectively.\nMain outcome measure(s): Forward shoulder posture, forward head posture, normalized subacromial-space distance, internal-rotation ROM, and external-rotation ROM.\nResults: No clinically significant differences existed between swimmers and nonoverhead athletes for posture, normalized subacromial-space distance, or external- or internal-rotation ROM. Swimmers presented with less horizontal-adduction ROM than nonoverhead athletes.\nConclusions: Factors other than swimming participation, such as school and technology use, play important roles in the adaptation of physical characteristics in adolescents. Adolescents, regardless of swimming participation, presented with postural deviations. It is important to consider factors other than swimming participation that contribute to alterations in physical characteristics to understand injury risk and injury-prevention strategies in competitive adolescent swimmers."

  "title": "The Effect of Head Position and/or Stance on the Self-perception of Phonatory Effort",
  "date": "2017 Jan",
  "abstract": "Background: Vocal fatigue is a common but poorly defined complaint of patients presenting with voice disorders. Definitions of vocal fatigue generally include increased self-perceived phonatory effort resulting from references to vocal loading or prolonged voice use resulting in deterioration of function. The present study looks at the role of posture, specifically head position and stance, in self-perceived phonatory effort.\nMethods: Forty-six healthy adults, 13 males and 33 females (mean age was 27.5), with no history of vocal problems/disorders within the past year were recruited. Subjects were asked to sustain the vowel /a/ at a comfortable pitch and loudness for 5-10 seconds in each of six positions: sitting and standing in the manner habitual for each subject, two exaggerated positions of the head (head back and head forward), and two exaggerated positions in standing (standing with knees locked and with knees soft). Each position was repeated three times in randomized order, resulting in 18 trials for each subject. After each repetition of the sustained /a/, subjects were asked to rate their experience of vocal effort using a 100-mm visual analog scale (0-40 least effort, 40-60 habitual effort, and 60-100 increased effort).\nResults: Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant difference in the self-perceived phonatory effort levels across positions (P value < 0.001). The exaggerated forward and back head positions in both sitting and standing positions showed the greatest significance on the Tukey post hoc tests (P < 0.000).\nConclusions: Based on the findings, posture may play a more important role in vocal fatigue than previously thought."

  "title": "Evaluation of validity and reliability of a methodology for measuring human postural attitude and its relation to temporomandibular joint disorders",
  "date": "2016 Apr",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs) are caused by several factors such as anatomical, neuromuscular and psychological alterations. A relationship has been established between TMJDs and postural alterations, a type of anatomical alteration. An anterior position of the head requires hyperactivity of the posterior neck region and shoulder muscles to prevent the head from falling forward. This compensatory muscular function may cause fatigue, discomfort and trigger point activation. To our knowledge, a method for assessing human postural attitude in more than one plane has not been reported. Thus, the aim of this study was to design a methodology to measure the external human postural attitude in frontal and sagittal planes, with proper validity and reliability analyses.\nMethods: The variable postures of 78 subjects (36 men, 42 women; age 18-24 years) were evaluated. The postural attitudes of the subjects were measured in the frontal and sagittal planes, using an acromiopelvimeter, grid panel and Fox plane.\nResults: The method we designed for measuring postural attitudes had adequate reliability and validity, both qualitatively and quantitatively, based on Cohen's Kappa coefficient (> 0.87) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r = 0.824, > 80%).\nConclusion: This method exhibits adequate metrical properties and can therefore be used in further research on the association of human body posture with skeletal types and TMJDs."

  "date": "2016",
  "abstract": "Using stabilometry study the center of pressure (COP) displacement over the horizontal surface and power spectrum characteristics of postural sway in the sagittal and frontal planes (Y and X- oscillations, respectively) during an upright stance (US) and under the conditions of body bents forward and backward (BF and BB, respectively) were investigated in a group of 15 volunteers. The tests were performed under the conditions of opened and closed eyes. It was demonstrated that the power spectrum of sway depended on posture, it was greater under the conditions of body bents than during the upright stance. In all three positions blocking of optical input resulted in an increase in power spectrum as well of Y- and X-oscillations in a number of frequency bands of body sway. A significant dependence on the visual control for the mean value of COP under the conditions of bents backward was also found. Data on changes in the lateral oscillations under the conditions of body bents in the sagittal plane showed the essential role of ankle proprioceptors in the genesis of the lateral oscillations at keeping balance during standing. The comparative analysis of power spectrum characteristics of postural sway in the sagittal and frontal planes under the conditions of opened and closed eyes indicated a significant interaction between proprioceptive and visual afferentation at positions of body bents relative to upright stance."

  "date": "2016 Feb 23",
  "abstract": "The ability to acquire large-scale recordings of neuronal activity in awake and unrestrained animals is needed to provide new insights into how populations of neurons generate animal behavior. We present an instrument capable of recording intracellular calcium transients from the majority of neurons in the head of a freely behaving Caenorhabditis elegans with cellular resolution while simultaneously recording the animal's position, posture, and locomotion. This instrument provides whole-brain imaging with cellular resolution in an unrestrained and behaving animal. We use spinning-disk confocal microscopy to capture 3D volumetric fluorescent images of neurons expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6s at 6 head-volumes/s. A suite of three cameras monitor neuronal fluorescence and the animal's position and orientation. Custom software tracks the 3D position of the animal's head in real time and two feedback loops adjust a motorized stage and objective to keep the animal's head within the field of view as the animal roams freely. We observe calcium transients from up to 77 neurons for over 4 min and correlate this activity with the animal's behavior. We characterize noise in the system due to animal motion and show that, across worms, multiple neurons show significant correlations with modes of behavior corresponding to forward, backward, and turning locomotion."

  "date": "2015 Nov",
  "abstract": "[Purpose] The present study investigated differences in the kinematics of the neck and activation of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle during neck rotation between subjects with and without forward head posture (FHP). [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-eight subjects participated in the study (14 with FHP, 14 without FHP). Subjects performed neck rotation in two directions, left and right. The kinematics of rotation-lateral flexion movement patterns were recorded using motion analysis. Activity in the bilateral SCM muscles was measured using surface electromyography. Differences in neck kinematics and activation of SCM between the groups were analyzed by independent t-tests. [Results] Maintaining FHP increased the rotation-lateral flexion ratio significantly in both directions. The FHP group had significantly faster onset time for lateral flexion movement in both directions during neck rotation. Regarding the electromyography of the SCM muscles during neck rotation in both directions, the activity values of subjects with FHP were greater than those of subjects without FHP for the contralateral SCM muscles. [Conclusion] FHP can induce changes in movement in the frontal plane and SCM muscle activation during neck rotation. Thus, clinicians should consider movement in the frontal plane as well as in the sagittal plane when assessing and treating patients with forward head posture."

  "date": "2016 Jan",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of table and seat slope on the biomechanical stress sustained by the musculo-skeletal system. Angular position of the head and trunk, and surface electromyography of eleven postural muscles were recorded while seated under different conditions of seat slope (0°, 15° forward) and table slope (0°, 20° backward). The specific stress sustained by C7-T1 joint was estimated with isometric torque calculation. The results showed that the backward sloping table was associated with a reduction of neck flexion and neck extensors EMG, contrasting with a concurrent overactivity of the deltoideus. The forward sloping chair induced an anterior pelvic tilt, but also a higher activity of the knee (vasti) and ankle (soleus) extensors. It was concluded that sloping chairs and tables favor a more erect posture of the spine, but entails an undesirable overactivity of upper and lower limbs muscles to prevent the body from sliding."

  "date": "2015 Nov",
  "abstract": "The objective of this study is to develop a method that uses a combination of field data analysis, naturalistic driving data analysis, and computational simulations to explore the potential injury reduction capabilities of integrating passive and active safety systems in frontal impact conditions. For the purposes of this study, the active safety system is actually a driver assist (DA) feature that has the potential to reduce delta-V prior to a crash, in frontal or other crash scenarios. A field data analysis was first conducted to estimate the delta-V distribution change based on an assumption of 20% crash avoidance resulting from a pre-crash braking DA feature. Analysis of changes in driver head location during 470 hard braking events in a naturalistic driving study found that drivers' head positions were mostly in the center position before the braking onset, while the percentage of time drivers leaning forward or backward increased significantly after the braking onset. Parametric studies with a total of 4800 MADYMO simulations showed that both delta-V and occupant pre-crash posture had pronounced effects on occupant injury risks and on the optimal restraint designs. By combining the results for the delta-V and head position distribution changes, a weighted average of injury risk reduction of 17% and 48% was predicted by the 50th percentile Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) model and human body model, respectively, with the assumption that the restraint system can adapt to the specific delta-V and pre-crash posture. This study demonstrated the potential for further reducing occupant injury risk in frontal crashes by the integration of a passive safety system with a DA feature. Future analyses considering more vehicle models, various crash conditions, and variations of occupant characteristics, such as age, gender, weight, and height, are necessary to further investigate the potential capability of integrating passive and DA or active safety systems."

It also examined the effectiveness of deep cervical flexor training with a pressure biofeedback unit. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty college students were recruited and randomly assigned to groups that underwent either deep cervical flexor training with a pressure biofeedback unit (experimental group, n=10) or conventional deep cervical flexor training (control group, n=10). The craniovertebral angle of each subject was measured with a lateral-view picture. Neck mobility was assessed using a cervical range of motion device and muscular endurance was measured using a pressure biofeedback unit. Both groups performed conventional deep cervical flexor exercises three times a week for six weeks. The experimental group underwent a pressure biofeedback unit training was 5 to10 minutes/day, thrice a week. [Results] Cervical range of motion in the experimental group increased significantly between the end of training and the end of the four week detraining period, compared to that in control group. [Conclusion] Deep cervical flexor training with a pressure biofeedback unit is a useful method for maintaining neck mobility and muscular endurance in people with forward head posture."

The secondary aims were to explore potential associations between muscles endurance, head posture and neck pain characteristics and to assess intra-rater reliability of the measurements used.\nMethods: Adolescents with neck pain (n = 35) and age-matched asymptomatic adolescents (n = 35) had their forward head posture, neck flexor endurance and neck extensor endurance measured using clinical tests. Intra-rater reliability was also assessed.\nResults: Forward head posture and neck flexor and extensor endurance tests showed moderate to almost perfect intra-rater reliability (ICC between 0.58 and 0.88). Adolescents with neck pain showed significantly less forward head posture (neck pain = 46.62 ± 4.92; asymptomatic = 44.18°± 3.64°, p > 0.05) and less neck flexor (neck pain = 24.50 ± 23.03s; asymptomatic = 35.89 ± 21.53s, p > 0.05) and extensor endurance (neck pain = 12.6.64 ± 77.94s; asymptomatic = 168.66 ± 74.77s, p > 0.05) than asymptomatic adolescents.\nConclusions: Results suggest that changes in posture and neck muscle endurance are a feature of adolescents with neck pain."

  "date": "2015 Oct",
  "abstract": "The Upper Crossed Syndrome (UCS) was presented by Janda to introduce neuromotor aspects of upper body muscle imbalances, describing sagittal plane postural asymmetries as barriers to recovery from chronic locomotor system pain syndromes. The UCS describes muscle imbalances of key antagonists causing forward postures of the head and shoulders and associated changes in the spinal curves -particularly an increased thoracic kyphosis - as well as changed function in the shoulder girdle. The role of fascial tissue has gained remarkable interest over the past decade, previously emphasizing its anatomic compartmental and binding role, while more recently emphasizing load transfer, sensory and kinetic chain function. The authors introduce the Mid-Pectoral Fascial Lesion (MPFL) as a myofascial disorder, describing 11 ipsilateral chest wall cases. While managing these cases, the authors encountered and subsequently designated the Torsional Upper Crossed Syndrome (TUCS) as a multi-planar addition to Janda's classic sagittal plane model. This article integrates published updates regarding the role of posture and fascia with the effects of chest wall trauma and a newly described associated postural syndrome as illustrated with this case series. An effective therapeutic approach to release the MPFL is then briefly described."

We used the head repositioning accuracy (HRA) test to evaluate neck position senses of neck flexion, neck extension, neck right and left side flexion, and neck right and left rotation and calculated the root mean square error in trials for each subject. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and regression analysis were used to assess the degree of correlation between the trunk posture and HRA value, and a significance level of α = 0.05 was considered.\nResults: There were significant correlations between the HRA value of right side neck flexion and pelvic side tilt angle (p < 0.05). If pelvic side tilting angle increases by 1 degree, right side neck flexion increased by 0.76 degrees (p = 0.026). However, there were no significant correlations between other neck motions and trunk postures.\nConclusion: Verifying pelvic postures should be prioritized when movement is limited due to the vitiation of the proprioceptive sense of neck caused by FHP."

  "abstract": "Disabled elderly individuals with kyphosis or loss of muscle strength often display forward head posture (FHP). This study aimed to determine the utility of a wheelchair incorporating pelvic support in preventing FHP in disabled elderly individuals. In this study, 14 disabled elderly individuals (87.1 ± 8.1 years) were selected. A wheelchair incorporating pelvic support (RX_ABS Lo) and a basic wheelchair (RX-1) were used. Each individual sat on both wheelchairs for 30 minutes. RX_ABS Lo has two belts to support the pelvic and thorax. Postures were recorded in the sagittal plane using a video camera. Cervical and trunk angles from horizontal were measured every 5 minutes. Simultaneously, contact areas and total pressures applied to the wheelchair seats and back supports were measured every 5 minutes. Comparisons of area under the curve values between the wheelchairs were performed using the paired t-test. Comparisons of time-dependent parameters for each wheelchair were performed using repeated one-way ANOVA. Cervical angles were greater when using RX_ABS Lo than RX-1. Although cervical angles were unchanged during 30 minutes when using RX_ABS Lo, the angles were significantly decreased after 30 minutes of using RX-1. Back support pressures and contact areas were greater for RX_ABS Lo than for RX-1. No significant difference in back support pressure distributions was observed during 30 minutes in the wheelchairs. The RX_ABS Lo may have utility in improving FHP by increasing cervical angles and improving stability with a back support to the upper thorax, lower thorax, and pelvis during prolonged sitting."

  "date": "2015 Nov 18",
  "abstract": "Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a multifactorial disorder including neurological factors. A dysfunction of the sensorimotor networks processing vestibular information could be related to spine deformation. This study investigates whether feed-forward vestibulomotor control or sensory reweighting mechanisms are impaired in adolescent scoliosis patients. Vestibular evoked postural responses were obtained using galvanic vestibular stimulation while participants stood with their eyes closed and head facing forward. Lateral forces under each foot and lateral displacement of the upper body of adolescents with mild (n = 20) or severe (n = 16) spine deformation were compared to those of healthy control adolescents (n = 16). Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients demonstrated greater lateral displacement and net lateral forces than controls both during and immediately after vestibular stimulation. Altered sensory reweighting of vestibular and proprioceptive information changed balance control of AIS patients during and after vestibular stimulation. Therefore, scoliosis onset could be related to abnormal sensory reweighting, leading to altered sensorimotor processes."

Data concerning the reproducibility of its assessment are not available. This study aimed to evaluate the intra-observer and inter-observer reproducibility of the assessment of the manoeuvre and to assess whether the amount of clinical experience affects its reproducibility.\nMethods: Two lateral photographs, one in centric occlusion, and the other with the mandible postured forward (Fränkel manoeuvre) of 100 Angle Class II individuals aged between 9 and 13 years were evaluated by six orthodontists (T0). Each examiner was asked whether the facial profile worsen or not with the manoeuvre after being trained by an expert orthodontist. The test was repeated after 2 weeks interval (T1). Intra-observer and inter-observer agreement were evaluated by computing the Cohen's K.\nResults: The agreement (K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.49 to 0.72. The overall agreement was 0.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.75]. The agreement in the group with less clinical experience was 0.61 (95% CI = 0.46-0.76), while it was 0.68 (95% CI = 0.53-0.83) in the more experienced group. The amount of clinical experience did not affect intra-observer agreement (P = 0.50). The overall agreement between the examiners and the trainer was 0.74 (95% CI = 0.65-0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI = 0.64-0.83) at T0 and T1 respectively.\nConclusion: The assessment of the Fränkel manoeuvre is reproducible and it is not influenced by the amount of clinical experience."

  "abstract": "Purpose: The head represents 6% of total body weight, therefore it can significantly affect the biomechanics of human posture control, movements and activities. When set out of vertical body axis, head position interferes with the work of the other links in the kinematic chain. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of head posture on the breathing activities of the chest.\nMaterial and methods: The research was conducted on a group of 65 patients (51 years ± 9.8 years), including 48 women and 17 men. Head posture and chest movements were assessed using a photogrammetric method.\nResults: The results confirmed the existence of a negative correlation between head position in the sagittal plane and movements of lower ribs. Forward head posture resulted in lower amplitude of costal arch motion: for the transverse plane Spearman's R = -0.296, for the frontal plane; -0.273, -0.289. Tilting the head in the frontal plane also influenced the change in the biomechanics of breathing and contributed to a reduction of respiratory movements of the lower ribs Spearman's R = -0.260.\nConclusions: Changing the position of the head causes disturbances in the three-dimensional shape of the chest and its respiratory movements."

  "abstract": "Introduction: Working donkeys in Maun, Botswana contribute to people's livelihoods substantially through the provision of transport, ploughing and income generating activities. However, working donkeys suffer from various welfare issues that were investigated in this study to provide preliminary insights on their health and well-being.\nMaterials and methods: An assessment protocol involving direct observations of the donkeys was developed and operationalised to assess physical and emotional welfare. Physical welfare parameters such as body condition score, abnormal limbs, impeded gait, eye abnormalities, sore and scar locations, hoof and coat condition were recorded. Emotional welfare parameters such as eyes, tail movement, ear position, neck position, posture and vocalisation were recorded. In addition, donkey-owner interactions were recorded and scored, as well as the donkey's response to environmental factors. A total cross-section of 100 donkeys sub-stratified by roles of riding, cart pulling and resting were randomly selected in eight villages and three urban wards and assessed during the period of May to August 2012.\nResults: The findings reveals that the 100 adult working donkeys assessed were physically afflicted by poor BCSs of two (66 per cent), long and cracked hooves (50 per cent), sores on at least two locations on their body (53 per cent), scars on at least two locations on their body (86 per cent), and poor coat conditions (58 per cent). Emotionally, donkeys displayed unresponsiveness (35 per cent), avoidance (31 per cent), disinterest in hand sniffing (59 per cent), dull facial expression (33 per cent), tail stillness (89 per cent), neck stiffness and/or raised head (13 per cent) or head hanging low (32 per cent visibly withdrawn), and tense ears pointing back or to the side (69 per cent). By contrast, the remaining donkeys (31 per cent) exhibited a happy demeanour of curiosity, interest, alert facial expression, tail swishing, relaxed ears pointed to the side or forward and neck relaxed and/or level.\nConclusions: This study offers preliminary findings from an investigation into the welfare of working donkeys in Greater Maun, Botswana, and provides baseline research to inform future research and strategies to enhance donkey well-being."

  "title": "Backrest Shape Affects Head-Neck Alignment and Seated Pressure",
  "date": "2015",
  "abstract": "Unstable back support against gravity results in a forward head posture and contributes to buttocks pressure ulcers. However, the association between these health problems and a wheelchair backrest is unclear. Our newly developed wheelchair (N-WC) supports the back of the pelvis and thorax from obliquely underneath. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different backrest shapes on head-neck alignment and seated pressure. Data from 28 healthy subjects were analyzed. Outcome measures were head-neck alignment angles, support angles of the backrest, and pressure distributions on the supporting surfaces. Compared with a typical wheelchair that has a flat backrest, the seat pressure decreased and the center of pressure was located in the middle of both the seat and backrest in the N-WC. Moreover, the head-neck alignment when seated in the N-WC was upright. These results highlight the importance of the shape of the wheelchair backrest."

  "date": "2015 Dec",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Microvascular perfusion may be a non-invasive indicator of fluid responsiveness. We aimed to investigate which of the microvascular perfusion parameters truly reflects fluid responsiveness independent of sympathetic reflexes.\nMethods: Fifteen healthy volunteers underwent a postural change from head up tilt (HUT) to the supine position, diminishing sympathetic tone, followed by a 30° passive leg raising (PLR) with unaltered tone. Prior to and after the postural changes, stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were measured, as well as sublingual microcirculatory perfusion (sidestream dark field imaging), skin perfusion, and oxygenation (laser Doppler flowmetry and reflectance spectroscopy).\nResults: In responders (subjects with >10 % increase in CO), the HUT to supine change increased CO, SV, and pulse pressure, while heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, and mean arterial pressure decreased. Additionally, microvascular flow index, laser Doppler flow, and microvascular hemoglobin oxygen saturation and concentration also increased.\nConclusion: When preload and forward flow increase in association with a decrease in sympathetic activity, microvascular blood flow increases in the skin and in the sublingual area. When preload and forward flow increase with little to no change in sympathetic activity, only sublingual functional capillary density increases. Therefore, our results indicate that sublingual functional capillary density is the best parameter to use when evaluating fluid responsiveness independent of changes in sympathetic tone."

  "date": "2015 Dec",
  "abstract": "Purpose: With the dramatic growth of mobile phone usage, concerns have been raised with regard to the adverse health effects of mobile phone on spinal posture. The aim of this study was to determine the head and cervical postures by photogrammetry when viewing the mobile phone screen, compared with those in neutral standing posture.\nMethods: A total of 186 subjects (81 females and 105 males) aged from 17 to 31 years old participated in this study. Subjects were instructed to stand neutrally and using mobile phone as in daily life. Using a photographic method, the sagittal head and cervical postures were assessed by head tilt angle, neck tilt angle, forward head shift and gaze angle.\nResults: The photographic method showed a high intra-rater and inter-rater reliability in measuring the sagittal posture of cervical spine and gaze angle (ICCs ranged from 0.80 to 0.99). When looking at mobile phone, the head tilt angle significantly increased (from 74.55° to 95.22°, p = 0.000) and the neck angle decreased (from 54.68° to 38.77°, p = 0.000). The forward head posture was also confirmed by the significantly increased head shift (from 10.90 to 13.85 cm, p = 0.000). The posture assumed in mobile phone use was significantly correlated with neutral posture (p < 0.05). Males displayed a more forward head posture than females (p < 0.05). The head tilt angle was positively correlated with the gaze angle (r = 0.616, p = 0.000), while the neck tilt angle was negatively correlated with the gaze angle (r = -0.628, p = 0.000).\nConclusions: Photogrammetry is a reliable, quantitative method to evaluate the head and cervical posture during mobile phone use. Compared to neutral standing, subjects display a more forward head posture when viewing the mobile phone screen, which is correlated with neutral posture, gaze angle and gender. Future studies will be needed to investigate a dose-response relationship between mobile phone use and assumed posture."

  "title": "The study of correlation between forward head posture and neck pain in Iranian office workers",
  "date": "2015",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Factors such as prolonged sitting at work or improper posture of head during work may have a great role in neck pain occurrence among office employees, particularly among those who work with computers. Although some studies claim a significant difference in head posture between patients and pain-free participants, in literature the forward head posture (FHP) has not always been associated with neck pain. Since head, cervical and thoracic postures and their relation with neck pain has not been studied in Iranian office employees, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between some work-related and individual factors, such as poor posture, with neck pain in the office employees.\nMaterial and methods: It was a cross-sectional correlation study carried out to explore the relationship between neck pain and sagittal postures of cervical and thoracic spine among office employees in forward looking position and also in a working position. Forty-six subjects without neck pain and 55 with neck pain were examined using a photographic method. Thoracic and cervical postures were measured using the high thoracic (HT) and craniovertebral (CV) angles, respectively.\nResults: High thoracic and CV angles were positively correlated with the presence of neck pain only in working position (p < 0.05). In forward looking position, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (p > 0.05).\nConclusions: Our findings have revealed that office employees had a defective posture while working and that the improper posture was more severe in the office employees who suffered from the neck pain."

  "title": "Zebrafish Models for the Mechanosensory Hair Cell Dysfunction in Usher Syndrome 3 Reveal That Clarin-1 Is an Essential Hair Bundle Protein",
  "date": "2015 Jul 15",
  "abstract": "Usher syndrome type III (USH3) is characterized by progressive loss of hearing and vision, and varying degrees of vestibular dysfunction. It is caused by mutations that affect the human clarin-1 protein (hCLRN1), a member of the tetraspanin protein family. The missense mutation CLRN1(N48K), which affects a conserved N-glycosylation site in hCLRN1, is a common causative USH3 mutation among Ashkenazi Jews. The affected individuals hear at birth but lose that function over time. Here, we developed an animal model system using zebrafish transgenesis and gene targeting to provide an explanation for this phenotype. Immunolabeling demonstrated that Clrn1 localized to the hair cell bundles (hair bundles). The clrn1 mutants generated by zinc finger nucleases displayed aberrant hair bundle morphology with diminished function. Two transgenic zebrafish that express either hCLRN1 or hCLRN1(N48K) in hair cells were produced to examine the subcellular localization patterns of wild-type and mutant human proteins. hCLRN1 localized to the hair bundles similarly to zebrafish Clrn1; in contrast, hCLRN1(N48K) largely mislocalized to the cell body with a small amount reaching the hair bundle. We propose that this small amount of hCLRN1(N48K) in the hair bundle provides clarin-1-mediated function during the early stages of life; however, the presence of hCLRN1(N48K) in the hair bundle diminishes over time because of intracellular degradation of the mutant protein, leading to progressive loss of hair bundle integrity and hair cell function. These findings and genetic tools provide an understanding and path forward to identify therapies to mitigate hearing loss linked to the CLRN1 mutation.\nSignificance statement: Mutations in the clarin-1 gene affect eye and ear function in humans. Individuals with the CLRN1(N48K) mutation are born able to hear but lose that function over time. Here, we develop an animal model system using zebrafish transgenesis and gene targeting to provide an explanation for this phenotype. This approach illuminates the role of clarin-1 and the molecular mechanism linked to the CLRN1(N48K) mutation in sensory hair cells of the inner ear. Additionally, the investigation provided an in vivo model to guide future drug discovery to rescue the hCLRN1(N48K) in hair cells."

  "title": "Biomechanical analysis of biphasic distribution of skull injury in falls from height",
  "date": "2015 Oct",
  "abstract": "Fall from height is one of the most common ways of suicide in Korea. Skull fractures are typically accompanied with these cases, but several autopsy cases show absence of skull fracture even with serious body injuries including sternal and vertebral fracture. The mechanism of this pattern of injury can be explained by impact of facial part on chest or abdomen when the back of the body touches the ground first. We tried to figure out the relevance of this pattern of injury to the height of fall using a computer simulation tool (MADYMO 7.5). For this experiment, a condition of initial pose was limited to leaning forward. The simulation showed that when the body rotated forward, the body parts which got injured by the ground depended on the height of fall. For relatively lower height, head got injured, but as the height was set higher, the point of first impact area changed to the back, hip and then legs. When the body struck first around hip area on supine position, the impact made forceful flexion of lumbar, thoracic and cervical vertebrae, leading to folding the body in two, which resulted in collision between the part of face and the anterior part of body. Through the current investigation, it was explained that the biphasic distribution of the number of head injury cases versus the height distribution was attributed to the forward rotation of the body during the fall."

  "date": "2015 Aug 15",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Anterocollis as a rare subtype of cervical dystonia is difficult to treat and thus less appreciated than other subtypes of cervical dystonia. This review aimed at summarising and discussing recent advances in the management of anterocollis.\nMethods: Literature review.\nResults: Pure anterocollis is a rare condition but 1-24% of the cases of complex cervical dystonia present with an anterocollis component. Applying the collum-caput concept, anterocollis may be subdivided into conceptual anterocollis, anterocaput, and forward sagittal shift, which is useful to direct selection of dystonic muscles for treatment. Additionally, identification of dystonic muscles in conceptual anterocollis, anterocaput, or forward sagittal shift is achieved by electromyography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or FDG-positron emission tomography. Treatment of choice is botulinum toxin A. In case of treatment failure, more rarely affected muscles need to be identified and injected. Deep muscles, as are frequently involved in conceptual anterocollis, anterocaput, and forward sagittal shift, should be injected only under guidance of electromyography, endoscopy, or imaging. The more accurately affected muscles are identified, the better the outcome.\nConclusions: Anterocollis as a subtype of cervical dystonia, responds poorly to botulinum toxin but management of this condition can be improved by application of identifying and guiding technologies."

  "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the respiratory and postural adaptations associated with mouth and nasal breathing and to evaluate the associations of such adaptations in mouth breathers' self-perceived quality of life.\nMethod: Cross-sectional study with mouth breathers (initial n=116 and final n=48) and nasal breathers (initial n=131 and final n=24) from elementary school, aged between 7 and 14 years. Chest expansion, using cirtometry, the breathing pattern and the use of accessory muscles, by means of clinical evaluations and photogrammetry, and flexibility tests were evaluated in both groups. Subsequently, the mouth breathers were asked to complete the quality of life questionnaire. Statistical tests: Chi-square, odds ratio, Mann-Whitney, and binomial tests were first applied followed by logistic regressions.\nResults: Thoracic breathing (p=0.04), using of accessory muscles (p=0.03) and reductions in flexibility (p=0.001) increased the chances of an individual being a mouth breather when compared to nasal breathers. Subsequently, using of accessory muscles decreased the chances of snoring among mouth breathers (p=0.03); the presence of shoulder asymmetry reduced the chances of experiencing quiet sleep (p=0.05) and increased the chances of coughing or being tired when playing or running (p=0.008). Finally, forward head position reduced the chances of waking up at night (p=0.04) and experiencing shortness of breath (p=0.05).\nConclusions: Respiratory and postural adaptations increased the chances of individuals persisting with mouth breathing. Additionally, these adaptations could be associated with mouth breathers' self-perceived quality of life."

  "title": "Distinct lower visual field preference for object shape",
  "date": "2015",
  "abstract": "Humans manipulate objects chiefly within their lower visual field, a consequence of upright posture and the anatomical position of hands and arms.This study tested the hypothesis of enhanced sensitivity to a range of stimuli within the lower visual field. Following current models of hierarchical processing within the ventral steam, discrimination sensitivity was measured for orientation, curvature, shape (radial frequency patterns), and faces at various para-central locations (horizontal, vertical, and main diagonal meridians) and eccentricities (5° and 10°). Peripheral sensitivity was isotropic for orientation and curvature. By contrast, observers were significantly better at discriminating shapes throughout the lower visual field compared to elsewhere. For faces, however, peak sensitivity was found in the left visual field, corresponding to the right hemispheric localization of human face processing. Presenting head outlines without any internal features (e.g., eyes, mouth) recovered the lower visual field advantage found for simple shapes. A lower visual field preference for the shape of an object, which is absent for more localized information (orientation and curvature) but also for more complex objects (faces), is inconsistent with a strictly feed-forward model and poses a challenge for multistage models of object perception. The distinct lower visual field preference for contour shapes is, however, consistent with an asymmetry at intermediate stages of visual processing, which may play a key role in representing object characteristics that are particularly relevant to visually guided actions."

  "date": "2016",
  "abstract": "OpenSim offers a valuable approach to investigating otherwise difficult to assess yet important biomechanical parameters such as joint reaction forces. Although the range of available models in the public repository is continually increasing, there currently exists no OpenSim model for the computation of intervertebral joint reactions during flexion and lifting tasks. The current work combines and improves elements of existing models to develop an enhanced model of the upper body and lumbar spine. Models of the upper body with extremities, neck and head were combined with an improved version of a lumbar spine from the model repository. Translational motion was enabled for each lumbar vertebrae with six controllable degrees of freedom. Motion segment stiffness was implemented at lumbar levels and mass properties were assigned throughout the model. Moreover, body coordinate frames of the spine were modified to allow straightforward variation of sagittal alignment and to simplify interpretation of results. Evaluation of model predictions for level L1-L2, L3-L4 and L4-L5 in various postures of forward flexion and moderate lifting (8 kg) revealed an agreement within 10% to experimental studies and model-based computational analyses. However, in an extended posture or during lifting of heavier loads (20 kg), computed joint reactions differed substantially from reported in vivo measures using instrumented implants. We conclude that agreement between the model and available experimental data was good in view of limitations of both the model and the validation datasets. The presented model is useful in that it permits computation of realistic lumbar spine joint reaction forces during flexion and moderate lifting tasks. The model and corresponding documentation are now available in the online OpenSim repository."

A 16 week detraining period followed the 32-week.\nResults: Significant increase were observed in the cervical and shoulder angle in the experimental group following the 32 week-intervention period. After the 16-week detraining period no significant differences were observed in the three postural angles in the intervention group.\nConclusions: The exercise intervention was successful at decreasing forward head and protracted shoulder in adolescents. Detraining period was not sufficient to reduce the overall training effects.

The number of patients having neck pain is increasing as usage of digital devices becomes more frequent. If patients could be notified how inappropriate their postures are in real time, the number of patients could be lower. Unfortunately, there is no digitized standard way of diagnosis for forward head posture. This study applies a concept based on a vector related to two angles which are acquired from the neck and the head, so that a device can diagnose the posture by measuring and analysing the angles. To obtain the vector, integral calculations of displacement of the head are needed. As a result, with this device, patients' faulty posture can be easily detected."

In this nonrandomized, cross-sectional study, the diagnoses of TMD were made with the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC)/TMD axis I. The craniovertebral angle was used to evaluate forward head posture in the sagittal plane, and the interpupillary line was used to measure head tilt in the frontal plane. The measurements to evaluate head posture were made using the Software for the Assessment of Posture (SAPO). Students were divided into two study groups, based on the presence or absence of TMD. The study group comprised 46 students and the control group comprised 80 students. Data about head posture and TMD were analyzed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 13. Most cases of TMD were classified as degenerative processes (group III), followed by disk displacement (group II) and muscle disorders (group I). There was no sex predominance for the type of disorder. No association was found between prevalence rates for head postures in the frontal plane and the occurrence of TMD. The same result was found for the association of TMD diagnosis with craniovertebral angle among men and women, and the group that contained both men and women. Abnormal head postures were common among individuals both with and without TMD. No association was found between head posture evaluated in the frontal and sagittal planes and TMD diagnosis with the use of RDC/TMD."

  "date": "2015 Aug",
  "abstract": "We investigated how head position and gait speed influenced frontal plane balance responses to external perturbations during gait. Thirteen healthy participants walked on a treadmill at three different gait speeds. Visual conditions included either focus downward on lower extremities and walking surface only or focus forward on a stationary scene with horizontal and vertical lines. The treadmill was positioned on a platform that was stationary (non-perturbed) or moving in a pattern that appeared random to the subjects (perturbed). In non-perturbed walking, medial-lateral upper body motion was very similar between visual conditions. However, in perturbed walking, there was significantly less body motion when focus was on the stationary visual scene, suggesting visual feedback of stationary vertical and horizontal cues are particularly important when balance is challenged. Sensitivity of body motion to perturbations was significantly decreased by increasing gait speed, suggesting that faster walking was less sensitive to frontal plane perturbations. Finally, our use of external perturbations supported the idea that certain differences in balance control mechanisms can only be detected in more challenging situations, which is an important consideration for approaches to investigating sensory contribution to balance during gait."

  "date": "2015 Apr 20",
  "abstract": "To determine how the vestibular sense controls balance, we used instantaneous head angular velocity to drive a galvanic vestibular stimulus so that afference would signal that head movement was faster or slower than actual. In effect, this changed vestibular afferent gain. This increased sway 4-fold when subjects (N = 8) stood without vision. However, after a 240 s conditioning period with stable balance achieved through reliable visual or somatosensory cues, sway returned to normal. An equivalent galvanic stimulus unrelated to sway (not driven by head motion) was equally destabilising but in this situation the conditioning period of stable balance did not reduce sway. Reflex muscle responses evoked by an independent, higher bandwidth vestibular stimulus were initially reduced in amplitude by the galvanic stimulus but returned to normal levels after the conditioning period, contrary to predictions that they would decrease after adaptation to increased sensory gain and increase after adaptation to decreased sensory gain. We conclude that an erroneous vestibular signal of head motion during standing has profound effects on balance control. If it is unrelated to current head motion, the CNS has no immediate mechanism of ignoring the vestibular signal to reduce its influence on destabilising balance. This result is inconsistent with sensory reweighting based on disturbances. The increase in sway with increased sensory gain is also inconsistent with a simple feedback model of vestibular reflex action. Thus, we propose that recalibration of a forward sensory model best explains the reinterpretation of an altered reafferent signal of head motion during stable balance."

  "title": "Impact of body tilt on the central aortic pressure pulse",
  "date": "2015 Apr",
  "abstract": "The present work was undertaken to investigate, in young healthy volunteers, the relationships between the forward propagation times of arterial pressure waves and the timing of reflected waves observable on the aortic pulse, in the course of rapid changes in body position. 20 young healthy subjects, 10 men, and 10 women, were examined on a tilt table at two different tilt angles, -10° (Head-down) and + 45° (Head-up). In each position, carotid-femoral (Tcf) and carotid-tibial forward propagation times (Tct) were measured with the Complior device. In each position also, the central aortic pressure pulse was recorded with radial tonometry, using the SphygmoCor device and a generalized transfer function, so as to evaluate the timing of reflected waves reaching the aorta in systole (onset of systolic reflected wave, sT1r) and diastole (mean transit time of diastolic reflected wave, dMTT). The position shift from Head-up to Head-down caused a massive increase in both Tct (women from 130 ± 10 to 185 ± 18 msec P < 0.001, men from 136 ± 9 to 204 ± 18 msec P < 0.001) and dMTT (women from 364 ± 35 to 499 ± 33 msec P < 0.001, men from 406 ± 22 to 553 ± 21 msec P < 0.001). Mixed model regression showed that the changes in Tct and dMTT observed between Head-up and Head-down were tightly coupled (regression coefficient 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.9-2.3, P < 0.001). These results strongly suggest that the diastolic waves observed on central aortic pulses reconstructed from radial tonometric correspond at least in part to reflections generated in the lower limbs."

  "title": "Using Kalman Filtering to Predict Time-Varying Parameters in a Model Predicting Baroreflex Regulation During Head-Up Tilt",
  "date": "2015 Aug",
  "abstract": "The cardiovascular control system is continuously engaged to maintain homeostasis, but it is known to fail in a large cohort of patients suffering from orthostatic intolerance. Numerous clinical studies have been put forward to understand how the system fails, yet noninvasive clinical data are sparse, typical studies only include measurements of heart rate and blood pressure, as a result it is difficult to determine what mechanisms that are impaired. It is known, that blood pressure regulation is mediated by changes in heart rate, vascular resistance, cardiac contractility, and a number of other factors. Given that numerous factors contribute to changing these quantities, it is difficult to devise a physiological model describing how they change in time. One way is to build a model that allows these controlled quantities to change and to compare dynamics between subject groups. To do so, it requires more knowledge of how these quantities change for healthy subjects. This study compares two methods predicting time-varying changes in cardiac contractility and vascular resistance during head-up tilt. Similar to the study by Williams et al. [51], the first method uses piecewise linear splines, while the second uses the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) [1], [11], [12], [33]. In addition, we show that the delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) algorithm can be used for predicting parameter uncertainties within the spline methodology, which is compared with the variability obtained with the ETKF. While the spline method is easier to set up, this study shows that the ETKF has a significantly shorter computational time. Moreover, while uncertainty of predictions can be augmented to spline predictions using DRAM, these are readily available with the ETKF."

  "title": "Postural Consequences of Cervical Sagittal Imbalance: A Novel Laboratory Model",
  "date": "2015 Jun 1",
  "abstract": "Study design: A biomechanical study using human spine specimens.\nObjective: To study postural compensations in lordosis angles that are necessary to maintain horizontal gaze in the presence of forward head posture and increasing T1 sagittal tilt.\nSummary of background data: Forward head posture relative to the shoulders, assessed radiographically using the horizontal offset distance between the C2 and C7 vertebral bodies (C2-C7 [sagittal vertical alignment] SVA), is a measure of global cervical imbalance. This may result from kyphotic alignment of cervical segments, muscle imbalance, as well as malalignment of thoracolumbar spine.\nMethods: Ten cadaveric cervical spines (occiput-T1) were tested. The T1 vertebra was anchored to a tilting and translating base. The occiput was free to move vertically but its angular orientation was constrained to ensure horizontal gaze regardless of sagittal imbalance. A 5-kg mass was attached to the occiput to mimic head weight. Forward head posture magnitude and T1 tilt were varied and motions of individual vertebrae were measured to calculate C2-C7 SVA and lordosis across C0-C2 and C2-C7.\nResults: Increasing C2-C7 SVA caused flexion of lower cervical (C2-C7) segments and hyperextension of suboccipital (C0-C1-C2) segments to maintain horizontal gaze. Increasing kyphotic T1 tilt primarily increased lordosis across the C2-C7 segments. Regression models were developed to predict the compensatory C0-C2 and C2-C7 angulation needed to maintain horizontal gaze given values of C2-C7 SVA and T1 tilt.\nConclusion: This study established predictive relationships between radiographical measures of forward head posture, T1 tilt, and postural compensations in the cervical lordosis angles needed to maintain horizontal gaze. The laboratory model predicted that normalization of C2-C7 SVA will reduce suboccipital (C0-C2) hyperextension, whereas T1 tilt reduction will reduce the hyperextension in the C2-C7 segments. The predictive relationships may help in planning corrective strategy in patients experiencing neck pain, which may be attributed to sagittal malalignment.\nLevel of evidence: N/A."

  "date": "2014 Oct",
  "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of prolonged walking with load carriage on body posture, muscle fatigue, heart rate and blood pressure of the tested subjects. Ten healthy volunteers performed 30 min walking trials on treadmill (speed = 1.1 m/s) with different backpack loads [0% body weight (BW), 10% BW, 15% BW and 20% BW]. The change of body posture, muscle fatigue, heart rate and blood pressure before and after walking and the recovery of muscle fatigue during the rest time (0, 5, 10 and 15 min) were collected using the Bortec AMT-8 and the NDI Optotrak Certus. Results showed that the forward trunk and head angle, muscle fatigue, heart rate and blood pressure increased with the increasing backpack loads and bearing time. With the 20% BW load, the forward angle, muscle fatigue and systolic pressure were significantly higher than with lighter weights. No significantly increased heart rate and diastolic pressure were found. Decreased muscle fatigue was found after removing the backpack in each load trial. But the recovery of the person with 20% BW load was slower than that of 0% BW, 10% BW and 15% BW. These findings indicated that the upper limit of backpack loads for college-aged students should be between 15% BW and 20% BW according to muscle fatigue and forward angle. It is suggested that backpack loads should be restricted to no more than 15% BW for walks of up to 30 min duration to avoid irreversible muscle fatigue."

  "date": "2015 May",
  "abstract": "Technology-aided programs have been reported to help persons with disabilities develop adaptive responding and control problem behavior/posture. This study assessed one such program in which choice of stimulus events was used as adaptive responding for three adults with multiple disabilities. A computer system presented the participants stimulus samples. For each sample, they could perform a choice response (gaining access to the related stimulus whose length they could extend) or abstain from responding (making the system proceed to the next sample). Once choice responding had strengthened, the program also targeted the participants' problem posture (i.e., head and trunk forward bending). The stimulus exposure gained with a choice response was interrupted if the problem posture occurred. All three participants successfully (a) managed choice responses and access to preferred stimuli and (b) gained postural control (i.e., reducing the problem posture to very low levels). The practical implications of those results are discussed."

  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the immediate and long-term effects of a multimodal program, with the addition of forward head posture correction, in patients with chronic discogenic lumbosacral radiculopathy.\nMethods: This randomized clinical study included 154 adult patients (54 females) who experienced chronic discogenic lumbosacral radiculopathy and had forward head posture. One group received a functional restoration program, and the experimental group received forward head posture corrective exercises. Primary outcomes were the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Secondary outcomes included the anterior head translation, lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, trunk inclination, lateral deviation, trunk imbalance, surface rotation, pelvic inclination, leg and back pain scores, and H-reflex latency and amplitude. Patients were assessed at 3 intervals (pretreatment, 10-week posttreatment, and 2-year follow-up).\nResults: A general linear model with repeated measures indicated a significant group × time effect in favor of the experimental group on the measures of ODI (F = 89.7; P < .0005), anterior head translation (F = 23.6; P < .0005), H-reflex amplitude (F = 151.4; P < .0005), H-reflex latency (F = 99.2; P < .0005), back pain (F = 140.8; P < .0005), and leg pain (F = 72; P < .0005). After 10 weeks, the results revealed an insignificant difference between the groups for ODI (P = .08), back pain (P = .29), leg pain (P = .019), H-reflex amplitude (P = .09), and H-reflex latency (P = .098). At the 2-year follow-up, there were significant differences between the groups for all variables adopted for this study (P < .05).\nConclusions: The addition of forward head posture correction to a functional restoration program seemed to positively affect disability, 3-dimensional spinal posture parameters, back and leg pain, and S1 nerve root function of patients with chronic discogenic lumbosacral radiculopathy."

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two treatment approaches scapular stabilization based exercise therapy and physical therapy in patients with SIS.\nMethods: The study is a randomized clinical trial in which 68 patients with SIS were randomly assigned in two groups of exercise therapy (ET) and physical therapy (PT) and received 18 sessions of treatment. Pain, shoulders' range of abduction and external rotation, shoulder protraction, scapular rotation and symmetry as well as postural assessment and Pectoralis minor length were evaluated pre and post intervention. The paired-sample t test and the independent sample t test were applied respectively to determine the differences in each group and between two groups.\nResults: Our findings indicated significant differences in abduction and external rotation range, improvement of forward shoulder translation and increase in the flexibility of the involved shoulder between the two groups (respectively ; p=0.024, p=0.001, p<0/0001, p<0/0001). No significant difference was detected in pain reduction between the groups (p=0.576). Protraction of the shoulder (p<0.0001), forward head posture (p<0/0001) and mid thoracic curvature (p<0.0001) revealed a significant improvement in the ET group. Apparent changes occurred in scapular rotation and symmetry in both groups but no significant differences were observed between the two groups (respectively; p=0.183, p=0.578).\nConclusion: The scapular stabilization based exercise intervention was successful in increasing shoulder range, decreasing forward head and shoulder postures and Pectoralis minor flexibility."

  "date": "2015 Sep",
  "abstract": "The kinematics and kinetics of head impact due to a standing fall onto a hard surface are summarized. Head injury due to impact from falls represents a significant problem, especially for older individuals. When the head is left unprotected during a fall, the impact severity can be high enough to cause significant injury or even death. To ascertain the range of head impact parameters, the dynamic response was captured for the pedestrian version of the 5th percentile female and 50th percentile male Hybrid III anthropomorphic test dummies as they were dropped from a standing position with different initial postures. Five scenarios of falls were considered including backward falls with/without hip flexion, forward falls with/without knee flexion and lateral falls. The results show that the head impact parameters are dependent on the fall scenario. A wide range of impact parameters was observed in 107 trials. The 95% prediction interval for the peak translational acceleration, peak angular acceleration, peak force, impact translational velocity and peak angular velocity are 146-502 g, 8.8-43.3 krad/s(2), 3.9-24.5 kN, 2.02-7.41 m/s, and 12.9-70.3 rad/s, respectively."

  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to explore the effect of a forward sloping seat on posture and muscular activity of the trunk and lower limbs. To this aim, twelve asymptomatic participants were tested in six conditions varying seat slope (0°, 15° forward) and height (high, medium, low). Angular position of head, trunk and pelvis was assessed with an inertial orientation system, and muscular activity of 11 superficial postural muscles located in the trunk and lower limbs was estimated using normalized EMG. Results showed that a forward sloping seat, compared to a flat seat, induced a greater activity of the soleus (p<0.01), vastus lateralis (p<0.05) and vastus medialis (p<0.05), as well a lower hip flexion (p<0.01). In contrast, no significant variation of head, trunk and pelvis angular position was observed according to seat slope. It was concluded that forward sloping seats increase the load sustained by the lower limbs, without a systematic improvement of body posture."

Four parameters (distance among head, cervical spines, and shoulder, and cervical angle) were measured from lateral view of cervical spine X-ray. The location and number of trigger points in the neck and shoulder and symptom duration were evaluated for each patient.\nResults: Both horizontal distances between C1 vertebral body and C7 spinous process and between the earhole and C7 vertebral body were negatively correlated with cervical angle reflecting cervical lordosis (p<0.05). Younger patients had significantly (p<0.05) less cervical angle with more forward head posture. There was no relationship between MPS (presence, location, and number of trigger points) and radiologic assessments (distance parameters and the cervical angle).\nConclusion: Forward head posture and reduced cervical lordosis were seen more in younger patients with spontaneous neck pain. However, these abnormalities did not correlate with the location or the number of MPS. Further studies are needed to delineate the mechanism of neck pain in patients with forward head posture."

  "date": "2015",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of forward trunk lean on hamstring muscle kinematics during sprinting. Eight male sprinters performed maximal-effort sprints in two trunk positions: forward lean and upright. A three-dimensional musculoskeletal model was used to compute the musculotendon lengths and velocity of the biceps femoris long head, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles during the sprinting gait cycle. The musculotendon lengths of all the three hamstring muscles at foot strike and toe-off were significantly greater during the forward trunk lean sprint than during the upright trunk sprint. In addition, a positive peak musculotendon lengthening velocity was observed in the biceps femoris long head and semimembranosus muscles during the late stance phase, and musculotendon lengths at that instant were significantly greater during the forward trunk lean sprint than during the upright trunk sprint. The present study provides significant evidence that a potential for hamstring muscle strain injury involving forward trunk lean sprinting would exist during the stance phase. The results also indicate that the biceps femoris long head and semimembranosus muscles are stretched during forward trunk lean sprinting while contracting eccentrically in the late stance phase; thus, the elongation load on these muscles could be increased."

  "abstract": "Background: Chiari I malformations (CM I) are rare hindbrain herniations. Dysphagia and other oropharyngeal dysfunctions may be associated with CM I, but to our knowledge, no clinical presentation similar to ours has ever been reported. The purpose of this communication is to draw attention to a unique and atypical clinical presentation of a child with CM I.\nCase presentation: A 7-year-old boy was evaluated for a two month history of atypical movements which would occur in the evening, and last for an hour after eating. These stereotypical movements with the head and chest bending forward and to the left side, accompanied by a grimace, were associated with sensation of breath locking without cyanosis. Pain and dysphagia were absent. The neurological examination was normal. The possibility of Sandifer syndrome posturing occurring with gastroesophageal reflux disease was considered but neither pain nor back hyperextension were associated with the atypical movements. Neither proton pump inhibitors (PPI) nor prokinetic agents improved his symptoms. Upper endoscopy and esophageal biopsy did not reveal eosinophilic esophagitis nor reflux esophagitis. Ear, throat and nose (ENT) exam was normal. A severe gastroparesis was demonstrated on milk scan study. Two 24 hour oesophageal pH probe studies pointed out severe gastroesophageal reflux (GER). High resolution manometric evaluation of the oesophagus revealed normal sphincter pressures and relaxations with no dysmotility of the esophageal body. Electroencephalography and polysomnography were normal. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and revealed a CM I: cerebellar tonsils extending to 12 mm, with syringomyelia (D4-D5). For a long period of time, the child's abnormal movements were considered to be nothing but tics and the CM I a fortuitous finding. Since the child remained symptomatic despite medical treatment, it was decided to proceed with surgery. One year after the onset of his symptoms, he underwent posterior fossa decompression with upper cervical laminectomy and expansion duroplasty. Postoperative MRI confirmed adequate decompression. His atypical posture and dyspnea completely resolved after surgery and he remains asymptomatic two years later.\nConclusion: Children may have atypical presentations of CM I. Thus, CM I diagnosis should be considered in unexplained atypical oropharyngeal dysfunctions."

Sagittal head, cervical, and shoulder angles were measured with photogrammetry and the Postural Assessment Software.\nResults: For interrater reliability, all of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values for the 3 angles were higher than 0.85. For intrarater reliability, the ICC values for the sagittal head angle, shoulder angle, and cervical angle were 0.83, 0.78, and 0.66, respectively. Mean values of sagittal head, cervical, and shoulder angles were 17.2° ± 5.7°, 47.4° ± 5.2°, and 51.4° ± 8.5°, respectively. Anterior head carriage was demonstrated by 68% of the adolescents, whereas 58% had protraction of the shoulder(s). Males had significantly higher mean cervical and sagittal head angles.\nConclusions: Forward head posture and protracted shoulders were common postural disorders in adolescents 15 to 17 years old, with females revealing a lower mean cervical angle. The intrarater and interrater evaluation of standing sagittal posture of the cervical spine and shoulders by photogrammetry was reliable."

  "abstract": "The present study investigated the existence of a relationship between depression and body posture in 40 women, aged between 20 and 30 years, who had normal body mass indices (or were underweight) and absence of neurological, psychiatric, or musculoskeletal disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate the existence of a relationship between sadness, depression and the posture represented by the angle of Tales, head inclination, shoulder inclination, and forward head and shoulder protrusion. The degree of depression was rated on analogue scales representing current and usual depression and current and usual sadness and by the Beck Depression Inventory. The results indicated that a relationship exists between: Beck depression and the angle of Tales (p = 0.01), current depression and inclination of the head (p = 0.05) and inclination of the shoulders (p = 0.006), and usual depression and protrusion of the shoulder (p = 0.02). Inclination of the shoulders is associated with current sadness (p = 0.03; r = 0.443) and usual sadness (p = 0.04; r = 0.401). Usual sadness is also associated with protrusion of the shoulder (p = 0.05; r = 0.492). No associations were found with protrusion of the head and the emotional variables assessed. The conclusion was that depression and sadness might possibly change posture. Consequently, postural assessment and treatment may assist in diagnosing and treating depression."

[Results] The shoulder joints, the knee joints, and the calcaneocuboid joint did not show any significant differences, but the head was aligned further forward in the 3-hour group compared to the other groups. In the coronal plane, the acromion processes and the anterior superior iliac spines of the 3-hour group showed statistically significant differences than those of all of the other groups. [Conclusion] The results indicate that sitting with the legs crossed for longer than three hours per day may cause shoulder inclination, lateral pelvic tilt and forward head posture."

  "abstract": "[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of forward head posture (FHP) on proprioception by determining the cervical position-reposition error. [Subjects and Methods] A sample population was divided into two groups in accordance with the craniovertebral angle: the FHP group and the control group. We measured the craniovertebral angle, which is defined as the angle between a horizontal line passing through C7 and a line extending from the tragus of the ear to C7. The error value of the cervical position sense after cervical flexion, extension, and rotation was evaluated using the head repositioning accuracy test. [Results] There were significant differences in the error value of the joint position sense (cervical flexion, extension, and rotation) between the FHP and control groups. In addition, there was an inverse correlation between the craniovertebral angle and error value of the joint position sense. [Conclusion] FHP is associated with reduced proprioception. This result implies that the change in the muscle length caused by FHP decreases the joint position sense. Also, proprioception becomes worse as FHP becomes more severe."

  "abstract": "Background and objective: Actual studies show increasing poor posture especially in the cervical-thoracic spine. The aim of this study was to develop a model-based evaluation of posture and the amount of segmental spinal movement using a simple movement test.\nMethods: Twenty-five subjects with forward head posture were recruited. We were interested in the external humeral rotation with the adduction of the shoulder, its influence on posture of the cervical thoracic spine and the evaluation of upright posture. Upright posture was determined as the change in the gradient of the trunk from forward posture to erect posture. The kinematics of the cervical-thoracic spine and the inclination of the pelvis and thorax were measured in the sagittal plane with a motion analysis system.\nResults: The kinematic model for the evaluation of upright posture and as a control the electromyography was presented. Correlation (Pearson r = 0.89; p < 0.01) was achieved between the gradients of the trunk in the initial and final position.\nConclusion: The postural quality was more important than the quantity of spinal movement. Upright posture of the cervical-thoracic spine was provoked only if there was horizontal position of the pelvis and thorax. This should be considered in clinical practice."

  "title": "An intermittent control model of flexible human gait using a stable manifold of saddle-type unstable limit cycle dynamics",
  "date": "2014 Dec 6",
  "abstract": "Stability of human gait is the ability to maintain upright posture during walking against external perturbations. It is a complex process determined by a number of cross-related factors, including gait trajectory, joint impedance and neural control strategies. Here, we consider a control strategy that can achieve stable steady-state periodic gait while maintaining joint flexibility with the lowest possible joint impedance. To this end, we carried out a simulation study of a heel-toe footed biped model with hip, knee and ankle joints and a heavy head-arms-trunk element, working in the sagittal plane. For simplicity, the model assumes a periodic desired joint angle trajectory and joint torques generated by a set of feed-forward and proportional-derivative feedback controllers, whereby the joint impedance is parametrized by the feedback gains. We could show that a desired steady-state gait accompanied by the desired joint angle trajectory can be established as a stable limit cycle (LC) for the feedback controller with an appropriate set of large feedback gains. Moreover, as the feedback gains are decreased for lowering the joint stiffness, stability of the LC is lost only in a few dimensions, while leaving the remaining large number of dimensions quite stable: this means that the LC becomes saddle-type, with a low-dimensional unstable manifold and a high-dimensional stable manifold. Remarkably, the unstable manifold remains of low dimensionality even when the feedback gains are decreased far below the instability point. We then developed an intermittent neural feedback controller that is activated only for short periods of time at an optimal phase of each gait stride. We characterized the robustness of this design by showing that it can better stabilize the unstable LC with small feedback gains, leading to a flexible gait, and in particular we demonstrated that such an intermittent controller performs better if it drives the state point to the stable manifold, rather than directly to the LC. The proposed intermittent control strategy might have a high affinity for the inverted pendulum analogy of biped gait, providing a dynamic view of how the step-to-step transition from one pendular stance to the next can be achieved stably in a robust manner by a well-timed neural intervention that exploits the stable modes embedded in the unstable dynamics."

  "date": "2014 Aug",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Cervical hyperlordosis is a rare pediatric deformity leading to gaze and postural disturbances. The cornerstone of treatment consists of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) combined with positional traction.\nCase presentation: We report a new surgical approach in a 7-year-old female patient suffering from stiff cervical hyperlordosis, desiring to correct forward head posture as well as gaze disturbance. The patient had a chief complaint of restricted range of motion of the neck for the past 4 years. Posture examination revealed several abnormalities, including apparent thoracic hump with shifting to right side, slight elevation of the right shoulder, with back pain. She also had difficulties performing her assignments. Radiological investigations revealed a 95˚ cervical lordosis and forward head posture (FHP) assessed by two separate measurements. There was no considerable response to conservative treatment, (which included 30 sessions of SMT combined with positional traction). Consequently, she underwent radical resection of cervical paraspinal muscles, followed by halo traction. She was discharged with a halo-vest. Specific instructions for home exercise were provided to the patient. Post-trial radiographs showed a reduction of cervical lordosis to 51˚ and a reduction in FHP of 73 mm. The symptoms were alleviated at the end of the treatment.\nDiscussion: This new approach appeared to correct postural abnormalities, and had an obvious positive effect on the patient's chief complaint."

  "abstract": "Repetitive or prolonged head flexion posture while using a smartphone is known as one of risk factors for pain symptoms in the neck. To quantitatively assess the amount and range of head flexion of smartphone users, head forward flexion angle was measured from 18 participants when they were conducing three common smartphone tasks (text messaging, web browsing, video watching) while sitting and standing in a laboratory setting. It was found that participants maintained head flexion of 33-45° (50th percentile angle) from vertical when using the smartphone. The head flexion angle was significantly larger (p < 0.05) for text messaging than for the other tasks, and significantly larger while sitting than while standing. Study results suggest that text messaging, which is one of the most frequently used app categories of smartphone, could be a main contributing factor to the occurrence of neck pain of heavy smartphone users. Practitioner Summary: In this laboratory study, the severity of head flexion of smartphone users was quantitatively evaluated when conducting text messaging, web browsing and video watching while sitting and standing. Study results indicate that text messaging while sitting caused the largest head flexion than that of other task conditions."

  "title": "Axially evoked postural reflexes: influence of task",
  "date": "2015 Jan",
  "abstract": "Postural reflexes were recorded in healthy subjects (n = 17) using brief axial accelerations and tap stimuli applied at the vertebra prominens (C7) and manubrium sterni. Short latency (SL) responses were recorded from the soleus, hamstrings and tibialis anterior muscles and expressed as a percentage of the background EMG prior to stimulus onset. In the majority of postural conditions tested, subjects were recorded standing erect and leaning forward with their feet together. The SL response was larger for soleus than for the hamstrings during standing (soleus vs hamstrings; 70.4 vs 28.1%), whereas the opposite occurred during kneeling (25.3 vs 127.3%). Concordant head and trunk accelerations produced larger SL responses than discordant accelerations for soleus and hamstrings, but the evoked excitatory response was independent of head direction and as expected for the direction of truncal acceleration. Postural reflexes for soleus and tibialis anterior were strongly affected by conditions that posed a significant threat to postural stability; stimulation at C7 was associated with significant SL enhancement for soleus during anterior lean while sternal stimulation showed SL enhancement for tibialis anterior during posterior lean. Cutaneous anaesthesia applied over the C7 stimulation site had no significant effect on EMG responses, nor did vision or surface type (rigid or compliant). This study provides further evidence that postural reflexes produced by brief axial accelerations are independent of cutaneous receptors, vestibular afferents and ankle proprioceptors, and demonstrates that postural tasks and truncal orientation significantly affect the evoked response, consistent with a role in stabilising posture."

  "title": "The relationship of forward head posture and rounded shoulders with neck pain in Iranian office workers",
  "date": "2014 May 3",
  "abstract": "Background Office workers spend a long period of time behind a computer during working hours. The relation between the posture of sitting during work with computer and neck pain is still debatable. Even though some researchers claim a significant difference in head posture between patients with neck pain and pain-free participants, the FHP (forward head posture) has not always been associated with neck pain in literature. So, the purpose of this study was to discover the relationship between neck pain and improper posture in the head, cervicothoracic spine and shoulders.\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional study to explore the relationships between neck pains, sagittal postures of cervical and thoracic spine and shoulders among office workers in two positions, straight looking forward and working position. 46 subjects without neck pain and 55 subjects with neck pain were evaluated using a photographic method. Thoracic and cervical postures were measured by the HT (High Thoracic), CV (Craniovertebral) angles respectively. Shoulder's posture was evaluated in the sagittal plane by the acromion protrusion.\nResults: HT and CV angles were positively correlated with the presence of neck pain only in working position (p< 0.05). In straight looking forward position there was no significant difference between the two groups statistically (p>0.05). The difference of shoulder protrusion between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups was not significant.\nConclusion: FHP and thoracic kyphosis were accompanied with neck pain. But shoulder posture was not correlated with neck pain."

  "title": "A method to model anticipatory postural control in driver braking events",
  "date": "2014 Sep",
  "abstract": "Human body models (HBMs) for vehicle occupant simulations have recently been extended with active muscles and postural control strategies. Feedback control has been used to model occupant responses to autonomous braking interventions. However, driver postural responses during driver initiated braking differ greatly from autonomous braking. In the present study, an anticipatory postural response was hypothesized, modelled in a whole-body HBM with feedback controlled muscles, and validated using existing volunteer data. The anticipatory response was modelled as a time dependent change in the reference value for the feedback controllers, which generates correcting moments to counteract the braking deceleration. The results showed that, in 11 m/s(2) driver braking simulations, including the anticipatory postural response reduced the peak forward displacement of the head by 100mm, of the shoulder by 30 mm, while the peak head flexion rotation was reduced by 18°. The HBM kinematic response was within a one standard deviation corridor of corresponding test data from volunteers performing maximum braking. It was concluded that the hypothesized anticipatory responses can be modelled by changing the reference positions of the individual joint feedback controllers that regulate muscle activation levels. The addition of anticipatory postural control muscle activations appears to explain the difference in occupant kinematics between driver and autonomous braking. This method of modelling postural reactions can be applied to the simulation of other driver voluntary actions, such as emergency avoidance by steering."

  "date": "2014 Dec",
  "abstract": "The tilt-translation ambiguity occurs because acceleration due to translation cannot be differentiated from gravitational acceleration. Head tilt can occur independent of body tilt which further complicates the problem. The tilt-translation ambiguity is examined for fore-aft (surge) translation with head and/or body orientations that are tilted in pitch 10° forward or backward. Eleven human subjects (six female), mean age 40 years participated. Conditions included no tilt (NT), head and body tilt (HBT), head only tilt (HOT), and body only tilt (BOT). The fore-aft stimulus consisted of a 2 s (0.5 Hz) sine wave in acceleration which a maximum peak velocity of 10 cm/s. After each stimulus, the subject reported the direction of motion as forward or backward. Subsequent stimuli were adjusted to determine the point at which subjects were equally likely to report motion in either direction. During the HBT, responses were biased such that upward pitch caused a neutral stimulus to be more likely to be perceived as forward and downward pitch caused the stimulus to be more likely to be perceived as backward. The difference in the point of subjective equality based on the direction of tilt was 3.3 cm/s. During the BOT condition, the bias with respect to the direction of body tilt was in a similar direction with a difference in PSE 1.6 cm/s. During HOT and NT, there was no significant bias on fore-aft perception. These findings demonstrate that body tilt shifts the PSE of fore-aft direction discrimination while head tilt has no influence."

  "date": "2014 Winter",
  "abstract": "Background: Heroin is an extremely addictive narcotic drug derived from morphine. Its continued use requires increased amounts of the drug to achieve the same effect, resulting in tolerance and addiction. This study was done in order to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain and forward head posture among heroin users during their withdrawal.\nMethods: This research was a cross-sectional study that was done on 90 heroin users (83 males, 7 females) aged between 20 to 40 years (32.5 ± 3.81) during their withdrawal in Shiraz, Iran. They were selected by simple randomized sampling. Data were collected by a form regarding age, sex, the duration of heroin use, and musculoskeletal pain. Pain was measured by VAS (visual analog scale) and forward head posture was evaluated by plumb line. Pearson correlation technique and chi-square were used for analyzing the data.\nFindings: The results revealed that the majority of heroin users suffered from musculoskeletal pain during their withdrawal. At the end of withdrawal 53.4% had severe pain, 38.8% had moderate pain, and 7.8% of them had mild pain. Pain in the lower extremities and low back was more common than the upper extremities. The intensity of pain before withdrawal was mild, during withdrawal was moderate, and at the end was sever, but there was no significant correlation between them. The results also showed 43.3% of subjects had normal posture and 56.7% had forward posture.\nConclusion: According to the results, the intensity of pain increased during the withdrawal period; therefore, more attention must be paid to this complication in heroin users for better evaluation and a successful withdrawal."

  "date": "2014 Aug 18",
  "abstract": "We address the hypothesis that postures adopted during grammatical pauses in speech production are more \"mechanically advantageous\" than absolute rest positions for facilitating efficient postural motor control of vocal tract articulators. We quantify vocal tract posture corresponding to inter-speech pauses, absolute rest intervals as well as vowel and consonant intervals using automated analysis of video captured with real-time magnetic resonance imaging during production of read and spontaneous speech by 5 healthy speakers of American English. We then use locally-weighted linear regression to estimate the articulatory forward map from low-level articulator variables to high-level task/goal variables for these postures. We quantify the overall magnitude of the first derivative of the forward map as a measure of mechanical advantage. We find that postures assumed during grammatical pauses in speech as well as speech-ready postures are significantly more mechanically advantageous than postures assumed during absolute rest. Further, these postures represent empirical extremes of mechanical advantage, between which lie the postures assumed during various vowels and consonants. Relative mechanical advantage of different postures might be an important physical constraint influencing planning and control of speech production."

  "date": "2015 Jan 1",
  "abstract": "Background context: Neck muscle responses after unexpected rear-end collisions consist of a stereotypical combination of postural and startle responses. Prior work using surface electromyography (EMG) has shown that the superficial neck muscle responses can be attenuated when a loud tone (105 dB) is presented 250 milliseconds before impact, but the accompanying response of the deeper multifidus muscles remains unknown. Quantifying this response in multifidus is important because this muscle attaches directly to the cervical facet capsule and can potentially increase the strain in the capsule during an impact and contribute to whiplash injury.\nPurpose: To investigate if a loud preimpact tone decreases the cervical multifidus muscle response during rear-end perturbations.\nStudy design: After approval by the University Clinical Ethics Review Board, human volunteers experienced a series of three whiplash-like perturbations.\nPatient sample: Twelve subjects with no history of neurologic disorders or whiplash injury were recruited to participate in this experiment.\nOutcome measures: Bilateral indwelling EMG of multifidus at the C4 and C6 levels, surface EMG of sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and C4 paraspinals (PARAs), and kinematics of the head/neck were measured.\nMethods: Subjects experienced three whiplash-like perturbations (peak acceleration of 19.5 m/s(2)) preceded by either no tone or a loud tone (105 dB) presented 250 milliseconds before sled acceleration onset.\nResults: The loud tone decreased the muscle activity of C6 multifidus (42%) and C4 PARAs (30%), but did not affect the C4 multifidus or SCM activity. Peak head kinematic responses (extension angle: 6%, retraction: 9%, linear forward acceleration: 9%, and angular acceleration in extension: 13%) were also decreased by the loud preimpact tone.\nConclusions: The attenuation of peak C6 multifidus activity and head kinematic responses suggests that a loud preimpact tone may reduce the strain in the cervical facet capsule, which may reduce the risk of whiplash injury during rear-end collisions."

Standing postural alignments were assessed using 2-dimensional analyses with a digital video camera. The time up and go test (TUG) and other physical function tests were conducted.\nResults: Decreased lower cervical angle (increased forward head position) was significantly correlated with increased upper cervical angle (increased chin-up, r = −0.45), increased thoracic spine angle (increased kyphosis, r = −0.38), and decreased lumbar spine angle (thoracolumbar segments backward relative to the pelvis, r = 0.48). The decreased lumbar spine angle was significantly correlated with increased thoracic angle (increased kyphosis, r = −0.37), increased pelvic plane angle (increased anterior pelvic tilt, r = −0.49), and decreased knee flexion angle (r = 0.46). Increased TUG time (slower walking speed) was correlated to increased forward head position (r = 0.30) and thoracolumbar segments forward relative to the pelvis (r = 0.34).\nConclusions: Posture and physical function measures were provided for community-dwelling females who were >65 years of age. They did not demonstrate any correlation between measured knee strength, back strength or single leg standing with measures of postural alignment, but TUG showed a moderate correlation with the lower cervical and lumbar spine posture measures."

Sagittal head, cervical, and shoulder angles were measured with photogrammetry and PAS software. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Assessment (ASES) was used to assess shoulder pain, whereas neck pain was self-reported with a single question.\nResults: Mean values of sagittal head, cervical, and shoulder angles were 17.2±5.7, 47.4±5.2, and 51.4±8.5º, respectively. 68% of the participants revealed protraction of the head, whereas 58% of them had protraction of the shoulder. The boys showed a significantly higher mean cervical angle, and adolescents with neck pain revealed lower mean cervical angle than adolescents without neck pain. 53% of the girls self-reported regular neck pain, contrasting with 19% of the boys.\nConclusions: This data shows that forward head and protracted shoulder are common postural disorders in adolescents, especially in girls. Neck pain is prevalent in adolescents, especially girls, and it is associated with forward head posture."

  "abstract": "The Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a condition in which heart rate increases abnormally when the individual assumes an upright position. In addition to the marked tachycardia, presyncope, and syncope, patients with POTS often complain of light-headedness, fatigue, and difficulty in concentrating. The present study assessed individuals with POTS for psychiatric comorbidity, anxiety sensitivity and health related quality of life and examined general cognitive ability. Data was obtained from patients with POTS (n = 15, 12 female, aged 30 ± 3 years) and age matched healthy subjects (n = 30, 21 female, aged 32 ± 2 years). Patients with POTS commonly presented with symptoms of depression, elevated anxiety and increased anxiety sensitivity, particularly with regards to cardiac symptoms, and had a poorer health related quality of life in both the physical and mental health domains. While patients with POTS performed worse in tests of current intellectual functioning (verbal and non-verbal IQ) and in measures of focused attention (digits forward) and short term memory (digits back), test results were influenced largely by years of education and the underlying level of depression and anxiety. Acute changes in cognitive performance in response to head up tilt were evident in the POTS patients. From results obtained, it was concluded that participants with POTS have an increased prevalence of depression and higher levels of anxiety. These underlying symptoms impact on cognition in patients with POTS, particularly in the cognitive domains of attention and short-term memory. Our results indicate that psychological interventions may aid in recovery and facilitate uptake and adherence of other treatment modalities in patients with POTS."

  "abstract": "Background: It is assumed that good postural alignment is associated with the less likelihood of musculoskeletal pain symptoms. Encouraging good sitting postures have not reported consequent musculoskeletal pain reduction in school-based populations, possibly due to a lack of clear understanding of good posture. Therefore this paper describes the variability of postural angles in a cohort of asymptomatic high-school students whilst working on desk-top computers in a school computer classroom and to report on the relationship between the postural angles and age, gender, height, weight and computer use.\nMethods: The baseline data from a 12 month longitudinal study is reported. The study was conducted in South African school computer classrooms. 194 Grade 10 high-school students, from randomly selected high-schools, aged 15-17 years, enrolled in Computer Application Technology for the first time, asymptomatic during the preceding month, and from whom written informed consent were obtained, participated in the study. The 3D Posture Analysis Tool captured five postural angles (head flexion, neck flexion, cranio-cervical angle, trunk flexion and head lateral bend) while the students were working on desk-top computers. Height, weight and computer use were also measured. Individual and combinations of postural angles were analysed.\nResults: 944 Students were screened for eligibility of which the data of 194 students are reported. Trunk flexion was the most variable angle. Increased neck flexion and the combination of increased head flexion, neck flexion and trunk flexion were significantly associated with increased weight and BMI (p = 0.0001).\nConclusions: High-school students sit with greater ranges of trunk flexion (leaning forward or reclining) when using the classroom computer. Increased weight is significantly associated with increased sagittal plane postural angles."

Ultrasound images were recorded and speckle tracking analysis was used to quantify muscle deformation and deformation rate over 3 equal time-periods during the lifting sequence (rest, mid-lift and end-lift).\nResults: Significant main effects of postural orientation for the deformation measure (p < 0.05) and time for the deformation rate measure (p < 0.05) were observed in all dorsal muscles examined. Significant time by postural interactions for the deformation measure were observed in the trapezius, semispinalis cervicis and multifidus (p < 0.05) and in the semispinalis cervicis (p < 0.05) for the deformation rate measure.\nConclusion: Speckle tracking analysis ultrasound measurements can detect differences in multilayered muscle activity of the dorsal neck induced by postural variations during a lifting task. Findings for the deformation and the deformation rate measures suggest that they quantify a different, albeit related, mechanical event during muscle contraction in a functional task such as lifting."

  "title": "Effect of a worktable position on head and shoulder posture and shoulder muscles in manual material handling",
  "date": "2015 Jun 5",
  "abstract": "Background: According to a recent research, manual working with high levels of static contraction, repetitive loads, or extreme working postures involving the neck and shoulder muscles causes an increased risk of neck and shoulder musculoskeletal disorders.\nObjective: We investigated the effects of the forwardly worktable position on head and shoulder angles and shoulder muscle activity in manual material handling tasks.\nMethods: The forward head and shoulder angles and the activity of upper trapezius, levator scapulae, and middle deltoid muscle activities of 15 workers were measured during performing of manual material handling in two tasks that required different forward head and shoulder angles.\nResults: The second manual material task required a significantly increased forward head and shoulder angle. The upper trapezius and levator scapulae muscle activity in second manual material task was increased significantly compared with first manual material task. The middle deltoid muscle activity in second manual material task was not significantly different compared with first manual material task.\nConclusions: Based on this result, the forward head and shoulder angles while performing manual work need to be considered in selection of the forward distance of a worktable form the body. The high level contractions of the neck and shoulder muscles correlated with neck and shoulder pain. Therefore, the forward distance of a worktable can be an important factor in preventing neck and shoulder pain in manual material handling workers."

  "date": "2014",
  "abstract": "Objective: A series of sled tests was performed using vehicle seats and Hybrid-III 6-year-old (6YO) and 10YO anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) to explore possibilities for improving occupant protection for children who are not using belt-positioning booster seats.\nMethods: Cushion length was varied from production length of 450 mm to a shorter length of 350 mm. Lap belt geometry was set to rear, mid, and forward anchorage locations that span the range of lap belt angles found in vehicles. Six tests each were performed with the 6YO and 10YO Hybrid III ATDs. One additional test was performed using a booster seat with the 6YO. The ATDs were positioned using an updated version of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) seating procedure that positions the ATD hips further forward with longer seat cushions to reflect the effect of cushion length on posture that has been measured with child volunteers. ATD kinematics were evaluated using peak head excursion, peak knee excursion, the difference between peak head and peak knee excursion, and the maximum torso angle.\nResults: Shortening the seat cushion improved kinematic outcomes, particularly for the 10YO. Lap belt geometry had a greater effect on kinematics with the longer cushion length, with mid or forward belt geometries producing better kinematics than the rearward belt geometry. The worst kinematics for both ATDs occurred with the long cushion length and rearward lap belt geometry. The improvements in kinematics from shorter cushion length or more forward belt geometry are smaller than those provided by a booster seat.\nConclusions: The results show potential benefits in occupant protection from shortening cushion length and increasing lap belt angles, particularly for children the size of the 10YO ATD."

  "abstract": "Objective: To compare the effects of exergaming with conventional weight-shift training on balance function in patients with chronic stroke.\nDesign: Single-blind randomized controlled trial.\nSetting: Medical center.\nParticipants: Patients (N=30) with chronic stroke and balance deficits.\nInterventions: Twelve weeks of Wii Fit training or conventional weight-shift training.\nMain outcome measures: Static balance was assessed using posturography. We recorded the stability index and percentage of weight bearing on the affected leg in 8 positions. We also used the timed Up and Go and forward reach tests for dynamic balance evaluation, Falls Efficacy Scale-International for fear of falling assessment, and Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale for estimating the enjoyment of training.\nResults: The exergaming group showed more improvement in stability index than the control group in head straight with eyes open while standing on a foam surface, eyes closed while standing on a solid surface with head turned 30° to the left, and eyes closed while standing on a solid surface with head turned up positions (time-group interaction P=.02, .04, and .03, respectively); however, the effects were not maintained. At 3-month follow-up, the control group showed more improvement in weight-bearing symmetry in the head straight with eyes open while standing on a solid surface position than the exergaming group (time-group interaction P=.03). Both groups showed improvement in the timed Up and Go test, forward reach test, and fear of falling. The improvement in fear of falling was not maintained. The exergaming group enjoyed training more than the control group (P=.03).\nConclusions: Exergaming is enjoyable and effective for patients with chronic stroke."

  "date": "2014 Oct",
  "abstract": "Patients with chronic neck pain exhibit various musculoskeletal deficits and respiratory dysfunction. As there is a link between thoracic and cervical spine motion, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between thoracic spine and chest mobility with respiratory function and neck disability. Nineteen patients with chronic neck pain (7 male, 46.6 ± 10.5 years) and 19 healthy subjects (7 male, 46.5 ± 9.9 years) participated. Spirometry was conducted to determine maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), maximal inspiratory (Pimax) and maximal expiratory pressure (Pemax). Thoracic spine mobility was measured using the Spinal Mouse(®). Chest expansion was assessed by subtracting chest circumference during maximal inspiration and expiration. Neck function was investigated by examining range of motion, forward head posture, neck flexor muscle synergy endurance and self-assessment (Neck disability index (NDI)). Correlation analyses and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted using MVV, Pimax and Pemax as independent variables. Thoracic spine mobility during flexion and chest expansion correlated significantly to MVV (r = 0.45 and 0.42), all neck motions (r between 0.39 and 0.59) and neck muscle endurance (rS = 0.36). Pemax and Pimax were related to NDI (r = -0.58 and -0.46). In the regression models, chest expansion was the only significant predictor for MVV, and Pemax was determined by neck muscle endurance. These results suggest that chronic neck pain patients should improve the endurance of the neck flexor muscles and thoracic spine and chest mobility. Additionally, these patients might benefit from respiratory muscle endurance training, possibly by increasing chest mobility and Pemax."

  "abstract": "Objective: To compare the clinical usefulness of constant rate infusion (CRI) protocols of romifidine with or without butorphanol for sedation of horses.\nStudy design: Prospective 'blinded' controlled trial using block randomization.\nAnimals: Forty healthy Freiberger stallions.\nMethods: The horses received either intravenous (IV) romifidine (loading dose: 80 μg kg(-1) ; infusion: 30 μg kg(-1) hour(-1) ) (treatment R, n = 20) or romifidine combined with butorphanol (romifidine loading: 80 μg kg(-1) ; infusion: 29 μg kg(-1) hour(-1) , and butorphanol loading: 18 μg kg(-1) ; infusion: 25 μg kg(-1) hour(-1) ) (treatment RB, n = 20). Twenty-one horses underwent dentistry and ophthalmic procedures, while 19 horses underwent only ophthalmologic procedure and buccal examination. During the procedure, physiologic parameters and occurrence of head/muzzle shaking or twitching and forward movement were recorded. Whenever sedation was insufficient, additional romifidine (20 μg kg(-1) ) was administered IV. Recovery time was evaluated by assessing head height above ground. At the end of the procedure, overall quality of sedation for the procedure was scored by the dentist and anaesthetist using a visual analogue scale. Statistical analyses used two-way anova or linear mixed models as relevant.\nResults: Sedation quality scores as assessed by the anaesthetist were R: median 7.55, range: 4.9-9.0 cm, RB: 8.8, 4.7-10.0 cm, and by the dentist R: 6.6, 3.0-8.2 cm, RB: 7.9, 6.6-8.8 cm. Horses receiving RB showed clinically more effective sedation as demonstrated by fewer poor scores and a tendency to reduced additional drug requirements. More horses showed forward movement and head shaking in treatment RB than treatment R. Three horses (two RB, one R) had symptoms of colic following sedation.\nConclusions and clinical relevance: The described protocols provide effective sedation under clinical conditions but for dentistry procedures, the addition of butorphanol is advantageous."

  "date": "2014 May",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Neck pain (NP) is common among military helicopter pilots. Older age and more flight-hours have been associated with pilots with a history of NP. However, modifiable neuromuscular and musculoskeletal characteristics such as neck proprioception, strength, flexibility, and posture have rarely been investigated in military helicopter pilots with a history of NP. The purpose of the study was to compare demographics, flight characteristics, physical fitness information, neck proprioception, strength, flexibility, and posture between helicopter pilots with and without a history of NP.\nMethods: A total of 27 Army helicopter pilots with NP in the past 12 mo (pain group) were matched based on age with pilots without a history of NP (nonpain group). All pilots had flown at least 100 h in the past 12 mo and were cleared for flight and physical training. All pilots completed a battery of laboratory testing: neck proprioception, neck and scapular muscular strength, neck active range-of-motion (ROM), forward head and shoulder posture, and pectoralis minor length. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon tests were used to compare differences between groups.\nResults: The pain group had significantly less cervical extension (63.7 +/- 8.5 degrees) and rotation ROM (R rotation: 67.7 +/- 8.8 degrees; L rotation: 67.4 +/- 9.0 degrees) when compared to the nonpain group (extension: 68.3 +/- 7.4 degrees; R rotation: 73.4 +/- 7.4 degrees; L rotation: 72.9 +/- 6.8 degrees). No significant differences were found for other variables.\nConclusion: The results demonstrate less neck active ROM in pilots with a history of NP. Operating a helicopter with limited neck ROM or NP may negatively impact flight safety and force readiness. Continued research is warranted."

  "title": "Effectuation of adaptive stability and postural alignment strategies are decreased by alcohol intoxication",
  "date": "2014 Jun",
  "abstract": "Human stability control is a complex process comprising contributions from several partly independent mechanisms such as coordination, feedback and feed-forward control, and adaptation. Acute alcohol intoxication impairs these functions and is recognized as a major contributor to fall traumas. The study aimed to investigate how alcohol intoxication at .06% and .10% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) affected the movement spans and control of posture alignment. The angular positions of the head, shoulder, hip and knees relative to the ankles were measured with a 3D motion analysis system in 25 healthy adults during standing with eyes open or closed and with or without vibratory balance perturbations. Alcohol intoxication significantly increased the movement spans of the head, shoulders, hip and knees in anteroposterior and lateral directions during quiet stance (p < or = .047 and p < or = .003) and balance perturbations (p<.001, both directions). Alcohol intoxication also decreased the ability to reduce the movement spans through adaptation in both anteroposterior (p < or = .011) and lateral (p < or = .004) directions. When sober and submitted to balance perturbations, the subjects aligned the head, shoulders, hip and knees more forward relative to the ankle joint (p < .001), hence adopting a more resilient posture increasing the safety margin for backward falls. Alcohol intoxication significantly delayed this forward realignment (p < or = .022). Alcohol intoxication did not cause any significant posture realignment in the lateral direction. Thus, initiation of adaptive posture realignments to alcohol or other disruptions might be context dependent and associated with reaching a certain level of stability threats."

  "date": "2014 Mar",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Falls are important health issues among the elderly people. Most falls in elderly result from abnormal balance control mechanisms. Balance and muscle force generation are directly related, and are associated with age related muscular changes. Studies addressing fall prevention have focused on various group and individualised strength training. However, evidence on strengthening of key muscles necessary for maintaining balance and postural control is lacking.\nObjectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of individualised progressive resistance strength training (PRT) programme in improving balance for forward limits of stability in elderly with balance impairment, compared to traditional balance exercise (TBE), and combination of both (COMBI).\nMaterials and methods: This randomised controlled trial included three groups; 18 subjects in each aged ≥ 65 years, from the elderly care centres of Mangalore city in Southern India (between June 2008 and December 2012). Block randomisation technique was used and allocation concealment was done using sequentially arranged sealed opaque envelopes. The TBE group received 8 component traditional balance exercise; 4 times a week for 6 months. The PRT group received resistance training for the key muscles of lower extremities, using DeLormes and Watkins protocol. The COMBI group received PRT and TBE alternately (2 days of PRT and 2 days of TBE per week). Functional reach test (FRT) was used for measurement of forward limits of stability. The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15.\nResults: For functional reach, PRT group had steady progression from baseline to 6 months (p<0.001). The TBE and COMBI groups showed considerable initial improvement; beyond 3 months, moderate improvement was seen. The changes in scores of FRT were significantly better for PRT than TBE.\nConclusion: Individualised PRT intervention targeting the key muscles of lower limbs is more effective than TBE in improving forward limits of stability among non-frail elderly aged ≥65 years."

  "title": "Effects of the type and direction of support surface perturbation on postural responses",
  "date": "2014 Apr 7",
  "abstract": "Background: Postural control is organized around a task goal. The two most frequently used types of tasks for postural control research are translational (translation along the anterior-posterior axis) and rotational (rotation in sagittal plane) surface perturbations. These types of perturbations rotate the ankle joint, causing different magnitudes and directions of body sway. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the type (translation vs. rotation) and direction (forward/toe up vs. backward/toe down) of the perturbation on postural responses.\nMethod: Nineteen healthy subjects were tested with four perturbations, i.e., forward and backward translation and toe up and toe down rotation. The onset latency and magnitude of muscle activations, angular changes, and COM displacements were measured. In addition, the kinematic data were divided into two phases. The initial phase reflected the balance disturbance induced by the platform movement, and the reversal phase reflected the balance reaction.\nResults: The results showed that, in the initial phase, rotational perturbation induced earlier ankle movement and faster and larger vertical COM displacement, while translational and forward/toe up perturbations induced larger head and trunk angular change and faster and larger horizontal COM displacement. In the reversal phase, balance reaction was attained by multi-joint movements. Translational and forward/toe up perturbations that induced larger upper body instability evoked faster muscle activation as well as faster and larger hip or knee joint movements.\nConclusions: These findings provide insights into an appropriate support surface perturbation for the evaluation and training of balance."

  "date": "2014 Jul 1",
  "abstract": "Modulation of short-term emotions by long-term mood is little understood but relevant to understand the affective system and of importance in respect to animal welfare: a negative mood might taint experiences, whilst a positive mood might alleviate single negative events. To induce different mood states in sheep housing conditions were varied. Fourteen ewes were group-housed in an unpredictable, stimulus-poor and 15 ewes in a predictable, stimulus-rich environment. Sheep were tested individually for mood in a behavioural cognitive bias paradigm. Also, their reactions to three physical stimuli thought to differ in their perceived valence were observed (negative: pricking, intermediate: slight pressure, positive: kneading). General behaviour, activity, ear movements and positions, and haemodynamic changes in the cortical brain were recorded during stimulations. Generalised mixed-effects models and model probabilities based on the BIC (Bayesian information criterion) were used. Only weak evidence for mood difference was found. Sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor housing condition had a somewhat more negative cognitive bias, showed slightly more aversive behaviour, were slightly more active and moved their ears somewhat more. Sheep most clearly differentiated the negative from the intermediate and positive stimulus in that they exhibited more aversive behaviour, less nibbling, were more active, showed more ear movements, more forward ear postures, fewer backward ear postures, and a stronger decrease in deoxyhaemoglobin when subjected to the negative stimulus. In conclusion, sheep reacted towards stimuli according to their presumed valence but their mood was not strongly influenced by housing conditions. Therefore, behavioural reactions and cortical brain activity towards the stimuli were hardly modulated by housing conditions."

Multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures was employed. Obese children showed increased trunk and head forward inclination angle, gait cycle duration and stance phase, decreased swing phase, and increased ground reaction force in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions when compared with male children with a normal body weight. The changes were observed even with an empty backpack in comparison with normal body weight children and a 15% increase in backpack weight led to further instability and damage on their already strained bodies."

  "date": "2014",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Whiplash-associated disorders (WADs), or whiplash injuries, due to low-severity vehicle crashes are of great concern in motorized countries and it is well established that the risk of such injuries is higher for females than for males, even in similar crash conditions. Recent protective systems have been shown to be more beneficial for males than for females. Hence, there is a need for improved tools to address female WAD prevention when developing and evaluating the performance of whiplash protection systems. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a finite element model of a 50th percentile female rear impact crash test dummy.\nMethods: The anthropometry of the 50th percentile female was specified based on literature data. The model, called EvaRID (female rear impact dummy), was based on the same design concept as the existing 50th percentile male rear impact dummy, the BioRID II. A scaling approach was developed and the first version, EvaRID V1.0, was implemented. Its dynamic response was compared to female volunteer data from rear impact sled tests.\nResults: The EvaRID V1.0 model and the volunteer tests compared well until ∼250 ms of the head and T1 forward accelerations and rearward linear displacements and of the head rearward angular displacement. Markedly less T1 rearward angular displacement was found for the EvaRID model compared to the female volunteers. Similar results were received for the BioRID II model when comparing simulated responses with experimental data under volunteer loading conditions. The results indicate that the biofidelity of the EvaRID V1.0 and BioRID II FE models have limitations, predominantly in the T1 rearward angular displacement, at low velocity changes (7 km/h). The BioRID II model was validated against dummy test results in a loading range close to consumer test conditions (EuroNCAP) and lower severity levels of volunteer testing were not considered.\nConclusions: The EvaRID dummy model demonstrated the potential of becoming a valuable tool when evaluating and developing seats and whiplash protection systems. However, updates of the joint stiffness will be required to provide better correlation at lower load levels. Moreover, the seated posture, curvature of the spine, and head position of 50th percentile female occupants needs to be established and implemented in future models."

  "title": "Static and dynamic posture control in postlingual cochlear implanted patients: effects of dual-tasking, visual and auditory inputs suppression",
  "date": "2014 Jan 16",
  "abstract": "Posture control is based on central integration of multisensory inputs, and on internal representation of body orientation in space. This multisensory feedback regulates posture control and continuously updates the internal model of body's position which in turn forwards motor commands adapted to the environmental context and constraints. The peripheral localization of the vestibular system, close to the cochlea, makes vestibular damage possible following cochlear implant (CI) surgery. Impaired vestibular function in CI patients, if any, may have a strong impact on posture stability. The simple postural task of quiet standing is generally paired with cognitive activity in most day life conditions, leading therefore to competition for attentional resources in dual-tasking, and increased risk of fall particularly in patients with impaired vestibular function. This study was aimed at evaluating the effects of postlingual cochlear implantation on posture control in adult deaf patients. Possible impairment of vestibular function was assessed by comparing the postural performance of patients to that of age-matched healthy subjects during a simple postural task performed in static (stable platform) and dynamic (platform in translation) conditions, and during dual-tasking with a visual or auditory memory task. Postural tests were done in eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions, with the CI activated (ON) or not (OFF). Results showed that the postural performance of the CI patients strongly differed from the controls, mainly in the EC condition. The CI patients showed significantly reduced limits of stability and increased postural instability in static conditions. In dynamic conditions, they spent considerably more energy to maintain equilibrium, and their head was stabilized neither in space nor on trunk: they behaved dynamically without vision like an inverted pendulum while the controls showed a whole body rigidification strategy. Hearing (prosthesis on) as well as dual-tasking did not really improve the dynamic postural performance of the CI patients. We conclude that CI patients become strongly visual dependent mainly in challenging postural conditions, a result they have to be awarded of particularly when getting older."

  "date": "2014 Apr",
  "abstract": "This study asked whether individual differences in the influence of vision on postural stability could be used to predict the strength of subsequently induced visual illusions of self-motion (vection). In the experiment, we first measured spontaneous postural sway while subjects stood erect for 60 s with their eyes both open and both closed. We then showed our subjects two types of self-motion display: radially expanding optic flow (simulating constant velocity forwards self-motion) and vertically oscillating radially expanding optic flow (simulating constant velocity forwards self-motion combined with vertical head oscillation). As expected, subjects swayed more with their eyes closed (compared to open) and experienced more compelling illusions of self-motion with vertically oscillating (as opposed to smooth) radial flow. The extent to which participants relied on vision for postural stability-measured as the ratio of sway with eyes closed compared to that with eyes open-was found to predict vection strength. However, this was only the case for displays representing smooth self-motion. It seems that for oscillating displays, other factors, such as visual-vestibular interactions, may be more important."

  "abstract": "Background: Sorting mail into racks for postmen is visually demanding work. This can result in backward inclination of their heads, especially more pronounced for those who use progressive addition lenses.\nObjective: To evaluate the effects of customized working spectacles on the physical workload of postmen.\nMethods: Twelve male postmen sorted mail on two occasions: once using their private progressive spectacles and once using customized sorting spectacles with inverted progressive lenses. Postures and movements of the head, upper back, neck, and upper arms were measured by inclinometry. The muscular load of the trapezius was measured by surface electromyography.\nResults: With the customized sorting spectacles, both the backward inclination of the head and backward flexion of the neck were reduced (3°), as well as the muscular load of the right upper trapezius, compared to sorting with private spectacles. However, with the sorting spectacles, there was a tendency for increased neck forward flexion, and increased sorting time.\nConclusion: The reduction in work load may reduce the risk for developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders due to the positive reduction of the backward inclination of the head. But the tendency for increased neck forward flexion may reduce the positive effects. However, the magnitude of the possible reduction is difficult to predict, especially since quantitative data on exposure-response relationships are unknown. Alternative working spectacles with inverted near progressive lenses ought to be evaluated. They should still result in a positive reduced backward inclination of the head and may not cause any increased forward flexion."

  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the relationship between head posture and anteroposterior skeletal patterns in female adult patients.\nMethods: The study included 75 lateral cephalograms of orthodontic patients in the age range of 18-25 years. The study was conducted from May 2012 to January 2013 at the College of Dentistry, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The lateral cephalograms were divided into 3 groups based on the anterior-posterior skeletal relationship angle: skeletal class I, II, and III. Twenty-three craniofacial morphological variables were identified and used. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to determine significant differences among the 3 skeletal classifications. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the cervical lordosis angle and the cervical curvature with the postural variables were estimated. Significance was set at the p<0.05 level.\nResults: Significant differences were observed in the mandibular plane inclination between class I and II (p<0.04), and between class II and III (p<0.028). Cervical curvature showed a significance difference between class I and II, and between class I and III (p<0.000). In Class I, II, and III the cervical lordosis angle positively correlated with the upper and middle parts of the cervical column. Cervical curvature correlated negatively with the upper part of the cervical column in class I, while positively correlated in class II and III. The class III group showed a more forward head posture, while the class II group showed a greater head extension.\nConclusion: No clear relationship was found between head posture and the different skeletal patterns, and it does not seem to play a significant role in the development of different anteroposterior skeletal relationships."

  "title": "Postural characterization of adolescent federation basketball players",
  "date": "2014 Sep",
  "abstract": "Background: The adolescent players federated to basketball have a high-level of endurance demand, often overloading the biological tissues and causing biomechanical compensations. Due to the immaturity of their musculoskeletal structures those consequences may influence the growing process and lead to the development of various postural patterns. We aimed to evaluate the postural alignment of the trunk in players.\nMethods: Participants, 74 healthy adolescents: 36 basketball players (BG) and 38 adolescents in control group (CG). First, adolescents were marked with spheres over specific anatomical landmarks. Postural photographs were taken in the sagittal and frontal planes, and analyzed using the free internet Postural Analysis Software to obtain quantitative measures of the head, shoulders, and trunk.\nResults: ANCOVA has revealed significant group effects: players demonstrated greater lateral spinal inclination (P < .008). In the right sagittal plane, the BG had lower angular values of forward head position (P < .02), pelvic ante version (P < .02), vertical alignment of the trunk (P < .02), and thoracic kyphosis (P < .005). The covariate analysis has indicated that age influences the alignments of both the shoulders and the left scapula; and height influences the scapular alignment.\nConclusions: This study has demonstrated that basketball training within federations influences the musculoskeletal system of adolescents and reflects a process of postural adaptations."

  "title": "Does tongue size contribute to risk of airway narrowing in preterm infants sitting in a car safety seat?",
  "date": "2014 Oct",
  "abstract": "Background: Preterm infants are at risk of narrowing of the upper airway while restrained in infant car seats, leading to secondary apnea. However, some infants are able to maintain a normal airway. We hypothesized that this might reflect relatively smaller tongue size.\nMethods: We retrospectively analyzed previously reported respiration-timed lateral radiographs of the upper airways of 17 preterm infants ready for discharge (32.6 ± 1.0 weeks gestation at birth, and 37.8 ± 9.7 days old at study) taken during sleep, first in a car safety seat with an insert that allowed the head to remain upright, and then without the insert, when the head slumped forward. The presence of air above the tongue was used as an index of relative tongue size.\nResults: A smaller airspace around the tongue (relatively larger tongue) was associated with greater narrowing of the upper airway when the head was flexed forward in sleep (p < 0.002). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between baseline airway size and change in airway size (r (2) = 0.16, p = 0.11).\nConclusion: The present study supports the hypothesis that the vulnerability of preterm infants to airways compromise while restrained in a car safety seat may be in part related to relative tongue size."

  "title": "Effect of Deep Cervical Flexor Training vs. Conventional Isometric Training on Forward Head Posture, Pain, Neck Disability Index In Dentists Suffering from Chronic Neck Pain",
  "date": "2013 Oct",
  "abstract": "Neck pain accounts for 15% of all soft tissue problems seen in general practice and are a common reason for referral to physiotherapy treatment. The prevalence of neck pain in dentists is 74.3%. Musculoskeletal symptoms in dentists are caused due to many reasons for e.g., prolonged static posture, repetitive movements, suboptimal lighting, and genetic predisposition. Since deep cervical muscle activity is required in synergy with superficial muscle activity to stabilize the cervical segments, a study is needed, to compare the effectiveness of deep cervical flexor (DCF) training and posture correction training on neck pain and neck disability index and forward head posture.\nAim: To determine and compare the effect of DCF training on forward head posture, neck pain and neck disability index in dentists suffering from chronic non severe neck pain.\nMaterial and methods: Total of 30 subjects were selected, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, who were further divided into Experimental and Control groups. Baseline information of dependent variables was taken at the beginning of study on day one, for Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Neck disability Index (NDI). Forward head posture was measured on day one using digital photograph technique. Then, Experimental group was given DCF training and Control group was given conventional isometrics training (CIT) for 4 weeks under supervision of examiner. All measurements were repeated at end of 4(th) week, on completion of study.\nResults: It was observed that pain and disability had reduced in both groups on group analysis. But the forward head posture had improved significantly in experimental group only.\nConclusion: DCF training is more effective than CIT in improving forward head posture, decreasing pain and disability in dentists suffering from chronic neck pain."

  "date": "2013 Jun",
  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this case report is to describe chiropractic management of a patient with arm and hand numbness and who was suspected to have ulnar nerve compression.\nClinical features: A 41-year-old woman presented with hand weakness and numbness along the medial aspect of her right forearm and the 3 most medial fingers. The onset of symptoms presented suddenly, 3 weeks prior, when she woke up in the morning and assumed she had \"slept wrong.\" The patient's posture showed protracted shoulders and moderate forward head carriage. Orthopedic assessment revealed symptomatic right elevated arm stress test, grip strength asymmetry, and a Tinel sign at the right cubital tunnel.\nIntervention and outcome: The patient was treated using chiropractic care, which consisted of manipulative therapy, myofascial therapy, and elastic therapeutic taping. Active home care included performing postural exercises and education about workstation ergonomics. She demonstrated immediate subjective improvement of her numbness and weakness after the first treatment. Over a series of 11 treatments, her symptoms resolved completely; and she was able to perform work tasks without dysfunction.\nConclusion: Chiropractic treatment consisting of manipulation, soft tissue mobilizations, exercise, and education of workstation ergonomics appeared to reduce the symptoms of ulnar nerve compression symptoms for this patient."

  "title": "A flexed posture in elderly patients is associated with impairments in postural control during walking",
  "date": "2014 Feb",
  "abstract": "A flexed posture (FP) is characterized by protrusion of the head and an increased thoracic kyphosis (TK), which may be caused by osteoporotic vertebral fractures (VFs). These impairments may affect motor function, and consequently increase the risk of falling and fractures. The aim of the current study was therefore to examine postural control during walking in elderly patients with FP, and to investigate the relationship with geriatric phenomena that may cause FP, such as increased TK, VFs, frailty, polypharmacy and cognitive impairments. Fifty-six elderly patients (aged 80 ± 5.2 years; 70% female) walked 160 m at self-selected speed while trunk accelerations were recorded. Walking speed, mean stride time and coefficient of variation (CV) of stride time were recorded. In addition, postural control during walking was quantified by time-dependent variability measures derived from the theory of stochastic dynamics, indicating smoothness, degree of predictability, and local stability of trunk acceleration patterns. Twenty-five patients (45%) had FP and demonstrated a more variable and less structured gait pattern, and a more irregular trunk acceleration pattern than patients with normal posture. FP was significantly associated with an increased TK, but not with other geriatric phenomena. An increased TK may bring the body's centre of mass forward, which requires correcting responses, and reduces the ability to respond on perturbation, which was reflected by higher variation in the gait pattern in FP-patients. Impairments in postural control during walking are a major risk factor for falling: the results indicate that patients with FP have impaired postural control during walking and might therefore be at increased risk of falling."

  "date": "2013 Jun",
  "abstract": "[Purpose] Assessment of posture is an important goal of physical therapy interventions for preventing the progression of forward head posture (FHP). The purpose of this study was to determine the inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of the assessment of FHP. [Subjects and Methods] We recruited 45 participants (20 male subjects, 25 female subjects) from a university student population. Two physical therapists assessed FHP using images of head extension. FHP is characterized by the measurement of angles and distances between anatomical landmarks. Forward shoulder angle of 54° or less was defined as FHP. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities were estimated using Kendall's Taub correlation coefficients. [Results] Intra-class correlation of intra-rater measurements indicated an excellent level of reliability (0.91), and intra-class correlation of inter-rater measurements showed a good level of reliability in the assessment of FHP (0.75). [Conclusion] Assessment of FHP is an important component of evaluation and affects the design of the treatment regimen. The assessment of FHP was reliably measured by two physical therapists. It could therefore become a useful method for assessing FHP in the clinical setting. Future studies will be needed to provide more detailed quantitative data for accurate assessment of posture."

  "abstract": "[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of neck retraction taping on forward head posture and the upper trapezius muscle of computer workers during computer work. [Subjects] Twelve males aged 20-30 years were recruited. [Methods] We measured forward head angle and upper trapezius muscle activity during computer work before and after NRT. [Results] The FHP angle significantly decreased during computer work performed with NRT compared to without NRT. The UT muscle activity was also significantly decreased during computer work performed with NRT compared to without NRT. [Conclusion] We think that the taping tension provided by NRT may have provided a mechanical effect that prevented FHP. NRT may also encourage a proper head posture in patients unfamiliar with the neck retraction posture."

  "abstract": "[Purpose] This study examined the effects of deep flexor muscle-strengthening exercise on the neck-shoulder posture, and the strength and endurance of the deep flexor muscles of high-school students. [Subjects] The subjects were 30 seventeen-year-old female high-school students who complained about bad posture and chronic neck-shoulder pain. They were randomly divided into an experimental group of 15 subjects, who performed a deep flexor muscle-strengthening exercise and a control group of 15 subjects, who performed a basic stretching exercise. [Methods] The experimental group of 15 subjects performed a deep flexor muscle-strengthening exercise consisting of low-load training of the cranio-cervical flexor muscle, and the control group of 15 subjects performed a basic stretching exercise consisting of seven motions. [Results] The experimental group showed statistically significant changes in head tilt angle, neck flexion angle, forward shoulder angle, and the result of the cranio-cervical flexion test after the training. In contrast, the control group showed no statistically significant changes in these measures following the training. When the results of the groups were compared, statistically significant differences were found for all items between the experimental group and the control group. [Conclusion] Strengthening cranio-cervical flexor muscles is important for the adjustment of neck posture, and maintaining their stability is required to improve neck-shoulder posture."

Background Manual therapy has been shown to reduce headache frequency in participants with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). To what extent specific elements of treatment contribute to the effectiveness of manual therapy in CTTH is unknown.\nMethods: One hundred eighty-two participants with CTTH participated in a prospective longitudinal study: 142 underwent manual therapy and 40 participants received usual care by their general practitioner. Regression analysis was performed according to the steps described by Baron and Kenny, and the proportion of mediated effect was estimated for 3 potential mediators: (1) cervical range of motion, (2) neck flexor endurance, and (3) forward head posture. Outcome was defined as a 50% or greater reduction in headache days.\nResults: Neck flexor endurance mediated 24.5% of the effect of manual therapy. Cervical range of motion and forward head posture showed no mediated effect.\nConclusions: Increased neck flexor endurance appears to be a working mechanism of manual therapy. This finding supports isometric training of neck flexors in participants with CTTH. Trial registered with Netherlands Trial Register (TR 1074)."

  "abstract": "Gaze distance and head flexion suppress postural sway in healthy subjects. However, the effects of these factors on stroke patients have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of gaze distance and downward gazing on postural sway in stroke patients. We examined 15 stroke patients and 14 elderly controls. Postural sway was measured in the subjects under the following 5 conditions: eyes fixed forward on a marker located 600 cm ahead (600-cm condition); eyes fixed forward on a marker located 150 cm ahead (150-cm condition); eyes fixed downward (downward condition); the subject facing straight ahead but with eyes closed (closed-forward condition); and the subject facing downward but with eyes closed (closed-downward condition). The root mean squares of the anteroposterior (A-P RMS) and the mediolateral (M-L RMS) directions were determined. The results showed that the short gaze distance decreased the M-L RMS in both the stroke patients and controls (p < 0.001, r = 0.66; p = 0.024, r = 0.43, respectively). In the control group, the downward condition increased the M-L RMS when compared with the 600-cm condition (p = 0.011, r = 0.48). The downward condition decreased the A-P and M-L RMS in the stroke patients when compared with the 600-cm condition (A-P RMS: p < 0.001; r = 0.66, M-L RMS: p = 0.001; r = 0.59). Our results showed that the short gaze distance decreased postural sway in both groups, and downward gazing decreased it only in the stroke group."

  "date": "2013",
  "abstract": "Twelve boys with an average age of 9.9 years were instructed to carry backpacks that weighed 0%, 10% and 15% of their body weights (BWs) to complete planned and unplanned gait termination experiments. The craniohorizontal, craniovertebral and sagittal shoulder posture angles at the sagittal plane as well as the anterior head alignment and coronal shoulder posture angles at the coronal plane were analysed. Results revealed significantly smaller craniohorizontal and sagittal shoulder posture angles during planned gait termination and a significantly smaller sagittal shoulder posture angle during unplanned gait termination under loaded conditions compared with those at 0% BW backpacks. Furthermore, the coronal shoulder posture angles at 10% and 15% BW during planned and unplanned gait terminations were significantly larger than those at 0% BW. Therefore, subjects were more likely to have a forward head posture, rounded shoulder posture and increased lateral tilting of the shoulders during gait termination as backpack loads were increased. However, gait termination, whether planned or unplanned, did not elicit a remarkable effect on posture."

  "date": "2014 Jan",
  "abstract": "Purpose: To propose a simple, forward-planned three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) technique for breast cancer patients with frozen shoulder.\nMaterials and methods: A technique is described that avoids lateral beams transmitting through the arm of the affected side. One medial, tangentially applied beam deposits most of the dose. Further beams with little weight are used to attain dose homogeneity. In order to quantify dose distribution and homogeneity in the planning target volume (PTV), as well as the scattered dose in organs at risk (OAR), the parameters D95, D5, D1, mean and median dose were determined for the individual volumes. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were created in order to compare these with the proposed technique.\nResults: The described technique achieved homogenous dose deposition within the PTV. A regimen comprising 25 fractions of 2 Gy prescribed to the PTV resulted in the following dose parameters: PTV(D95): 44.3 Gy, PTV(D5): 52.7 Gy, PTV(D1): 54.8 Gy, PTV(mean): 49.3 Gy and PTV(median): 49.9 Gy. Mean lung dose was 7.0 Gy. The ipsilateral lung received a mean dose of 9.9 Gy. This plan was accepted for treatment. The IMRT and VMAT plans achieved a similar dose distribution in the PTV. These techniques also reduced dose deposition in the OAR.\nConclusion: The proposed 3D-CRT technique allows treatment of breast cancer patients who are not able to raise their arms above their head. Homogenous dose distribution in the PTV was achieved while avoiding lateral beams that transmit through the arm of the affected side. Mean lung dose was comparable to that of the conventional technique using opposed tangential beams. IMRT and VMAT also provide good target dose homogeneity with good sparing of OAR. However, these techniques are more demanding in terms of planning and quality assurance."

  "title": "Evaluating the head posture of dentists with no neck pain",
  "date": "2013 Oct",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Dentistry is one of the professions that requires a high degree of concentration during the treatment of patients. There are many predisposing factors, affecting dentists when working on the patient's teeth, including neck flexion, arm abduction and inflexible postural positions, which may put them at the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders related to the neck. Although dentists with long records of service show different levels of pain and discomfort in their necks, there is no evidence regarding whether younger dentists report neck pain before the onset of an abnormal condition in this region, including forward head posture (FHP). Discovering any alteration in the head posture of dentists might confirm one of the reasons for neck pain in this population.\nMaterials: Forty one dentists with no neck pain and forty controls having jobs other than dentistry who had no risk factors related to head posture voluntarily participated in the present study. A standard method was used to measure the cervical curve in these two groups.\nResults: There was no significant difference between the mean values of cervical curve in dentists and the control group (p > 0.05). There was also no significant difference between cervical curve values in dentists working for either 5-8 years or 8-12 years (p > 0.05). The only significant difference was observed in mean cervical curve values of men and women in the dentist group (p < 0.05).\nConclusion: No alteration of cervical curve in the dentist group compared to controls might be due to absence of pain sensation in the dentists in the current study. In other words, this group might have not yet experienced sufficient change in head posture to experience significant pain in their neck region."

  "date": "2013 Nov 15",
  "abstract": "Rollover crashes are dynamic and complex events in which head impacts with the roof can cause catastrophic neck injuries. Ex vivo and computational models are valuable in understanding, and ultimately preventing, these injuries. Although neck posture and muscle activity influence the resulting injury, there is currently no in vivo data describing these parameters immediately prior to a head-first impact. The specific objectives of this study were to determine the in vivo neck vertebral alignment and muscle activation levels when upside down, a condition that occurs during a rollover. Eleven human subjects (6F, 5M) were tested while seated upright and inverted in a custom-built apparatus. Vertebral alignment was measured using fluoroscopy and muscle activity was recorded using surface and indwelling electrodes in eight superficial and deep neck muscles. In vivo vertebral alignment and muscle activation levels differed between the upright and inverted conditions. When inverted and relaxed, the neck was more lordotic, C1 was aligned posterior to C7, the Frankfort plane was extended, and the activity of six muscles increased compared to upright and relaxed. When inverted subjects were asked to look forward to eliminate head extension, flexor muscle activity increased, C7 was more flexed, and C1 was aligned anterior to C7 versus upright and relaxed. Combined with the large inter-subject variability observed, these findings indicate that cadaveric or computational models designed to study injuries and prevention devices while inverted need to consider a variety of postures and muscle conditions to be relevant to the in vivo situation."

Results The students with hearing loss had a higher occurrence of changes in the alignment of the head than normally hearing students (p < 0.001). Forward head posture was the type of postural change observed most, occurring in greater proportion in children with hearing loss (p < 0.001), followed by the side slope head posture (p < 0.001).

  "abstract": "Background: Chronic neck pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal pain conditions experienced by many people during their lives. Although patients with neck pain are managed predominantly as musculoskeletal patients, there are indications that they also have poor pulmonary function. The aim of this study was to examine whether patients with chronic neck pain have spirometric abnormalities and whether neck pain problems and psychological states are associated with these abnormalities.\nMethods: Forty-five participants with chronic neck pain and 45 well-matched healthy controls were recruited. Spirometry was used to assess participants' pulmonary function. Neck muscle strength, endurance of deep neck flexors, cervical range of motion, forward head posture, psychological states, disability, and pain intensity were also evaluated.\nResults: The results showed that patients with chronic neck pain yielded significantly reduced vital capacity, FVC, expiratory reserve volume, and maximum voluntary ventilation (P < .05), but peak expiratory flow, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC ratio were not affected (P > .05). Strength of neck muscles, pain intensity, and kinesiophobia were found to be significantly correlated (r > 0.3, P < .05) with respiratory function.\nConclusions: Patients with chronic neck pain do not have optimal pulmonary function. Cervical spine muscle dysfunction in parallel with pain intensity and kinesiophobia are factors that are associated mainly with this respiratory dysfunction."

  "abstract": "Background: The etiology of the neck and back discomfort are highly associated with abnormal static posture such as forward head posture and flexed relaxed posture; such postures are regarded as the risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Although, various ergonomic chairs and devices have been developed for computer workers, there are few reports of software that can alert users to their posture or work hours.\nObjective: Purpose of the present study was to investigate the difference of kinematics of the neck and trunk segments as well as muscular activation between condition with and without posture related auditory cueing.\nMethods: Twelve male computer workers were recruited in this study. A posture related auditory cueing (PAC) program used a media file that generated postural correction cue at intervals of 300 seconds. Surface electromyography was used to measure the activity of the erector spine and upper trapezius. Kinematic data were obtained using an ultrasonic three dimensional movement analysis system.\nResults: The results showed that the means of trunk flexion and forward head angle were significantly reduced with PAC. The muscular activity of the erector spine and upper trapezius was significantly higher with the PAC and significantly lower without the PAC.\nConclusions: Our findings suggested that the software providing PACs is an ergonomic device with positive effects for preventing habitual poor posture and potential for widespread practical usage."

The literature has identified ergonomic awareness to be grossly lacking among practicing surgeons, and video has not been documented as a teaching tool for this population. Taking this into account, we created a video that demonstrates proper positioning of monitors and equipment, and incorrect and correct ergonomic positions during surgery. Also presented are 3 common ergonomic errors in surgeon posture: forward head position, improper shoulder elevation, and pelvic girdle asymmetry. Postural reset and motion strategies are demonstrated to help the surgeon learn techniques to counterbalance the sustained and awkward positions common during surgery that lead to muscle fatigue, pain, and degenerative changes.\nConclusion: Correct ergonomics is a learned and practiced behavior. We believe that video is a useful way to facilitate improvement in ergonomic behaviors. We suggest that consideration of operating room setup, proper posture, and practice of postural resets are necessary components for a longer, healthier, and pain-free surgical career."

  "abstract": "Background: There are different methods to assess forward head posture (FHP) but the accuracy and discrimination ability of these methods are not clear.\nObjectives: Here, we want to compare three postural angles for FHP assessment and also study the discrimination accuracy of three photogrammetric methods to differentiate groups categorized based on observational method.\nMethod: All Seventy-eight healthy female participants (23 ± 2.63 years), were classified into three groups: moderate-severe FHP, slight FHP and non FHP based on observational postural assessment rules. Applying three photogrammetric methods - craniovertebral angle, head title angle and head position angle - to measure FHP objectively.\nResults: One - way ANOVA test showed a significant difference in three categorized group's craniovertebral angle (P< 0.05, F=83.07). There was no dramatic difference in head tilt angle and head position angle methods in three groups. According to Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) results, the canonical discriminant function (Wilks'Lambda) was 0.311 for craniovertebral angle with 79.5% of cross-validated grouped cases correctly classified.\nConclusion: Our results showed that, craniovertebral angle method may discriminate the females with moderate-severe and non FHP more accurate than head position angle and head tilt angle. The photogrammetric method had excellent inter and intra rater reliability to assess the head and cervical posture."

  "title": "Hypocapnia in patients with chronic neck pain: association with pain, muscle function, and psychologic states",
  "date": "2013 Sep",
  "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with chronic neck pain have changes in their transcutaneous partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PtcCO2) and whether other physical and psychologic parameters are associated.\nDesign: In this cross-sectional study, 45 patients with chronic idiopathic neck pain and 45 healthy sex-, age-, height-, and weight-matched controls were voluntarily recruited. The participants' neck muscle strength, endurance of the deep neck flexors, neck range of movement, forward head posture, psychologic states (anxiety, depression, kinesiophobia, and catastrophizing), disability, and pain were assessed. PtcCO2 was assessed using transcutaneous blood gas monitoring.\nResults: The patients with chronic neck pain presented significantly reduced PtcCO2 (P < 0.01). In the patients, PtcCO2 was significantly correlated with strength of the neck muscles, endurance of the deep neck flexors, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing, and pain intensity (P < 0.05). Pain intensity, endurance of the deep neck flexors, and kinesiophobia remained as significant predictors into the regression model of PtcCO2.\nConclusions: Patients with chronic neck pain present with reduced PtcCO2, which can reach the limits of hypocapnia. This disturbance seems to be associated with physical and psychologic manifestations of neck pain. These findings can have a great impact on various clinical aspects, notably, patient assessment, rehabilitation, and drug prescription."

  "title": "Persons with multiple disabilities increase adaptive responding and control inadequate posture or behavior through programs based on microswitch-cluster technology",
  "date": "2013 Oct",
  "abstract": "Study I used typical microswitch-cluster programs to promote adaptive responding (i.e., object manipulation) and reduce inappropriate head or head-trunk forward leaning with a boy and a woman with multiple disabilities. Optic, tilt, and vibration microswitches were used to record their adaptive responses while optic and tilt microswitches monitored their posture. The study included an ABB(1)AB(1) sequence, in which A represented baseline phases, B represented an intervention phase in which adaptive responses were always followed by preferred stimulation, and B(1) represented intervention phases in which the adaptive responses led to preferred stimulation only if the inappropriate posture was absent. Study II assessed a non-typical, new microswitch-cluster program to promote two adaptive responses (i.e., mouth cleaning to reduce drooling effects and object assembling) with a man with multiple disabilities. Initially, the man received preferred stimulation for each cleaning response. Then, he received stimulation only if mouth cleaning was preceded by object assembling. The results of Study I showed that both participants had large increases in adaptive responding and a drastic reduction in inappropriate posture during the B(1) phases and a 2-week post-intervention check. The results of Study II showed that the man learned to control drooling effects through mouth cleaning and used object assembling to extend constructive engagement and interspace cleaning responses functionally. The practical implications of the findings are discussed."

  "title": "Does posture of the cervical spine influence dorsal neck muscle activity when lifting?",
  "date": "2014 Feb",
  "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that postural orientations of the neck, such as flexed or forward head postures, are associated with heightened activity of the dorsal neck muscles. While these studies describe the impact of variations in neck posture alone, there is scant literature regarding the effect of neck posture on muscle activity when combined with upper limb activities such as lifting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of three different neck postures on the activity of the different layers of the dorsal neck muscles during a lifting task. Ultrasound measurements of dorsal neck muscle deformation were compared over two time points (rest, during lift) during a lifting task performed in three different neck postural conditions (neutral, flexed and forward head posture) in 21 healthy subjects. Data were analysed by post-process speckle tracking analysis. Results demonstrated significantly greater muscle deformation induced by flexed and forward head postures, compared to the neutral posture, for all dorsal neck muscles at rest (p<0.05). Significant condition by time interactions associated with the lift was observed for four out of the five dorsal muscles (p<0.02). These findings demonstrate that posture of the cervical spine influenced the level of muscle deformation not only at rest, but also when lifting. The findings of the study suggest that neck posture should be considered during the evaluation or design of lifting activities as it may contribute to excessive demands on dorsal neck muscles with potential detrimental consequences."

  "date": "2014 Jan",
  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate previous research to determine if exercise can improve preexisting hyperkyphosis by decreasing the angle of thoracic kyphosis in adults aged ≥45 years.\nData sources: PubMed, Embase, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases were searched for studies related to posture, exercise, and age ≥45 years. Online conference proceedings of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, American Physical Therapy Association, and Gerontological Society of America were also searched.\nStudy selection: Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts and selected studies that tested the effect of exercise on measures of kyphosis, or forward head posture, in individuals with hyperkyphosis at baseline (defined as angle of kyphosis ≥40°). Reviews, letters, notes, and non-English language studies were excluded.\nData extraction: A pilot-tested abstraction form was used by each reviewer to extract data from each study regarding details of exercise intervention, participant characteristics, safety, adherence, and results. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess methodologic quality. Discrepancies on the abstraction forms between the 2 reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer. A formal meta-analysis was not performed.\nData synthesis: Thirteen studies were abstracted and included in the review; of these, 8 studies saw improvements in ≥1 measure of posture. The main sources of bias were related to blinding participants and incomplete outcome data. The adherence reported across studies suggests that exercise is an acceptable intervention for individuals with age-related hyperkyphosis.\nConclusions: The scarcity and quality of available data did not permit a pooled estimate of the effect of exercise on hyperkyphotic posture; however, the positive effects observed in high-quality studies suggest some benefit and support the need for an adequately designed randomized controlled trial examining the effect of exercise on hyperkyphosis."

  "date": "2013 Jun",
  "abstract": "Objective: To review studies regarding effects of high-heeled shoes on body posture of adolescents.\nData sources: The research was conducted in the Scopus, SciELO and PubMed databases between 1980 and 2011, searching for articles written in English and Portuguese with the following key-words: \"posture\", \"center of gravity\", and \"high-heeled shoes\". Among 55 retrieved articles, 20 were analyzed regarding posture of the spine and lower limbs, the center of gravity, and the effects of high-heeled shoes in the musculoskeletal system in adolescents.\nData synthesis: Frequent use of high-heeled shoes leads to modification of the gravity center and body balance, which can lead to changes in the alignment of body segments. This has a negative impact on motor development of adolescents. In this phase, it is necessary to keep the posture in order to maintain the physiological growth and development of the musculoskeletal system.\nConclusions: High-heeled shoes in adolescents can lead to the development of postural disorders, among which stands out the forward head posture, lumbar hyperlordosis, pelvic anteversion, and knee valgus. The height and width of the heels are characteristics that exert most influence in the emergence of postural changes and body imbalance."

  "abstract": "Introduction: Individuals with tension-type headache (TTH), in addition to headache pain, typically suffer from pericranial muscle tenderness and increased cervical muscle tone. Physical and physiological outcomes related to musculoskeletal function, however, are not commonly assessed in clinical studies and not systematically proposed as outcome measures in headache-related practice guidelines.\nObjectives: To review which musculoskeletal outcomes are used in the clinical assessment of patients with TTH and which are associated with headache pain and related dysfunction.\nMethods: Literature searches were performed in MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane databases and EMBASE using terms relating to musculoskeletal physical outcomes in TTH.\nResults: Twenty-six studies met selection criteria. Physiological outcomes typically reported in laboratory studies were trigger points, pressure pain threshold, range of motion and tenderness. A greater number of trigger points and lower pressure pain threshold were reported in patients with episodic TTH in comparison with healthy subjects. Individuals with chronic TTH, when compared with non-headache controls, consistently showed a greater number of trigger points, a lower value of pressure pain threshold and a more severe forward head posture.\nConclusion: Musculoskeletal outcomes, such as trigger points, pressure pain threshold and forward head posture should inform TTH pathophysiology, diagnosis and interdisciplinary patient care."

  "date": "2013 Oct",
  "abstract": "Physical and psychosocial stressors in the workplace have been independently associated with the development of neck pain, yet interactions among these risk factors remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of mentally challenging computer work performed with and without exposure to a psychosocial stressor on cervical muscle activity and posture. Changes in cervical posture and electromyography of upper trapezius, cervical extensor, and sternocleidomastoid muscles were compared between a resting seated posture at baseline, a low stress condition with mental concentration, and a high stress condition with mental concentration and psychosocial stress in sixty healthy office workers. Forward head posture significantly increased with mental concentration compared to baseline, but did not change with further introduction of the stressor. Muscle activity significantly increased from the low stress to high stress condition for both the dominant and non-dominant upper trapezius, with no corresponding change in activity of the cervical extensors or flexors between stress conditions. These findings suggest that upper trapezius muscles are selectively activated by psychosocial stress independent of changes in concentration or posture, which may have implications for the prevention of stress-related trapezius myalgia in the workplace."

  "abstract": "A biomechanical study of the head-neck complex in seated subjects was conducted to verify whether a slight load, applied at the back of the head, could beneficially affect the head-neck posture, one of the factors of postural neck pain. An eccentric load of 0.5 kg was applied to the subjects' head by means of a special cap. A group of asymptomatic subjects (n=10, 28.9±12.1 yrs), and a group of subjects that had experienced mild, occasional neck pain (n=10, 39.6±18.4 yrs) were compared. They were analyzed while maintaining a still posture that was periodically perturbed to avoid habituation. A 3D motion analyzer and reflective markers placed over the head, the neck and the trunk, were used to compute head inclination and translation and head/neck flexion angle in different conditions: before, during and after having had the load applied for 15 min. Although the moment induced by the load was extensor, a forward-oriented movement of the head was observed in both groups. However, the forward displacement, in relation to the initial position, was smaller in the mild neck pain group than in the asymptomatic group (5.7±4.7 mm vs. 8.9±5.5 mm, P<0.05 and 2.6±5.9 mm vs. 11.0±9.0 mm after 15 min, P<0.05). After removing the load, the mild neck pain subjects assumed a retracted position (-3.8±2.7 mm) while the asymptomatic subjects stayed protracted (+3.5±5.1 mm, P<0.01). These unexpected findings suggest that a slight load added to the head can influence the postural control mechanisms and, in symptomatic subjects, lead to a new strategy aimed at a reduction of the neck extensor muscle contraction."

  "abstract": "Context: Overhead athletes commonly have poor posture. Commercial braces are used to improve posture and function, but few researchers have examined the effects of shoulder or scapular bracing on posture and scapular muscle activity.\nObjective: To examine whether a scapular stabilization brace acutely alters posture and scapular muscle activity in healthy overhead athletes with forward-head, rounded-shoulder posture (FHRSP).\nDesign: Randomized controlled clinical trial.\nSetting: Applied biomechanics laboratory.\nPatients or other participants: Thirty-eight healthy overhead athletes with FHRSP.\nIntervention(s): Participants were assigned randomly to 2 groups: compression shirt with no strap tension (S) and compression shirt with the straps fully tensioned (S + T). Posture was measured using lateral-view photography with retroreflective markers. Electromyography (EMG) of the upper trapezius (UT), middle trapezius (MT), lower trapezius (LT), and serratus anterior (SA) in the dominant upper extremity was measured during 4 exercises (scapular punches, W's, Y's, T's) and 2 glenohumeral motions (forward flexion, shoulder extension). Posture and exercise EMG measurements were taken with and without the brace applied.\nMain outcome measure(s): Head and shoulder angles were measured from lateral-view digital photographs. Normalized surface EMG was used to assess mean muscle activation of the UT, MT, LT, and SA.\nResults: Application of the brace decreased forward shoulder angle in the S + T condition. Brace application also caused a small increase in LT EMG during forward flexion and Y's and a small decrease in UT and MT EMG during shoulder extension. Brace application in the S + T group decreased UT EMG during W's, whereas UT EMG increased during W's in the S group.\nConclusions: Application of the scapular brace improved shoulder posture and scapular muscle activity, but EMG changes were highly variable. Use of a scapular brace might improve shoulder posture and muscle activity in overhead athletes with poor posture."

  "title": "In search of the pitching momentum that enables some lizards to sustain bipedal running at constant speeds",
  "date": "2013 May 8",
  "abstract": "The forelimbs of lizards are often lifted from the ground when they start sprinting. Previous research pointed out that this is a consequence of the propulsive forces from the hindlimbs. However, despite forward acceleration being hypothesized as necessary to lift the head, trunk and forelimbs, some species of agamids, teiids and basilisks sustain running in a bipedal posture at a constant speed for a relatively long time. Biomechanical modelling of steady bipedal running in the agamid Ctenophorus cristatus now shows that a combination of three mechanisms must be present to generate the angular impulse needed to cancel or oppose the effect of gravity. First, the trunk must be lifted significantly to displace the centre of mass more towards the hip joint. Second, the nose-up pitching moment resulting from aerodynamic forces exerted at the lizard's surface must be taken into account. Third, the vertical ground-reaction forces at the hindlimb must show a certain degree of temporal asymmetry with higher forces closer to the instant of initial foot contact. Such asymmetrical vertical ground-reaction force profiles, which differ from the classical spring-mass model of bipedal running, seem inherent to the windmilling, splayed-legged running style of lizards."

  "abstract": "Objective: The facial esthetics after orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery may be affected by the patient's natural head position. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the natural head position for the three skeletal classes of malocclusion.\nMaterials and methods: Our sample consisted of 102 lateral cephalometric radiographs of patients aged 15 to 18 years; class I (n=32), class II (n=40) and class III (n=30). Nine landmarks of the craniofacial skeleton and three landmarks of the cervical vertebrae were determined. Variables consisted of two angles for cervical posture (OPT/Hor and CVT/Hor), three angles for craniofacial posture (SN/Ver, PNS-ANS/Ver, and ML/Ver ) and five for craniofacial angulation (SN/OPT, SN/CVT, PNS-ANS/OPT, PNS-ANS/CVT, ML/CVT). The data were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and post hoc tests.\nResults: PNS-ANS/Ver and SN/Ver differed significantly (p<0.05) among the three groups. There were no significant differences between class I and class II malocclusions for the indicator angles of cranial posture except for ML/Ver. The SN/CVT was significantly different for class I compared to class III patients. A head posture camouflaging the underlying skeletal class III was observed in our population.\nConclusion: A more forward head posture was observed in skeletal class III participants compared to skeletal class I and II and that class III patients tended to incline their head more ventral compared to class I participants. These findings may have implications for the amount of jaw movements during surgery particularly in patients with a class III malocclusion."

  "title": "Muscle contributions to center of mass acceleration adapt to asymmetric walking in healthy subjects",
  "date": "2013 Sep",
  "abstract": "Symmetrical limb movement requires complex muscle coordination patterns. Consequently, coordination impairments lead to asymmetric gait patterns, as often seen in stroke subjects. Split-belt walking has previously been used to induce limping-like walking in able-bodied adults. The goal of this study is to analyze how muscle coordination patterns that control the centre of mass are modulated during an asymmetric gait pattern imposed on healthy subjects. These modulations can be uniquely related to the biomechanics of limping as no pathology is present. Forward simulations of limping-like walking (split-belt) and corresponding symmetric conditions (tied-belt) were generated for twelve healthy subjects. Our results show that the differences between 'fast' and 'slow' leg contributions during split-belt walking are not attributable to simple differences in speed between the belts, because most split-belt muscle contributions differ from tied-belt walking. Different types of modulations, inducing increased, decreased or even reversed asymmetry (e.g. plantarflexors, biceps femoris short head, and quadriceps respectively), underlie limping-like walking in healthy subjects. In general, these patterns present large similarities with adaptations previously described in hemiplegic subjects. However, differences were found with gluteus medius and biceps femoris short head contributions in hemiplegic subjects, suggesting that the latter are not just related to limping, but to concomitant deficits."

  "date": "2013 Jun",
  "abstract": "Effective regulation of pace enables the majority of runners to complete competitive endurance events without mishap. However, some runners do experience exercise-induced collapse associated with postural hypotension, which in rare cases results from life-threatening conditions such as cardiac disorders, cerebral events, heat stroke and hyponatraemia. Despite the experience of either catastrophic system failure or extreme peripheral muscle fatigue, some runners persist in attempting to reach the finish line, and this often results in a sequence of dynamic changes in posture and gait that we have termed the 'Foster collapse positions'. The initial stage involves an unstable gait and the runner assumes the 'Early Foster' collapse position with hips slightly flexed and their head lowered. This unstable gait further degrades into a shuffle referred to as the 'Half Foster' collapse position characterized by hip flexion of approximately 90° with the trunk and head parallel to the ground. At this point, the muscles of postural support and the co-ordination of propulsion begin to be compromised. If the condition worsens, the runner will fall to the ground and assume the 'Full Foster' collapse position, which involves crawling forwards on knees and elbows towards the finish line, with their trunk angled such that the head is at a lower angle than the hips. Upon reaching the finish line, or sometimes before that, the runner may collapse and remain prone until recovering either with or without assistance or medical treatment. The Foster collapse positions are indicative of a final, likely primordial, protective mechanism designed to attenuate postural hypotension, cardiac 'pump' insufficiency or cerebral blood flow deficiency. Continuing to attempt to reach the finish line in this impaired state is also perhaps indicative of a high psychological drive or a variety of neurological and psychological pathologies such as diminished sensitivity to interoceptive feedback, unrealistic situational appraisal or extreme motivational drives. A better understanding of the physiological, neurological and psychological antecedents of the Foster collapse sequence remains an important issue with practical implications for runner safety and theoretical understanding of collapses during exercise."

Seven consecutive patients who had had only BSSO advancement, and had had preoperative and 6-week postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CT) scans, were recruited to this retrospective study. Two variables, SNB and SNC2, were used to indicate the craniomandibular alignment and craniocervical inclination, respectively, in the midsagittal plane. Using 3-dimensional cephalometric analysis software, the SNB and the SNC2 were recorded in volume and measured in the midsagittal plane at 3 independent time-points. The reliability was measured and a paired t test used to assess the significance of differences between the means of SNB and SNC2 before and after operation. The 3-dimensional cephalometric measurement showed good reliability. The SNB was increased as planned in all the mandibles that were advanced, the cervical vertebrae were brought forward after BSSO, and the SNC2 was significantly increased in 6 of the 7 patients. Three-dimensional cephalometric analysis may provide an alternative way of assessing cephalometrics. After BSSO advancement, the natural position of the head changed by increasing the craniocervical inclination in an anteroposterior direction."

  "abstract": "A high percentage of children with cerebral palsy (CP) have difficulty keeping up with the handwriting demands at school. Previous studies have addressed the effects of proper sitting and writing tool on writing performance, but less on body biomechanics. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of lower body stabilization and pencil design on body biomechanics in children with CP. Fourteen children (12.31±4.13 years old) with CP were recruited for this study. A crossover repeated measures design was employed, with two independent variables: lower body stabilization (with/without) and pencil (regular/assigned grip height/biaxial). The writing task was to trace the Archimedean spiral mazes. Electromyography (EMG) of the upper extremity, the wrist flexion/extension movements, and the whole body photography were recorded to quantify the changes in posture and upper extremity biomechanics. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. No significant main effects were revealed in the EMG and wrist kinematics. The lower body stabilization significantly decreased the trunk lateral and forward deviations, and the visual focus-vertical angle. The biaxial pencil and the assigned grip height design significantly decreased the head, shoulder, trunk, and pelvic deviations compared with the regular design. The results indicated that the lower body positioning was effective in improving the trunk posture. A pencil with an assigned grip height or with a biaxial design could improve head, shoulder, trunk and pelvic alignment, but did not influence the muscle exertion of the upper extremity. This study could provide guidelines for parents, teachers and clinicians regarding the selection of writing tools and the knowledge of proper positioning for the children with handwriting difficulties. Further analyses can focus on the design, modification and clinical application of assitive sitting and writing devices for the use in children with handwriting difficulties."

The anatomical relationships between the lingual artery and the lingual markers were analyzed with the tongue in resting and extended positions using the CTA images.\nResults: The course of the lingual artery resembled the configuration of the Big Dipper constellation when the tongue was in a resting position. When the tongue was in a full-extended position, the majority of the lingual artery moved forward and upward with the hyoid and formed a \"√\" fashion. The positions of the tip of the greater horn of the hyoid changed with the tongue positions. While the relationship between the main lingual artery and the tip of the greater horn of the hyoid, as well as the distances between bilateral lingual arteries, remained constant in both tongue positions.\nConclusions: In conditions of dynamic tongue movement, the tip of the great horn of the hyoid and the lingual midline are constant anatomical markers to indicate the course of the lingual artery."

  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and propose improvements to the injury mitigation systems, in near-side impacts, for 6 common sitting positions of young adolescents using a previously validated model.\nMethods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car, including head and thorax-pelvis air bags, which was impacted laterally by a barrier in 2 load cases. The SID-IIs finite element model was used for the evaluations and was seated in 6 different positions in the rear outboard seat: the nominal anthropomorphic test device (ATD) position, 1 inboard position, 3 outboard positions, and 1 braking (forward) position. These positions have previously been identified as common sitting positions in awake and asleep children. The studied dependent variables were head injury criterion (HIC) 36, resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest viscous criterion, and chest deflection.\nResults: The lowest head injury measures were seen in the braking positions and in the nominal ATD position, and the highest were seen in the inboard and outboard positions. The lowest chest injury measures were recorded in the inboard and nominal ATD positions, and the highest were recorded in the outboard and braking positions. The occupant in the outboard positions interfered with the air bags during their deployment. The occupant in inboard and braking positions tended to push the curtain air bag over the windowsill.\nConclusions: Studies that investigate the injury mitigation effects in common sitting positions, beyond the nominal ATD position, are essential to highlight means to provide improved and robust safety for child occupants. This study was based on the SID-IIs 5th percentile female, which has very similar anthropometry to a 50th percentile 12-year-old. Therefore, the conclusions of this study are applicable to many 11-year-olds up to young adolescents, as well as to small females. The outboard and inboard positions of this study resulted in the highest head injury measures. Although all of the injury measures were only slightly higher than the nominal position, the trends suggest that, in near-side impacts, these positions should be discouraged. The extensively outboard positions resulted in unfavorable air bag positioning during deployment. The inboard position resulted in head strikes further forward of the nominal one; the curtain air bags need inflated cells at all locations of head strike."

To this end, 11 healthy children from 7 to 10years (latest stage of childhood) and 12 healthy adults participated in the experiment. The STS and BTS tasks were performed with horizontal support surface and support surface tilted 10° to the right or forward in order to investigate the immediate adaptation of the internal representations of the movement. Movement variables that included the durations of STS and BTS and the amplitudes of the trunk movement were computed. Postural characteristics were also considered during the transition from STS to BTS, including the trunk orientation and the head stabilization strategies. Despite certain similarities with adults, especially in terms of the asymmetry of the performance times for the two tasks (STS vs. BTS) and the partial movement adaptations, the children were less able than adults to adapt both postural and movement controls to the new support conditions. Thus, it appears that the updating of internal models of action is a process that matures slowly throughout ontogenesis."

  "date": "2013",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The objective of this study was to present, compare, and discuss the kinematic response of children and child anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) during emergency braking events in different restraint configurations in a passenger vehicle.\nMethods: A driving study was conducted on a closed-circuit test track comprising 16 children aged 4 to 12 years old and the Q3, Hybrid III (HIII) 3-year-old, 6-year-old, and 10-year-old ATDs restrained on the right rear seat of a modern passenger vehicle. The children were exposed to one braking event in each of the 2 restraint systems and the ATDs were exposed to 2 braking events in each restraint system. All events had a deceleration of 1.0 g. Short children (stature 107-123 cm) and the Q3, HIII 3-year-old, and 6-year-old were restrained on booster cushions as well as high-back booster seats. Tall children (stature 135-150 cm) and HIII 10-year-old were restrained on booster cushions or restrained by 3-point belts directly on the car seat. Vehicle data were collected and synchronized with video data. Forward trajectories for the forehead and external auditory canal (ear) were determined as well as head rotation and shoulder belt force.\nResults: A total of 40 trials were analyzed. Child volunteers had greater maximum forward displacement of the head and greater head rotation compared to the ATDs. The average maximum displacement for children ranged from 165 to 210 mm and 155 to 195 mm for the forehead and ear target, respectively. Corresponding values for the ATDs were 55 to 165 mm and 50 to 160 mm. The change in head angle was greater for short children than for tall children. Shoulder belt force was within the same range for short children when restrained on booster cushions or high-back booster seats. For tall children, the shoulder belt force was greater when restrained on booster cushions compared to being restrained by seat belts directly on the car seat.\nConclusions: The forward displacement was within the same range for all children regardless of stature and restraint system. However, the maximum forward position depended on the initial seated posture and shoulder belt position on the shoulder. Differences could also be seen in the curvature of the neck and spine. Short children exhibited a greater flexion motion of the head, whereas a more upright posture at maximum forward position was exhibited by the tall children. The ATDs displayed less forward displacement compared to the children."

  "title": "Does forward head posture affect postural control in human healthy volunteers?",
  "date": "2013 Jun",
  "abstract": "Proprioceptive afferent input from neck muscles plays an important role in postural control. Forward head posture has the potential to impair proprioceptive information from neck muscles and contribute to postural control deficits in patients with neck pain. This study investigated whether induced forward head posture affects postural control in healthy participants when compared to natural head posture. Centre of pressure sway area, distance covered and mean velocity were measured during 30s of static standing using a force platform with 25 healthy individuals (mean age ± SD = 20.76 ± 2.19 years) in 8 different conditions. Base of support, eyes open or closed and natural or forward head posture varied within these testing conditions. The majority of comparisons between natural and forward head posture were not statistically significant (p>0.05). This suggests that induced forward head posture in young healthy adults does not challenge them enough to impair postural control. Future studies should evaluate whether forward head posture affects postural control of individuals with chronic neck pain."

  "date": "2013 Jan",
  "abstract": "Background: Depending on the level and severity of the sensorimotor impairment in individuals with a spinal cord injury, the subsequent reduced seated postural stability and strength generating-capacity at the upper limbs could affect performance during sitting pivot transfer. This study aimed to determine the effects of sensorimotor impairments on head, trunk and upper limb movement and efforts during sitting pivot transfers.\nMethods: Twenty-six individuals with a spinal cord injury participated and were stratified in two subgroups: with (N=15) and without voluntary motor control (N=11) of their lower back and abdominal muscles. Kinematics and kinetics of sitting pivot transfer were collected using a transfer assessment system. Mean joint angles and movement amplitudes and peak and average joint moments were compared between subgroups using independent Student t-tests (P<0.05) for the weight-bearing sitting pivot transfer phases.\nFindings: The subgroup without voluntary control of their lower back and abdominal muscles had significantly greater forward trunk flexion compared to the other subgroup resulting in higher wrist extension and elbow flexion at both upper limbs. No significant joint moment difference was found between the subgroups.\nInterpretation: Individuals with spinal cord injury who have no voluntary motor control of their abdominal and lower back muscles increase forward trunk flexion during sitting pivot transfers 1) to increase stiffness of their spine that may optimize the strength-generating ability of their thoracohumeral muscles and 2) to lower their center of mass that may facilitate lift-off and enhance the overall stability during sitting pivot transfers."

  "abstract": "Respiratory muscle strength is one parameter that is currently proposed to be affected in patients with chronic neck pain. This study was aimed at examining whether patients with chronic neck pain have reduced respiratory strength and with which neck pain problems their respiratory strength is associated. In this controlled cross-sectional study, 45 patients with chronic neck pain and 45 healthy well-matched controls were recruited. Respiratory muscle strength was assessed through maximal mouth pressures. The subjects were additionally assessed for their pain intensity and disability, neck muscle strength, endurance of deep neck flexors, neck range of movement, forward head posture and psychological states. Paired t-tests showed that patients with chronic neck pain have reduced Maximal Inspiratory (MIP) (r = 0.35) and Maximal Expiratory Pressures (MEP) (r = 0.39) (P < 0.05). Neck muscle strength (r > 0.5), kinesiophobia (r < -0.3) and catastrophizing (r < -0.3) were significantly associated with maximal mouth pressures (P < 0.05), whereas MEP was additionally negatively correlated with neck pain and disability (r < -0.3, P < 0.05). Neck muscle strength was the only predictor that remained as significant into the prediction models of MIP and MEP. It can be concluded that patients with chronic neck pain present weakness of their respiratory muscles. This weakness seems to be a result of the impaired global and local muscle system of neck pain patients, and psychological states also appear to have an additional contribution. Clinicians are advised to consider the respiratory system of patients with chronic neck pain during their usual assessment and appropriately address their treatment."

  "date": "2012",
  "abstract": "The internal representation of the body is intimately related to postural orientation. This assists us to correctly identify our position relative to the earth-vertical. The postural orientation about the pitch-Y axis is by default forward tilted while there is no such default about the roll-X axis. We hypothetized that the internal representation of body position would be different between the Y and X axes. We designed a study to assess the accuracy of self-driven whole-body orienting to the horizontal and the vertical about the X (roll) and Y (pitch) axes, with healthy seated subjects in complete darkness. Consistent with our hypothesis, the results showed that when trying to reach the horizontal with the X-axis, subjects remained on the same tilted direction as the initial posture. On the return way to the vertical, the subjects did not cross this (vertical) line. Whereas when reaching the horizontal with the Y-axis, there was an undershoot on the supine direction, and an overshoot on the prone direction: this discrepancy could be due to somatosensory cues to subjects in seated posture. The relevant mechanisms related to the internal representation of the body and graviceptive systems underlying the construction of an head-foot line are discussed."

  "abstract": "Context: Head-first sports-induced impacts cause cervical fractures and dislocations and spinal cord lesions. In previous biomechanical studies, researchers have vertically dropped human cadavers, head-neck specimens, or surrogate models in inverted postures.\nObjective: To develop a cadaveric neck model to simulate horizontally aligned, head-first impacts with a straightened neck and to use the model to investigate biomechanical responses and failure mechanisms.\nDesign: Descriptive laboratory study.\nSetting: Biomechanics research laboratory.\nPatients or other participants: Five human cadaveric cervical spine specimens.\nIntervention(s): The model consisted of the neck specimen mounted horizontally to a torso-equivalent mass on a sled and carrying a surrogate head. Head-first impacts were simulated at 4.1 m/s into a padded, deformable barrier.\nMain outcome measure(s): Time-history responses were determined for head and neck loads, accelerations, and motions. Average occurrence times of the compression force peaks at the impact barrier, occipital condyles, and neck were compared.\nResults: The first local compression force peaks at the impact barrier (3070.0 ± 168.0 N at 18.8 milliseconds), occipital condyles (2868.1 ± 732.4 N at 19.6 milliseconds), and neck (2884.6 ± 910.7 N at 25.0 milliseconds) occurred earlier than all global compression peaks, which reached 7531.6 N in the neck at 46.6 milliseconds (P < .001). Average peak head motions relative to the torso were 6.0 cm in compression, 2.4 cm in posterior shear, and 6.4° in flexion. Neck compression fractures included occipital condyle, atlas, odontoid, and subaxial comminuted burst and facet fractures.\nConclusions: Neck injuries due to excessive axial compression occurred within 20 milliseconds of impact and were caused by abrupt deceleration of the head and continued forward torso momentum before simultaneous rebound of the head and torso. Improved understanding of neck injury mechanisms during sports-induced impacts will increase clinical awareness and immediate care and ultimately lead to improved protective equipment, reducing the frequency and severity of neck injuries and their associated societal costs."

  "date": "2012 Nov",
  "abstract": "While fatalities of car occupants in the EU decreased remarkably over the last decade, Powered Two Wheelers (PTWs) fatalities still increase following the increase of PTW ownership. Autonomous braking systems have been implemented in several types of vehicles and are presently addressed by research in the field of PTWs. A major concern in this context is the rider stability. Experiments with volunteers were performed in order to find out whether autonomous braking for PTWs will produce a greater instability of the rider in comparison to manual braking. The PTW's braking conditions were simulated in a laboratory with a motorcycle mock-up mounted on a sled, which was accelerated with an average of 0.35 g. The motion of the rider was captured in autonomous braking scenarios with and without pre-warning as well as in manual braking scenarios. No significant differences between the scenarios were found with respect to maximum forward displacement of the volunteer's torso and head (p<0.05). By performing clustering analysis on two kinematic parameters, two different strategies of the volunteers were identified. They were not related to the braking scenarios. A relation of the clusters with the initial posture represented by the elbow angle was revealed (p<0.05). It is concluded that autonomous braking at low deceleration will not cause significant instabilities of the rider in comparison to manual braking in idealized laboratory conditions. Based on this, further research into the development and implementation of autonomous braking systems for PTWs, e.g. by extensive riding tests, seems valuable."

  "date": "2012 Jan 1",
  "abstract": "Sensory conflict theories predict that adding simulated viewpoint oscillation to self-motion displays should generate significant and sustained visual-vestibular conflict and reduce the likelihood of illusory self-motion (vection). However, research shows that viewpoint oscillation enhances vection in upright observers. This study examined whether the oscillation advantage for vection depends on head orientation with respect to gravity. Displays that simulated forward/backward self-motion with/without horizontal and vertical viewpoint oscillation were presented to observers in upright (seated and standing) and lying (supine, prone, and left side down) body postures. Viewpoint oscillation was found to enhance vection for all of the body postures tested. Vection also tended to be stronger in upright postures than in lying postures. Changing the orientation of the head with respect to gravity was expected to alter the degree/saliency of the sensory conflict, which may explain the overall posture-based differences in vection strength. However, this does not explain why the oscillation advantage for vection persisted for all postures. Thus, the current postural and oscillation based vection findings appear to be better explained by ecology: Upright postures and oscillating flow (that are the norm during self-motion) improved vection, whereas lying postures and smooth optic flows (which are less common) impaired vection."

  "date": "2013 Jan-Feb",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Minor conductive hearing loss (CHL) can compromise the evaluation of the inner ear function with distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Elevation of the intracranial pressure (ICP) is also expected to alter the middle ear (ME) sound transmission. An impaired ME sound transmission leads to an attenuation of the DPOAE primary tone levels (L1 and L2) during forward transmission and of DPOAE levels (LDP) during backward transmission. The effect of the attenuation of L1 and L2 is complex and might have unexpected effects on DPOAE levels. In this work, CHL- and ICP-induced alterations of LDP versus L1 growth functions (constant L2 and increasing L1) are investigated. The first aim of this study is to explain how alterations of ME sound transmission can affect DPOAEs and to characterize the dependency of DPOAE level alterations on L2,L1 combinations and on the individual shape of LDP versus L1 growth functions. The second aim is to identify analogies between CHL- and ICP-induced alterations of DPOAEs and to discuss implications for a potential noninvasive ICP monitoring.\nDesign: This study focuses on general theoretical considerations, supported by selected experimental observations in different species and simulations. DPOAEs were measured in guinea pigs before and after induction of a CHL (1 ear) and during increased ICP (1 ear), and in humans during changes of the postural position to alter the ICP (4 ears).\nResults: In both CHL and elevated ICP, DPOAE levels are not only reduced, but LDP versus L1 growth functions exhibit a shift to higher L1. The absolute DPOAE level alterations strongly depend on the L2,L1 combinations and the individual shape of the LDP versus L1 growth functions. In steeper LDP versus L1 growth functions, the DPOAE level alterations exhibit a larger variation. DPOAE levels can even increase. The largest variation can be found in ears with a nonmonotonic DPOAE growth behavior. An example of a guinea pig ear is presented with a nonmonotonic DPOAE growth behavior and a CHL of 4 dB, where the DPOAE level alterations varied between -32 and +9 dB depending on L1.\nConclusions: The data enable a more comprehensive view of DPOAE level alterations during CHL and elevated ICP. The observations also explain the problem that DPOAE and ICP alterations do not correlate linearly. An evaluation of the shift of the LDP versus L1 growth function along the L1 axis provides a potential tool to improve both the assessment of the inner ear function in the presence of a CHL and noninvasive ICP monitoring with DPOAEs."

  "date": "2013 Feb",
  "abstract": "It is unclear how age-related postural changes such as thoracic spine kyphosis influence cervical range-of-motion (ROM) in patients with cervical spine dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to explore the mediating effects of forward head posture (FHP) on the relationship between thoracic kyphosis and cervical mobility in older adults with cervical spine dysfunction. Fifty-one older adults (30 females, mean[SD]age = 66[4.9] years) with cervical spine dysfunction - that is, cervical pain with or without referred pain, numbness or paraesthesia - participated. Pain-related disability was measured using the neck disability index (NDI). Thoracic kyphosis was measured using a flexicurve. FHP was assessed via the craniovertebral angle (CVA) measured from a digitized, lateral-view photograph of each subject. Cervical ROM - namely, upper and general cervical rotation and cervical flexion - was measured by the Cervical Range-of-Motion (CROM) device. Greater thoracic kyphosis was significantly associated with lesser CVA (Spearman ρ = -0.48) whereas greater CVA was significantly associated with greater cervical flexion (Spearman ρ = 0.30) and general rotation ROM (ρ = 0.33), but not with upper cervical rotation ROM (ρ = 0.15). Bootstrap mediational analyses, adjusted for age, gender, weight and NDI, revealed significant indirect effects of thoracic kyphosis on cervical flexion and general rotation ROM through a FHP. Our results show that FHP mediated the relationship between thoracic kyphosis and cervical ROM, specifically general cervical rotation and flexion. These results not only support the justifiable attention given to addressing FHP to improve cervical impairments, but they also suggest that addressing thoracic kyphosis impairments may constitute an \"upstream\" approach."

  "abstract": "Background: To determine the influence of breathing maneuver and sitting posture on tidal volume (TV), respiratory rate (RR), and muscle activity of the inspiratory accessory muscles in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nMethods: Twelve men with COPD participated in the study. Inductive respiratory plethysmography and surface electromyography were used to simultaneously measure TV, RR, and muscle activity of the inspiratory accessory muscles [the scalenus (SM), sternocleidomastoid (SCM), and pectoralis major (PM) muscles] during quiet natural breathing (QB) and pursed-lips breathing (PLB) in three sitting postures: neutral position (NP), with armm support (WAS), and with arm and head support (WAHS).\nResults: Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was employed. In a comparison of breathing patterns, PLB significantly increased TV and decreased RR compared to QB. Muscle activity in the SM and SCM increased significantly in PLB compared to QB. In a comparison of sitting postures, the muscle activity of the SM, SCM, and PM increased in the forward-leaning position.\nConclusions: The results suggest that in COPD, PLB induced a favorable breathing pattern (increased TV and reduced RR) compared to QB. Additionally, WAS and WAHS positions increased muscle activity of the inspiratory accessory muscles during inspiration versus NP. Differential involvement of accessory respiratory muscles can be readily studied in COPD patients, allowing monitoring of respiratory load during pulmonary rehabilitation."

While natural head position is a standardized position, natural head posture is a physiologic position of the head, when taking the first step forward from the standing to a moving or walking posture. \"Orthoposition\" is characteristic for a person and reproducible, but differs among persons. Cephalometrics is constantly undergoing refinements in its techniques and analyses to improve the clinical applications.

  "abstract": "Previous literature suggests that older adults and persons with Parkinson's disease (PWP) exhibit impaired performance during gait initiation (GI) and turning while walking. While researchers have identified specific impairments during GI and turning separately in these populations, little is known about when these two tasks occur concurrently. Our objective was to determine how multi-directional GI kinematics are affected by aging and Parkinson's disease. Kinematic data were collected on 12 healthy young adults (HYA), 11 healthy older adults (HOA) and 11 PWP during GI in four conditions: forward, medial 45°, lateral 45°, and lateral 90°. Spatiotemporal characteristics and segmental angles were analyzed using separate 3 (group)×4 (condition) mixed ANOVA. Combined across all the conditions, HOA took a smaller (P=0.009) and slower (P=0.023) first step, and slower second step (P=0.021) compared to HYA. PWP took a slower first step (P=0.009), and longer time to initiate the second step (P=0.017) compared to HOA. Also, PWP had greater head rotation at the start of GI during the medial 45° condition (P=0.043) and reduced overall segmental rotation before toe-off of the second step during the lateral 45° condition (P=0.035), and at heel-strike of first step (P=0.031) and before toe-off of second step during lateral 90° condition (P=0.035). For HOA, their general slowness of movement could be attributed to aging effects. For PWP, rigidity and bradykinesia could impair activities of daily living like multi-directional GI and may be associated with an increased risk of falls."

  "date": "2012 Sep 21",
  "abstract": "New generation pilot helmets with mounted devices enhance the capabilities of pilots substantially. However, the additional equipment increases the helmet weight and shifts its center of mass forward. Two helmets with different mass properties were modeled to simulate their effects on the pilot's neck. A musculoskeletal computer model was used, with the methods of inverse dynamics and static optimization, to compute the muscle activations and joint reaction forces for a given range of quasi-static postures at various accelerations experienced during air combat. Head postures which induce much higher loads on the cervical spine than encountered in a neutral position could be identified. The increased weight and the forward shift of the center of mass of a new generation helmet lead to higher muscle activations and higher joint reaction loads over a wide range of head and neck movements. The muscle activations required to balance the head and neck in extreme postures increased the compressive force at the T1-C7 level substantially, while in a neutral posture the muscle activations remained low. The lateral neck muscles can reach activations of 100% and cause compressive joint forces up to 1100N during extensive rotations and extensions at high 'vertical' accelerations (Gz). The calculated values have to be interpreted with care as the model has not been validated. Nevertheless, this systematic analysis could separate the effects of head posture, acceleration and helmet mass on neck loading. More reliable data about mass properties and muscle morphometry with a more detailed motion analysis would help to refine the existing model."

  "date": "2012",
  "abstract": "It is now standard practice, at Universities around the world, for academics to place pictures of themselves on a personal profile page maintained as part of their University's web-site. Here we investigated what these pictures reveal about the way academics see themselves. Since there is an asymmetry in the degree to which emotional information is conveyed by the face, with the left side being more expressive than the right, we hypothesised that academics in the sciences would seek to pose as non-emotional rationalists and put their right cheek forward, while academics in the arts would express their emotionality and pose with the left cheek forward. We sourced 5829 pictures of academics from their University websites and found that, consistent with the hypotheses, there was a significant difference in the direction of face posing between science academics and English academics with English academics showing a more leftward orientation. Academics in the Fine Arts and Performing Arts however, did not show the expected left cheek forward bias. We also analysed profile pictures of psychology academics and found a greater bias toward presenting the left check compared to science academics which makes psychologists appear more like arts academics than scientists. These findings indicate that the personal website pictures of academics mirror the cultural perceptions of emotional expressiveness across disciplines."

  "title": "Modeling body state-dependent multisensory integration",
  "date": "2012 Aug",
  "abstract": "The brain often integrates multisensory sources of information in a way that is close to the optimal according to Bayesian principles. Since sensory modalities are grounded in different, body-relative frames of reference, multisensory integration requires accurate transformations of information. We have shown experimentally, for example, that a rotating tactile stimulus on the palm of the right hand can influence the judgment of ambiguously rotating visual displays. Most significantly, this influence depended on the palm orientation: when facing upwards, a clockwise rotation on the palm yielded a clockwise visual judgment bias; when facing downwards, the same clockwise rotation yielded a counterclockwise bias. Thus, tactile rotation cues biased visual rotation judgment in a head-centered reference frame. Recently, we have generated a modular, multimodal arm model that is able to mimic aspects of such experiments. The model co-represents the state of an arm in several modalities, including a proprioceptive, joint angle modality as well as head-centered orientation and location modalities. Each modality represents each limb or joint separately. Sensory information from the different modalities is exchanged via local forward and inverse kinematic mappings. Also, re-afferent sensory feedback is anticipated and integrated via Kalman filtering. Information across modalities is integrated probabilistically via Bayesian-based plausibility estimates, continuously maintaining a consistent global arm state estimation. This architecture is thus able to model the described effect of posture-dependent motion cue integration: tactile and proprioceptive sensory information may yield top-down biases on visual processing. Equally, such information may influence top-down visual attention, expecting particular arm-dependent motion patterns. Current research implements such effects on visual processing and attention."

At three-month follow-up, there were still significant differences in all the previous variables (P < 0.005). In contrast, while there was no significant difference with respect to Functional Rating Index at 10 weeks (P = 0.8), the three-month follow-up showed a significant difference (P = 0.001).\nConclusion: A forward head corrective exercise programme combined with conventional rehabilitation improved three-dimensional scoliotic posture and functional status in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis."

Feedback from the L4 erector spinae reduced the trunk flexion and forward head angles, which were significantly different compared with those under the feedback from the upper trapezius and the control conditions (p<0.05).\nConclusion: We observed that the use of an EMG-based feedback device was effective in reducing habitual forward head and flexed-relaxed postures during computer operation. Additionally, posture correction from the lumbar region could be a way to reduce forward head posture as well as flexed-relaxed posture."

  "title": "Position-dependent accommodative shift of retropupillary fixated iris-claw lenses",
  "date": "2012 Dec",
  "abstract": "Purpose: After implantation of retropupillary fixated iris-claw lenses, changes of the objective refraction can occur depending on the patients' position. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and quantify these changes as well as the influencing factors.\nMethods: Within a retrospective study, postoperative refraction visual, acuity and anterior chamber depth after implantation of a retropupillary fixated iris-claw lens (Artisan® / Verisyse®) were measured in 51 eyes (49 patients) depending on their head position. These parameters were determined with the assistance of a mobile auto-refractometer, acoustic biometry, IOL-Master, chart projector and accommodometer in primary position, as well as in forward- and backward-tilted head position.\nResults: The data analysis indicated a position-dependent change of the anterior chamber depth, which was largest in the backward-tilted head position (median: 4.25 mm/min.: 3.39 mm/max.: 5.37 mm). In comparison to the primary position (4.15 mm), it decreased in a forward-tilted position of the head (4.08 mm). A significant difference in anterior chamber depth was verified for backward- and forward-tilted heads (median: 0.155 mm). Refraction showed a significant difference (0.37 D) between forward- and backward-tilted head position. In comparison to the back-tilted head position (mean: -0.065 D), a smaller spherical equivalent could be demonstrated by bending the head forward (mean: -0.438 D). In addition, no correlation was found between lens movement and other continuous attributes.\nConclusions: Significant changes in anterior chamber depth and refraction due to the iris-claw lens shift were found, depending on head position. The phenomenon of pseudophakic accommodation is explained by pseudo-myopia and pseudo-hyperopia. A considerable influence on visual acuity depending on patients´ head position could not be verified."

  "title": "Exercise interventions for shoulder dysfunction in patients treated for head and neck cancer",
  "date": "2012 Apr 18",
  "abstract": "Background: Shoulder dysfunction is a common problem in patients treated for head and neck cancer. Both neck dissections and radiotherapy can cause morbidity to the shoulder joint. Exercise interventions have been suggested as a treatment option for this population.\nObjectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of exercise interventions for the treatment of shoulder dysfunction caused by the treatment of head and neck cancer.\nSearch methods: We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 7 July 2011.\nSelection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of exercise therapy compared with any other intervention in patients with shoulder dysfunction due to treatment of head and neck cancer.\nData collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from studies. We contacted study authors for information not provided in the published articles.\nMain results: Three trials involving 104 people were included. We classified one study as having low risk of bias; the others had some limitations and we classified them as having high risk of bias.Two studies (one with low risk of bias and the other with high risk of bias) applied progressive resistance training (PRT) combined with range of motion exercises and stretching; the comparison group received standard care. Pooled data demonstrated that PRT can improve shoulder pain (mean difference (MD) -6.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) -12.20 to -0.31) and shoulder disability (MD -8.48; 95% CI -15.07 to -1.88), both measured using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) (range 0 to 100). Similarly, secondary outcomes were also improved: active range of motion for external rotation (MD 14.51 degrees; 95% CI 7.87 to 21.14), passive range of motion for abduction (MD 7.65 degrees; 95% CI 0.64 to 14.66), forward flexion (MD 6.20 degrees; 95% CI 0.69 to 11.71), external rotation (MD 7.17 degrees; 95% CI 2.20 to 12.14) and horizontal abduction (MD 7.34 degrees; 95% CI 2.86 to 11.83). Strength and resistance of scapular muscles was assessed in one study and the results showed a statistically significant benefit of PRT. The studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in quality of life. Only two non-serious adverse events were described in the PRT group compared with none in the standard care group.One study with high risk of bias used a broad spectrum of techniques including free active exercises, stretching and postural care for a period of three months following surgery. This study did not demonstrate a difference between the exercise group and routine postoperative physiotherapy care in shoulder function and quality of life, but serious methodological limitations could explain this. No serious adverse events were reported.\nAuthors' conclusions: Limited evidence from two RCTs demonstrated that PRT is more effective than standard physiotherapy treatment for shoulder dysfunction in patients treated for head and neck cancer, improving pain, disability and range of motion of the shoulder joint, but it does not improve quality of life. However, although statistically significant the measured benefits of the intervention may be small. Other exercise regimes were not shown to be effective compared to routine postoperative physiotherapy. Further studies which apply other exercise interventions in head and neck cancer patients in the early postoperative and radiotherapy period are needed, with long-term follow-up."

  "title": "The effect of the forward head posture on postural balance in long time computer based worker",
  "date": "2012 Feb",
  "abstract": "Objective: To estimate the effects of a relatively protruded head and neck posture on postural balance, in computer based worker.\nMethod: Thirty participants, who work with computers for over 6 hrs per day (Group I), and thirty participants, who rarely work with computers (Group II), were enrolled. The head and neck posture was measured by estimating angles A and B. A being the angle between the tragus of the ear, the lateral canthus of the eye, and horizontal line and B the angle between the C7 spinous process, the tragus of the ear, and the horizontal line. The severity of head protrusion with neck extension was assessed by the subtraction of angle A from angle B. We also measured the center of gravity (COG) and postural balance by using computerized dynamic posturography to determine the effect of computer-based work on postural balance.\nResults: Results indicated that group I had a relatively more protruded head with extensive neck posture (angle B-A of group I and group II, 28.2±8.3, 32.9±6.0; p<.05). The COG of group I tended more toward the anterior than that of group II. Postural imbalance and impaired ability to regulate movement in forward and backward direction were also found.\nConclusion: The results of this study suggest that forward head postures during computer-based work may contribute to some disturbance in the balance of healthy adults. These results could be applied to education programs regarding correct postures when working at a computer for extended periods of time."

  "date": "2012 Jul",
  "abstract": "Background: Daily experiences are thought to play an important role in motor development during infancy. There are limited studies on the effect of postural and movement experiences on head control.\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of postural and movement experiences on head control through a comprehensive set of measurements beginning when infants were 1 month old.\nDesign: This was a prospective, longitudinal, 2-cohort study.\nMethods: Twenty-two full-term infants who were healthy were randomly assigned to either a training group or a control group. Infants were observed every other week from 1 to 4 months of age. Head control was assessed using a standardized developmental assessment tool, the Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP), as well as behavioral coding and kinematics of infants' head postures and movements in a supported sitting position. Caregivers performed at least 20 minutes of daily postural and movement activities (training group), or social interaction (control group) for 4 weeks.\nResults: The training group had higher TIMP scores on head control-related items during the training period and after training stopped compared with the control group. Starting from the during training phase, the training group infants had their heads in a vertical and midline position longer compared with the control group infants. After training stopped, the training group infants actively moved their heads forward more often and for larger distances.\nLimitations: The experiences outside daily training were not monitored, and the results may be specific to the experimental setup for infants with typical development.\nConclusions: Young infants are able to take advantage of postural and movement experiences to rapidly advance their head control as early as 4 to 6 weeks of postnatal life. Infant positioning, caregiver handling, and caregiver-infant interactions were likely contributing factors. This database of comprehensive measures may be useful in future trials focused on head control in infants with special needs."

  "title": "Head impact contact points for restrained child occupants",
  "date": "2012",
  "abstract": "Objective: Head injuries are the most common injuries sustained by children in motor vehicle crashes regardless of age, restraint, and crash direction. For rear seat occupants, the interaction of the subject with the seat back and the vehicle side interior structures has been previously highlighted. In order to advance this knowledge to the development of countermeasures, a summary of vehicle components that contributed to these injuries is needed. Therefore, the objective of this study was to create a contact map of the vehicle interior for head and face injuries to rear-seated restrained children in front crashes.\nMethods: The Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) was queried for rear-seated, restrained child occupants (age 0-15 years) in forward-facing child restraints, booster seats, or lap and shoulder belts who sustained an AIS2+ head and/or face injury in a frontal motor vehicle crash. Cases were analyzed to describe injury patterns and injury causation scenarios. A contact point map was developed to summarize the vehicle components related to injury causation of the head/face injury.\nResults: Twenty-one cases met the combined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seven of the child occupants were restrained in forward-facing child restraints, 2 in belt-positioning booster seats, and 12 in lap and shoulder belts. There were 28 head and 17 facial injuries. For left rear occupants, the most common contact point was the pillar in front of the occupant's seat row; that is, B-pillar for second-row occupants, indicating a leftward kinematics. For right rear occupants, due to differences in crash dynamics, the most common contact point location was the passenger's seat back, suggesting that these occupants moved predominantly forward.\nConclusions: Contact points associated with head/face injury for restrained children 0 to 15 years in frontal crashes have been delineated. In a majority of the cases, the head/face injury was the most severe injury and severe injuries to other body regions were uncommon, suggesting that efforts to mitigate head injuries for these occupants would greatly improve their overall safety. The majority of the head/face contact points were to the first row seat back and B-pillar. In these frontal crashes, the importance of head/face contact with the vehicle side structure suggests that deploying a curtain air bag in frontal impacts may help manage the energy of impact. These data advance the current understanding of injury patterns and causation in frontal crashes involving restrained rear-row occupants and can be used to develop solutions to mitigate the injuries sustained."

  "title": "Impact of chronic exercise training on the blood pressure response to orthostatic stimulation",
  "date": "2012 Jun",
  "abstract": "Exercise training elicits morphological adaptations in the left ventricle (LV) and large-conduit arteries that are specific to the type of training performed (i.e., endurance vs. resistance exercise). We investigated whether the mode of chronic exercise training, and the associated cardiovascular adaptations, influence the blood pressure responses to orthostatic stimulation in 30 young healthy men (10 sedentary, 10 endurance trained, and 10 resistance trained). The endurance-trained group had a significantly larger LV end-diastolic volume normalized by body surface area (vs. sedentary and resistance-trained groups), whereas the resistance-trained group had a significantly higher LV wall thickness and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) compared with the endurance-trained group. In response to 60° head-up tilt (HUT), mean arterial pressure (MAP) rose in the resistance-trained group (+6.5 ± 1.6 mmHg, P < 0.05) but did not change significantly in sedentary and the endurance-trained groups. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased in endurance-trained group (-8.3 ± 2.4 mmHg, P < 0.05) but did not significantly change in sedentary and resistance-trained groups. A forward stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that LV wall thickness and aortic PWV were significantly and independently associated with the MAP response to HUT, explaining ∼41% of its variability (R(2) =0.414, P < 0.001). Likewise, aortic PWV and the corresponding HUT-mediated change in stroke volume were significantly and independently associated with the SBP response to HUT, explaining ∼52% of its variability (R(2) = 0.519, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the change in stroke volume significantly correlated with LV wall thickness (r = 0.39, P < 0.01). These results indicate that chronic resistance and endurance exercise training differentially affect the BP response to HUT, and that this appears to be associated with training-induced morphological adaptations of the LV and large-conduit arteries."

  "title": "Effect of head orientation on postural control during upright stance and forward lean",
  "date": "2012 Jan",
  "abstract": "Sensory feedback from the vestibular system and neck muscle stretch receptors is critical for the regulation of postural control. The postural relationship of the head to the trunk is a major factor determining the integration of sensory feedback and can be interfered with by varying head orientation. This study assessed how 60-s of standing with the head neutral, flexed, or extended impacted postural stability during upright stance and during forward lean in 13 healthy participants (26 ±5 years old). During both quiet upright stance and maximal forward lean, head extension increased postural center of pressure (COP) velocity and decreased the COP time-to-contact the anterior stability boundary compared with the head neutral condition. Head flexion did not differ from head neutral for either of the stance conditions. This study demonstrates that interfering with the head-trunk relationship by adopting extended, but not flexed, head orientations interferes with postural control that may impact postural stability during both quiet upright stance and maximal forward lean conditions."

  "date": "2013 Apr",
  "abstract": "Bringing the head and neck of ridden horses into a position of hyperflexion is widely used in equestrian sports. In our study, the hypothesis was tested that hyperflexion is an acute stressor for horses. Salivary cortisol concentrations, heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and superficial body temperature were determined in horses (n = 16) lunged on two subsequent days. The head and neck of the horse was fixed with side reins in a position allowing forward extension on day A and fixed in hyperflexion on day B. The order of treatments alternated between horses. In response to lunging, cortisol concentration increased (day A from 0.73 ± 0.06 to 1.41 ± 0.13 ng/ml, p < 0.001; day B from 0.68 ± 0.07 to 1.38 ± 0.13 ng/ml, p < 0.001) but did not differ between days A and B. Beat-to-beat (RR) interval decreased in response to lunging on both days. HRV variables standard deviation of RR interval (SDRR) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive RR differences) decreased (p < 0.001) but did not differ between days. In the cranial region of the neck, the difference between maximum and minimum temperature was increased in hyperflexion (p < 0.01). In conclusion, physiological parameters do not indicate an acute stress response to hyperflexion of the head alone in horses lunged at moderate speed and not touched with the whip. However, if hyperflexion is combined with active intervention of a rider, a stressful experience for the horse cannot be excluded."

  "abstract": "The aim of this report was to give ergonomic recommendations in order to prevent musculoskeletal symptoms/disorders among young people due to intensive texting on mobile phones. In a study of 56 Swedish young adults (19-25 years, 41 with musculoskeletal symptoms in neck and/or upper extremities and 15 without symptoms) registration of thumb movements with electrogoniometry, muscle activity with electromyography and observation of texting technique were conducted during texting on mobile phones. The results showed differences in physical load between the group with musculoskeletal symptoms and the group without symptoms. There were also found differences in muscle activity and kinematics between different texting techniques. These differences could not be explained by the asymptomatic group having symptoms but may be a possible contribution to their symptoms. According to these results it can be recommended to support the forearms, to use both thumbs, to avoid sitting with the head bent forward and to avoid texting with high velocity in order to prevent musculoskeletal disorders when using mobile phones for texting."

  "abstract": "There are several instruments of evaluation of the craniocervical equilibrium; the most reliable are the radiographies. This study used the cephalometric analysis of Rocabado to measure the sensibility and specificity of the Cervical Range of Motion (CROM), a goniometer designed to assess cervical movements in degrees, and measure the forward head position in centimeters. This instrument frequently used, has been tested as a reliable instrument to evaluate the cervical movements but not the forward head. The sample consisted of 30 volunteers, 18 females, 12 males, mean age of 24.63 years. All participants were evaluated with CROM and radiographies in the resting head position and in erect head position. The values considered by the cephalometry consisted in the angle made between the McGregor plane and the vertical line formed by the base of the odontoid process to its apex; the posterior space between C0-C1 and C1-C2 and the hyoid triangle.\nResults: 30% of the subjects had forward head posture, according to de cephalometry of Rocabado (decreased space between C0-C1, C1-C2) and 43,3% according to CROM. 16,6% had decreased posterior-inferior angle, and 13% had the hyoid triangle facing up. ROC curve of identifying forward head posture yielded area under the curve of 0,778 (95% confidence interval 0,596-0,960). The sensibility of CROM was: 77%. The specificity 71%.\nConclusion: This study suggests that CROM has a moderate sensibility and specificity, useful for clinic use, but not for research."

This was repeated over three consecutive weeks using backpacks containing randomly assigned weights of 10%, 15%, or 20% body weight of each respective subject. The craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured using digitizing software, recorded and analyzed.\nResults: Subjects demonstrated immediate and statistically significant changes in CVA, indicating increased forward head positions upon donning the backpacks containing 15% and 20% body weight. Following the 6MWT, the CVA demonstrated further statistically significant changes for all backpack loads indicating increased forward head postures. For the 15 & 20%BW conditions, more than 50% of the subjects reported discomfort after walking, with the neck as the primary location of reported pain.\nConclusions: Backpack loads carried by schoolchildren should be limited to 10% body weight due to increased forward head positions and subjective complaints at 15% and 20% body weight loads."

Twenty-three children (age 9.2 +/- 70.88 years) diagnosed with maxillary constriction were randomly divided into two groups: 1. Study group (n = 12): patients receiving RPE treatment; 2. Untreated controls (n = 11). Postural measurements were taken on frontal, lateral, and dorsal views of each subject. In the study group measurements were taken at T0 (the day orthodontic records were taken), T1 (end of RPE active phase), and T2 (RPE removal). In controls the same observations were conducted at T0 and T1(98.18 +/- 36.01 days after T0). Measurements were statistically analyzed (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, t-tests, Signed Rank test, One-Way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance, Tukey test; p < 0.05).\nResults: In the study group a significant reduction in forward head posture (FHP) occurred between T0 and T1. Forward shoulder posture (FSP) decreased significantly between T1 and T2. At T1 treated patients exhibited significantly lower values of the measurements indicating FHP and FSP than controls.\nConclusion: Changes in head and scapular posture following RPE treatment can be documented with computerized measurements on digital photographs."

Patients were initially positioned in the 15° Trendelenburg position with their heads rotated 30° to the left. The ultrasound probe was placed perpendicular to the skin, and the images of the right IJV and CCA were collected at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Following laryngeal mask airway placement, images were collected in the same manner.\nResults: No statistically significant changes were observed in the overlap index before and after laryngeal mask airway placement. By inflating the laryngeal mask airway cuff, migration of the vessel forward was 24.38% and outward migration was 13.99%.\nConclusion: There was no remarkable change in the overlap index before and after laryngeal mask airway placement in children."

  "date": "2012 Feb 2",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify kinematic and dynamic variables related to the best tumble turn times (3mRTT, the turn time from 3-m in to 3-m out, independent variable) in ten elite male swimmers using a three-dimensional (3D) underwater analysis protocol and the Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) as statistical method. For each swimmer, the best-time turn was analyzed with five stationary and synchronized underwater cameras. The 3D reconstruction was performed using the Direct Linear Transformation algorithm. An underwater piezoelectric 3D force platform completed the set-up to compute dynamic variables. Data were smoothed by the Savitzky-Golay filtering method. Three variables were considered relevant in the best Lasso model (3mRTT=2.58-0.425 RD+0.204 VPe+0.0046 TD): the head-wall distance where rotation starts (RD), the horizontal speed at the force peak (VPe), and the 3D length of the path covered during the turn (TD). Furthermore, bivariate analysis showed that upper body (CUBei) and lower limb extension indexes at first contact (CLLei) were also linked to the turn time (r=-0.65 and p<0.05 for both variables). Thus the best turn times were associated with a long RD, slower VPe and reduced TD. By an early transverse rotation, male elite swimmers reach the wall with a slightly flexed posture that results in fast extension. These swimmers opt for a movement that is oriented forward and they focus on reducing the distance covered."

  "title": "Is head-on-trunk extension a proprioceptive mediator of postural control and sit-to-stand movement characteristics?",
  "date": "2011",
  "abstract": "During stance, head extension increases postural sway, possibly due to interference with sensory feedback. The sit-to-stand movement is potentially destabilizing due to the development of momentum as the trunk flexes forward and the body transitions to a smaller base of support. It is unclear what role head orientation plays in the postural and movement characteristics of the sit-to-stand transition. The authors assessed how moving from sitting to standing with head-on-trunk extension compared with moving with the head neutral or flexed, or with moving with the head facing forward in space (which would involve head-on-trunk extension, but not head-in-space extension) in healthy, young participants. Head-on-trunk extension increased center of pressure variability, but decreased movement velocities, movement duration, and trunk flexion compared with flexed and neutral head-on-trunk orientations. Similarities in movement characteristics between head-on-trunk extension and the forward head-in-space orientation suggest that stabilizing the head in space does not fully counteract the postural and movement changes due to head-on-trunk extension. Findings suggest that proprioceptive feedback from the neck muscles contributes to the regulation of posture and movement, and therefore should not be overlooked in research on the role of sensory feedback in postural control."

  "title": "Rib stress fractures among rowers: definition, epidemiology, mechanisms, risk factors and effectiveness of injury prevention strategies",
  "date": "2011 Nov 1",
  "abstract": "Rib stress fractures (RSFs) can have serious effects on rowing training and performance and accordingly represent an important topic for sports medicine practitioners. Therefore, the aim of this review is to outline the definition, epidemiology, mechanisms, intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, injury management and injury prevention strategies for RSF in rowers. To this end, nine relevant books, 140 journal articles, the proceedings of five conferences and two unpublished presentations were reviewed after searches of electronic databases using the keywords 'rowing', 'rib', 'stress fracture', 'injury', 'mechanics' and 'kinetics'. The review showed that RSF is an incomplete fracture occurring from an imbalance between the rate of bone resorption and the rate of bone formation. RSF occurs in 8.1-16.4% of elite rowers, 2% of university rowers and 1% of junior elite rowers. Approximately 86% of rowing RSF cases with known locations occur in ribs four to eight, mostly along the anterolateral/lateral rib cage. Elite rowers are more likely to experience RSF than nonelite rowers. Injury occurrence is equal among sweep rowers and scullers, but the regional location of the injury differs. The mechanism of injury is multifactorial with numerous intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors contributing. Posterior-directed resultant forces arising from the forward directed force vector through the arms to the oar handle in combination with the force vector induced by the scapula retractors during mid-drive, or repetitive stress from the external obliques and rectus abdominis in the 'finish' position, may be responsible for RSF. Joint hypomobility, vertebral malalignment or low bone mineral density may be associated with RSF. Case studies have shown increased risk associated with amenorrhoea, low bone density or poor technique, in combination with increases in training volume. Training volume alone may have less effect on injury than other factors. Large differences in seat and handle velocity, sequential movement patterns, higher elbow-flexion to knee-extension strength ratios, higher seat-to-handle velocity during the initial drive, or higher shoulder angle excursion may result in RSF. Gearing may indirectly affect rib loading. Increased risk may be due to low calcium, low vitamin D, eating disorders, low testosterone or use of depot medroxyprogesterone injections. Injury management involves 1-2 weeks cessation of rowing with analgesic modalities followed by a slow return to rowing with low-impact intensity and modified pain-free training. Some evidence shows injury prevention strategies should focus on strengthening the serratus anterior, strengthening leg extensors, stretching the lumbar spine, increasing hip joint flexibility, reducing excessive protraction, training with ergometers on slides or floating-head ergometers, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Future research should focus on the epidemiology of RSF over 4-year Olympic cycles in elite rowers, the aetiology of the condition, and the effectiveness of RSF prevention strategies for injury incidence and performance in rowing."

  "title": "Influence of orbital eye position on vertical saccades in progressive supranuclear palsy",
  "date": "2011 Sep",
  "abstract": "Disturbance of vertical saccades is a cardinal feature of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We investigated whether the amplitude and peak velocity (PV) of saccades are affected by the orbital position from which movements start in PSP patients and age-matched control subjects. Subjects made vertical saccades in response to ±5° vertical target jumps with their heads in one of three positions: head \"center,\" head pitched forward ∼15°, and head pitched back ∼15°. All patients showed some effect of starting eye position, whether beginning in the upward or downward field of gaze, on saccade amplitude, PV, and net range of movement. Generally, reduction of amplitude and PV were commensurate and bidirectional in the affected hemifield of gaze. Such findings are unlikely to be because of orbital factors and could be explained by varying degrees of involvement of rostral midbrain nuclei in the pathological process."

  "date": "2012 Feb",
  "abstract": "Reduced cervical range of motion (ROM) is a common finding in people with neck pain. With few exceptions, only the angle between head and thorax has been measured. Our aim was to use an extended model to compare active cervical flexion and extension, separate for upper and lower cervical levels, between people with chronic non-traumatic neck pain and controls. We also investigated associations between ROM measures, symptoms and self-rated functioning. In this cross-sectional study, 102 subjects with neck pain and 33 healthy controls participated. An electromagnetic tracker system was used to measure the kinematics to construct a three-segment model including the thorax, cervical spine and head. Neutral flexion/extension were defined at subjects' self-selected seated posture. We found that in the neck pain group, extension in the upper cervical levels and predominately flexion for the lower levels were reduced. The ratio between ROM for the upper and lower levels was altered in the neck pain group so that the lower levels contributed to a lesser extent to the total sagittal ROM compared to controls. These findings could not be explained by a greater forward head posture but must have other origins. For the neck pain group, ROM measures were weakly associated to pain and self-rated functioning. Altogether, this implies that using a three-segment model for assessment of ROM can be a valuable improvement for characterisation of patients and treatment evaluation."

  "date": "2011 Dec",
  "abstract": "Postural reactions in healthy individuals in the seated position have previously been described and have been shown to depend on the direction of the perturbation; however the neck response following forward and backward translations has not been compared. The overall objective of the present study was to compare neck and trunk kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic (EMG) stabilization patterns of seated healthy individuals to forward and backward translations. Ten healthy individuals, seated on a chair fixed onto a movable platform, were exposed to forward and backward translations (distance=0.15m, peak acceleration=1.2m/s(2)). The head and trunk kinematics as well as the EMG activity of 16 neck and trunk muscles were recorded. Neck and trunk angular displacements were computed in the sagittal plane. The centers of mass (COMs) of the head (HEAD), upper thorax (UPTX), lower thorax (LOWTX) and abdomen (ABDO) segments were also computed. Moments of force at the C7-T1 and L5-S1 levels were calculated using a top-down, inverse dynamics approach. Forward translations provoked greater overall COM peak displacements. The first peak of moment of force was also reached earlier following forward translations which may have played a role in preventing the trunk from leaning backwards. These responses can be explained by the higher postural threat imposed by a forward translation."

  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate submaximal exercise tolerance and respiratory muscle strength in relation to forward head posture (FHP) and respiratory mode in children, comparing mouth-breathing (MB) children with nasal-breathing (NB) children.\nMethods: This was a controlled, analytical cross-sectional study involving children in the 8-12 year age bracket with a clinical otorhinolaryngology diagnosis of MB, recruited between October of 2010 and January of 2011 from the Mouth Breather Clinic at the State University of Campinas Hospital de Clínicas, located in the city of Campinas, Brazil. The exclusion criteria were obesity, asthma, chronic respiratory diseases, heart disease, and neurological or orthopedic disorders. All of the participants underwent postural assessment and the six-minute walk test (6MWT), together with determination of MIP and MEP.\nResults: Of the 92 children in the study, 30 presented with MB and 62 presented with NB. In the MB group, the differences between those with moderate or severe FHP and those with normal head posture, in terms of the mean MIP, MEP and six-minute walk distance (6MWD), were not significant (p = 0.079, p = 0.622, and p = 0.957, respectively). In the NB group, the mean values of MIP and MEP were higher in the children with moderate FHP than in those with normal head posture (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively). The mean MIP, MEP, and 6MWD were lower in the MB group than in the NB group. Values of MIP and MEP were highest in the children with moderate FHP.\nConclusions: Respiratory biomechanics and exercise capacity were negatively affected by MB. The presence of moderate FHP acted as a compensatory mechanism in order to improve respiratory muscle function."

  "date": "2012 Apr",
  "abstract": "The amphibian Xenopus laevis represents a highly amenable model system for exploring the ontogeny of central neural networks, the functional establishment of sensory-motor transformations, and the generation of effective motor commands for complex behaviors. Specifically, the ability to employ a range of semi-intact and isolated preparations for in vitro morphophysiological experimentation has provided new insights into the developmental and integrative processes associated with the generation of locomotory behavior during changing life styles. In vitro electrophysiological studies have begun to explore the functional assembly, disassembly and dynamic plasticity of spinal pattern generating circuits as Xenopus undergoes the developmental switch from larval tail-based swimming to adult limb-based locomotion. Major advances have also been made in understanding the developmental onset of multisensory signal processing for reactive gaze and posture stabilizing reflexes during self-motion. Additionally, recent evidence from semi-intact animal and isolated CNS experiments has provided compelling evidence that in Xenopus tadpoles, predictive feed-forward signaling from the spinal locomotor pattern generator are engaged in minimizing visual disturbances during tail-based swimming. This new concept questions the traditional view of retinal image stabilization that in vertebrates has been exclusively attributed to sensory-motor transformations of body/head motion-detecting signals. Moreover, changes in visuomotor demands associated with the developmental transition in propulsive strategy from tail- to limb-based locomotion during metamorphosis presumably necessitates corresponding adaptive alterations in the intrinsic spinoextraocular coupling mechanism. Consequently, Xenopus provides a unique opportunity to address basic questions on the developmental dynamics of neural network assembly and sensory-motor computations for vertebrate motor behavior in general."

  "title": "Gliding flight in Chrysopelea: turning a snake into a wing",
  "date": "2011 Dec",
  "abstract": "Although many cylindrical animals swim through water, flying snakes of the genus Chrysopelea are the only limbless animals that glide through air. Despite a lack of limbs, these snakes can actively launch by jumping, maintain a stable glide path without obvious control surfaces, maneuver, and safely land without injury. Jumping takeoffs employ vertically looped kinematics that seem to be different than any other behavior in limbless vertebrates, and their presence in a closely related genus suggests that gap-crossing may have been a behavioral precursor to the evolution of gliding in snakes. Change in shape of the body by dorsoventral flattening and high-amplitude aerial undulation comprise two key features of snakes' gliding behavior. As the snake becomes airborne, the body flattens sequentially from head to vent, forming a cross-sectional shape that is roughly triangular, with a flat surface and lateral \"lips\" that protrude ventrally on each side of the body; these may diminish toward the vent. This shape likely provides the snake with lift coefficients that peak at high angles of attack and gentle stall characteristics. A glide trajectory is initiated with the snake falling at a steep angle. As the snake rotates in the pitch axis, it forms a wide \"S\" shape and begins undulating in a complex three-dimensional pattern, with the body angled upward relative to the glide path. The head moves side-to-side, sending traveling waves posteriorly toward the tail, while the body (most prominently, the posterior end) oscillates in the vertical axis. These active movements while gliding are substantially different and more dynamic than those used by any other animal glider. As the snake gains forward speed, the glide path becomes less steep, reaching minimally recorded glide angles of 13°. In general, smaller snakes appear to be more proficient gliders. Chrysopelea paradisi can also maneuver and land either on the ground or on vegetation, but these locomotor behaviors have not been studied in detail. Future work aims to understand the mechanisms of production and control of force in takeoff, gliding, and landing, and to identify the musculoskeletal adaptations that enable this unique form of locomotion."

  "date": "2012 Feb",
  "abstract": "Alcohol-related falls are recognized as a major contributor to the occurrence of traumatic brain injury. The control of upright standing balance is complex and composes of contributions from several partly independent mechanisms such as appropriate information from multiple sensory systems and correct feedback and feed forward movement control. Analysis of multisegmented body movement offers a rarely used option for detecting the fine motor problems associated with alcohol intoxication. The study aims were to investigate whether (1) alcohol intoxication at 0.06 and 0.10% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) affected the body movements under unperturbed and perturbed standing; and (2) alcohol affected the ability for sensorimotor adaptation. Body movements were recorded in 25 participants (13 women and 12 men, mean age 25.1 years) at five locations (ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, and head) during quiet standing and during balance perturbations from pseudorandom pulses of calf muscle vibration over 200s with eyes closed or open. Tests were performed at 0.00, 0.06, and 0.10% BAC. The study revealed several significant findings: (1) an alcohol dose-specific effect; (2) a direction-specific stability decrease from alcohol intoxication; (3) a movement pattern change related to the level of alcohol intoxication during unperturbed standing and perturbed standing; (4) a sensorimotor adaptation deterioration with increased alcohol intoxication; and (5) that vision provided a weaker contribution to postural control during alcohol intoxication. Hence, alcohol intoxication at 0.06 and 0.10% BAC causes a complex multifaceted deterioration of human postural control."

A 3D motion analysis system measured head, neck and right upper extremity postures of 15 participants as they completed a 10 min computer task in six different configurations, all on a fixed height desk: no-incline, 12° incline, 25° incline, no-incline with external mouse, 25° incline with an external mouse, and a commercially available riser with external mouse and keyboard. After completion of the task, subjects rated the configuration for comfort and ease of use and indicated perceived discomfort in several body segments. Compared to the no-incline configuration, use of the 12° incline reduced forward head tilt and neck flexion while increasing wrist extension. The 25° incline further reduced head tilt and neck flexion while further increasing wrist extension. The 25° incline received the lowest comfort and ease of use ratings and the highest perceived discomfort score. For portable, temporary computing environments where internal input devices are used, users may find improved head and neck postures with acceptable wrist extension postures with the utilization of a 12° incline."

  "title": "Vertical torque responses to vestibular stimulation in standing humans",
  "date": "2011 Aug 15",
  "abstract": "The effects of electrical vestibular stimulation upon movement and perception suggest two evoked sensations: head roll and inter-aural linear acceleration. The head roll vector causes walking subjects to turn in a direction dependent on head pitch, requiring generation of torque around a vertical axis. Here the effect of vestibular stimulation upon vertical torque (T(z)) was investigated during quiet stance. With the head tilted forward, square-wave stimuli applied to the mastoid processes evoked a polarity-specific T(z) response accompanied by trunk yaw. Stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) was used to investigate the effect of head pitch with greater precision; the SVS–T(z) cross-correlation displayed a modulation pattern consistent with the head roll vector and this was also reflected by changes in coherence at 2–3 Hz. However, a separate response at 7–8 Hz was unaffected by head pitch. Head translation (rather than rotation) had no effect upon this high frequency response either, suggesting it is not caused by a sense of body rotation induced by an inter-aural acceleration vector offset from the body. Instead, high coherence between medio-lateral shear force and T(z) at the same frequency range suggests it is caused by mechanical coupling to evoked medio-lateral sway. Consistent with this explanation, the 7–8 Hz response was attenuated by 90 deg head roll or yaw, both of which uncouple the inter-aural axis from the medio-lateral sway axis. These results demonstrate two vertical torque responses to electrical vestibular stimulation in standing subjects. The high frequency response can be attributed to mechanical coupling to evoked medio-lateral sway. The low frequency response is consistent with a reaction to a sensation of head roll, and provides a novel method for investigating proprioceptive-vestibular interactions during stance."

  "date": "2011 Nov",
  "abstract": "Background: The objective of this study was to investigate differences in shoulder, elbow and hand kinetics while performing three different SPTs that varied in terms of hand and trunk positioning.\nMethods: Fourteen unimpaired individuals (8 male and 6 female) performed three variations of sitting pivot transfers in a random order from a wheelchair to a level tub bench. Two transfers involved a forward flexed trunk (head-hips technique) and the third with the trunk remaining upright. The two transfers involving a head hips technique were performed with two different leading hand initial positions. Motion analysis equipment recorded upper body movements and force sensors recorded hand reaction forces. Shoulder and elbow joint and hand kinetics were computed for the lift phase of the transfer.\nFindings: Transferring using either of the head hips techniques compared to the trunk upright style of transferring resulted in reduced superior forces at the shoulder (P<0.002), elbow (P<0.004) and hand (P<0.013). There was a significant increase in the medial forces in the leading elbow (P=0.049) for both head hip transfers and the trailing hand for the head hip technique with the arm further away from the body (P<0.028). The head hip techniques resulted in higher shoulder external rotation, flexion and extension moments compared to the trunk upright technique (P<0.021).\nInterpretation: Varying the hand placement and trunk positioning during transfers changes the load distribution across all upper limb joints. The results of this study may be useful for determining a technique that helps preserve upper limb function overtime."

  "abstract": "This study investigates the relative contribution of body parts in the elaboration of a whole-body egocentric attraction phenomenon previously observed during earth-based judgments. This was addressed through a particular earth-based task requiring estimating the possibility of passing under a projected line, imagining a forward horizontal displacement. Different postural configurations were tested, involving whole-body tilt, trunk tilt alone or head tilt alone. Two legs positions relative to the trunk were manipulated. Results showed systematic deviations of the subjective \"passability\" toward the tilt, linearly related to the tilt magnitude. For each postural configuration, the egocentric influence appeared to be highly dependent on the position of trunk and head axes, whereas the legs position appeared not relevant. When compared to the whole-body tilt condition, tilting the trunk alone consistently reduced the amount of the deviation toward the tilt, whereas tilting the head alone consistently increased it. Our results suggest that several specific effects from multiple body parts can account for the global deviation of the estimates observed during whole-body tilt. Most importantly, we support that the relative contribution of the body segments could mainly depend on a reweighting process, probably based on the reliability of sensory information available for a particular postural set."

  "abstract": "Introduction: Children with Down syndrome (DS) commonly have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and may assume a unique sleeping position not systematically described previously. We describe this sleep position in DS and explore its relationship with OSAS in comparison to control children (CC).\nMethods: Overnight video-polysomnograms (PSG) of consecutive children with DS (age 2-18 y), referred to our center between April 2008 and October 2009, were retrospectively analyzed by a single scorer (ES). CC group comprised age and gender matched, non-syndromic, neurologically intact children referred to us for suspected OSAS over the same period.\nResults: Each group had 17 subjects matched for age (median [IQR]; 6 [4-8]) and gender (65% female). DS group had higher BMI (median [IQR]; 18.8 [17.4-21.0]) than CC (17 [14.7 -18.8]; p = 0.03). There were however no significant differences (median [IQR]) between DS and CC with respect to sleep time in minutes (460 [425-499] vs 424[410-483]), sleep efficiency (%) (90.9 [87.4-92.4] vs 88.6 [79.9-93.1]), REM time (%) (17.1 [14.2-22.1] vs 19.2 [14.9-22.1]), supine time (%) (40.7 [24.8-56.0] vs 15.8 [0.40-44.5], p 0.06), mean oxygen saturation (%) (95 [94-96] vs 96 [95-97]), oxygen saturation nadir (89 [86-91] vs 89[94-92]), or total apnea-hypopnea index (4.3 [3-7.8] vs 5.1[1.9-9.6]). Despite these similarities between the groups, 9 (53%) DS children slept seated bent forward with head resting on bed for at least part of the total sleep time (%) (7.8 ± 10.9, range 0.8-35.7).This was absent in the CC group (p = 0.06).\nConclusion: Some DS children assume a peculiar body position, sitting cross-legged flopped-forward with head resting on bed while asleep. This is absent in age- and gender-matched controls showing otherwise similar PSG characteristics. The reason for this posture is unclear from this study. However, this novel report of a unique sleeping position would provide us with a basis to conduct a prospective study involving a larger population to ascertain the contribution of this position for OSAS protection or to determine if it may be forme fruste parasomnia."

  "abstract": "This study was designed to identify the effects of a visual feedback device for hip adduction on trunk muscles and sitting posture when working at a visual display terminal. The forward head and trunk flexion angles of 20 workers were analyzed using a motion analysis system, and the activities of the lower trapezius, external abdominal oblique, internal abdominal oblique, and L5 paraspinal muscles were analyzed using a electromyography system. The statistical significance of differences between using and not using a visual feedback device was assessed by paired t tests. Using the visual feedback device during Visual Display Terminal work significantly decreased the forward head and trunk flexion angles, and significantly increased the activities of the external abdominal oblique, internal abdominal oblique, and L5 paraspinal muscles. The authors suggest that the visual feedback device for hip adduction promotes the adoption of standard spine and pelvic postures, which might be effective in preventing poor sitting postures."

  "date": "2011 Apr 6",
  "abstract": "Most evidence that the brain uses Bayesian inference to integrate noisy sensory signals optimally has been obtained by showing that the noise levels in each modality separately can predict performance in combined conditions. Such a forward approach is difficult to implement when the various signals cannot be measured in isolation, as in spatial orientation, which involves the processing of visual, somatosensory, and vestibular cues. Instead, we applied an inverse probabilistic approach, based on optimal observer theory. Our goal was to investigate whether the perceptual differences found when probing two different states--body-in-space and head-in-space orientation--can be reconciled by a shared scheme using all available sensory signals. Using a psychometric approach, seven human subjects were tested on two orientation estimates at tilts < 120°: perception of body tilt [subjective body tilt (SBT)] and perception of visual vertical [subjective visual vertical (SVV)]. In all subjects, the SBT was more accurate than the SVV, which showed substantial systematic errors for tilt angles beyond 60°. Variability increased with tilt angle in both tasks, but was consistently lower in the SVV. The sensory integration model fitted both datasets very nicely. A further experiment, in which supine subjects judged their head orientation relative to the body, independently confirmed the predicted head-on-body noise by the model. Model predictions based on the derived noise properties from the various modalities were also consistent with previously published deficits in vestibular and somatosensory patients. We conclude that Bayesian computations can account for the typical differences in spatial orientation judgments associated with different task requirements."

  "abstract": "Neck muscle vibration (NMV) during upright standing is known to induce forward leaning, which has been explained as a global response to the (illusory) perception of a lengthening of the dorsal neck muscles. However, the effects of NMV both at the level of individual joints and on whole-body postural coordination, and its potential modulation by vision, have not yet been analyzed in detail. Eight healthy young adult participants completed a total of ten trials each, with a 10-s period of unperturbed standing followed by a 10-s period of NMV. Participants were instructed to stand \"as still as possible\". This postural task was executed under two visual conditions: eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC). Postural responses were measured in terms of center of pressure (CoP) and center of mass (CoM) profiles, and whole-body kinematics. Responses to NMV at the level of individual body segments and joints were assessed by decomposing the time series into linear trends and residual fluctuations. Inter-segmental coordination was analyzed using a decorrelation technique, assessing motor-equivalent stabilization of four task-related variables: CoM position, trunk orientation, as well as head position and orientation. NMV induced a general forward leaning response under both visual conditions, visible in CoP, CoM, segment positions and orientations. Locally, NMV induced a pronounced extension of the atlanto-occipital joint. Residual fluctuations were higher with EC and unaffected by NMV. Coordination analysis showed that stabilization of different body parts was differentially affected by NMV. Head orientation was consistently stabilized across all conditions, with weaker coordination in the EC condition. In contrast, motor-equivalent stabilization of CoM and head position, and trunk orientation was only observed during no-vibration periods. Taken together, our results demonstrate specific effects of vision and proprioception on different aspects of local and global postural control. While perturbed neck proprioception seemed to affect the postural \"set point\" (inducing forward leaning), vision appeared to mainly serve in noise reduction (residual fluctuations) and control of head orientation."

  "title": "An adaptive explanation for the horse-like shape of seahorses",
  "date": "2011 Jan 25",
  "abstract": "The body shape of seahorses resembles the head and neck of horses because of their curved trunk, their ventrally bent head and their long snout. Seahorses evolved from ancestral, pipefish-like species, which have a straight body. Here, we use a biomechanical analysis and show that the seahorse's peculiar head, neck and trunk posture allows for the capture of small shrimps at larger distances from the eyes compared with pipefish. The results from the mathematical modelling were confirmed by kinematic data of prey-capturing syngnathids: compared with straight-bodied pipefish, all seahorse species studied consistently show an additional forward-reaching component in the path travelled by the mouth during their strikes at prey. This increased strike distance enlarges the volume of water they can probe for food, which is especially useful for tail-attached, sit-and-wait predators like seahorses. The biomechanics of prey capture thus provides a putative selective advantage that may explain the bending of the trunk into a horse-like shape."

  "date": "2011",
  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate microswitch-cluster technology to help a post-coma man with multiple disabilities increase adaptive responding and reduce head forward tilting.\nMethod: The intervention programme initially focused on promoting a simple adaptive response (i.e. manipulating and moving a wobbling, ball-like device), which produced brief periods of preferred stimulation. Subsequently, this response produced the stimulation only if performed in the presence of head upright. Moreover, the stimulation lasted the scheduled time only if the head upright was maintained.\nResults: Data showed that the programme was successful in increasing the frequency of adaptive responses and in reducing the unhealthy posture of head forward tilting. Toward the end of the programme, the participant performed virtually all responses with his head upright and kept this posture through nearly the entire length of the sessions.\nConclusion: Microswitch-cluster technology might help post-coma persons with multiple disabilities improve adaptive engagement and head posture simultaneously."

  "title": "Effect of chin position on natural head orientation reproducibility",
  "date": "2011 May 1",
  "abstract": "Background and aims: Establishment of natural head position (NHP) in radiography or photography by estimation, which is called natural head orientation (NHO), has been recently advocated by various studies. This study aimed to determine the effect of chin position on the accuracy and reproducibility of NHO in a more realistic way.\nMaterials and methods: NHP-based digital photographs of 33 adults with normal profile were modified using the computer software Supper-Goo and Photoshop technique to produce 99 profile images in three groups with normal, forward and backward chin positions. The reconstructed images were presented to three observers who rotated the images through a circular hole on a computer monitor. The horizontal angle was read on screen and recorded whenever they found the best horizontally-oriented face. This was performed at four intervals: T0: baseline; T1: after 5 minutes; T2: after one week; and T3: one month after baseline.\nResults: After orientation, the mean orientation angles were 0.19°±1.39, 0.20°±1.53 and -0.31°±1.38 for the normal, forward and backward chin groups, respectively. T-test did not show any significant differences in NHO and NHP among the three groups of chin position: P values of 0.17, 0.19, and 0.26 for normal, forward, and backward chin positions, respectively. However, one-way ANOVA demonstrated significant differences in the NHO between the normal and backward, and backward and forward chin groups. The obtained reproducibility rate of NHO calculated via Med-Calc 8.1 online software for T0, T1, T2 and T3 intervals was more than 60%, which is regarded significant in medical studies.\nConclusion: Natural head position could be created with great reproducibility through orientation of profile images in different chin positions. NHO is under the influence of chin position; however, this influence is not clinically significant."

  "abstract": "Background: The mechanical alterations related to the overload of respiratory muscles observed in adults with persistent asthma might lead to the development of chronic alterations in posture, musculoskeletal dysfunction and pain; however, these changes remain poorly understood.\nObjective: This study aimed to assess postural alignment, muscle shortening and chronic pain in adults with persistent asthma.\nMethods: This cross-sectional and controlled study enrolled 30 patients with mild (n = 17) and severe (n = 13) persistent asthma. Fifteen non-asthmatic volunteers were also assessed. Asthma was classified by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. Postural alignment and muscle shortening were evaluated by head and shoulder positions, chest wall mobility, and posterior (trunk and lower limb) muscle flexibility. In addition, the measures used were previously tested for their reproducibility. Pain complaints were also assessed.\nResults: In comparison with non-asthmatic subjects, patients with mild or severe persistent asthma held their head and shoulders more forward and had lower chest wall expansion, decreased shoulder internal rotation, and decreased thoracic spine flexibility. Chronic lower thoracic, cervical, and shoulder pain was significantly increased in patients with mild or severe asthma compared with non-asthmatic subjects (p < 0.05).\nConclusion: Adults with persistent asthma have musculoskeletal dysfunction and chronic pain that is independent of the severity of their disease but that might be related to their age at the onset of disease symptoms."

  "date": "2010 Jul",
  "abstract": "Context and objective: Little is known about postural control among elderly individuals with osteoporosis and its relationship with falls. It has been suggested that elderly women with kyphosis and osteoporosis are at greater risk of falling. The aim of this study was to evaluate posture and postural control among elderly women with and without osteoporosis.\nDesign and setting: Cross-sectional study conducted at the Physical Therapy and Electromyography Laboratory, School of Medicine, Universidade de São Paulo (USP).\nMethods: Sixty-six elderly women were selected from the bone metabolism disorders clinic, Division of Rheumatology, USP, and were divided into two groups: osteoporosis and controls, according to their bone mineral density (BMD). Postural control was assessed using the Limits of Stability (LOS) test and the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance (CTSIBm) and posture, using photometry.\nResults: The elderly women with osteoporosis swayed at higher velocity on a stable surface with opened eyes (0.30 versus 0.20 degrees/second; P = 0.038). In both groups, the center of pressure (COP) was at 30% in the LOS, but with different placements: 156° in the osteoporosis group and 178° in the controls (P = 0.045). Osteoporosis patients fell more than controls did (1.0 versus 0.0; P = 0.036).\nConclusions: The postural control in elderly women with osteoporosis differed from that of the controls, with higher sway velocity and maximum displacement of COP. Despite postural abnormalities such as hyperkyphosis and forward head, the COP position was posteriorized."

  "date": "2011 Jan",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the two-dimensional kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) changes during the squat-to-reach task in older and young adults. Twenty-six older adults and thirty-three young adults were studied. A 16-channel telemetry system was used for recording muscular activity and kinematic data during two trials of a squat-to-reach task. Surface EMG data were recorded on select muscles of the trunk and the lower extremity on the dominant side. An electrogoniometer was fixed over the knee joint, and an inclinometer was fastened on the head and thigh to record kinematic data. The task was split into six movement phases based on the angular displacement and velocities of the knee joint. The mean values of the maximal displacements in the sagittal plane of the head, knee, and thigh were significantly (p<0.05) lower, but those in the frontal plane of the head and thigh were significantly (p<0.05) higher in older adults than in young adults. Thigh muscle activities were significantly (p<0.05) higher in older adults than in young adults throughout the movements. The trunk and leg muscles contracted earlier, but the hip adductors contracted later in older adults compared to young adults (p<0.05). The older adults squatted in a shallow and heel-off posture during forward reaching tasks. Therefore, older adults had increased lateral flexion of the head to compensate for insufficient knee flexion during the squat-to-reach movement and required increased activity of the posture muscles to maintain lateral stability."

  "date": "2011 Jan",
  "abstract": "This paper considers pre-impact vehicle maneuvers and analyzes the resulting driver motion from their comfort seating position. Part I of this work consisted of analyzing the driver behavior during a simulated crash in a car driving simulator. The configuration of the virtual accident led to an unavoidable frontal crash with a truck. The typical response to this type of emergency event was to brace rearward into the seat and to straighten the arms against the steering wheel, or, to swerve to attempt to avoid the impacting vehicle. In a turn crossover maneuvers, the forearm is directly positioned on the airbag module at time of crash. This position represents a potential injurious situation and is investigated in this Part II. Static airbag-deployment tests were realized in collaboration with Zodiac using conventional airbag (sewn cushion, pyrotechnical system and open event) and a Hybrid III 50th Male Dummy seated with the left arm positioned in the path of the deploying airbag. These experiments were numerically reproduced with Madymo and the ellipsoid Hybrid III dummy model. The dummy arm interaction with airbag was correlated with experiments. Then, a numerical simulation of a frontal collision at 56 km/h was realized. The results of the computational runs put forward injurious situations when the driver's arm was in front of the steering wheel. Indeed, in this case, the arm could hit the head under airbag deployment and induced serious neck bending and violent head launching. To mitigate head and neck trauma in this out-of-position situation, an airbag prototype (bonded cushion, two pure helium cold gas generators allowing mono- or multi-stage inflating, patented silicone membrane) was proposed by Zodiac. The results of static airbag-deployment tests with conventional and prototype airbags showed a significant reduction of the maximum linear head acceleration and neck bending with airbag prototype when a dual stage inflating was ignited, due to a reduced 'flinging' of the arm."

  "abstract": "Background: Effective treatment for recalcitrant rhinosinusitis requires unobstructed surgical marsupialization of sinus cavities and use of delivery systems that will topically penetrate the sinuses.\nAims: To determine the extent of sinus penetration achieved with nasal irrigation by varying the ostial size and head position.\nMethods: Ten thawed fresh-frozen cadaver heads were dissected in a staged manner. After each stage of dissection, sinus squeeze-bottle irrigations were performed in three head positions, and endoscopes placed via external ports into the sinus cavities viewed the sinus ostia. An ordinal scale was developed to grade ostial penetration of irrigations. Three reviewers independently graded the outcomes.\nResults: Irrigant entry into sinuses increased with ostial size (P < .001) and the greatest differential of improvement in sinus penetration is obtained at an ostial size of 4.7 mm. Stages 2 and 3 (larger sinus ostia) of maxillary and sphenoid dissections have statistically greater irrigant penetration relative to earlier stages. Frontal sinus irrigation is worse in vertex to ceiling head position. There does not appear to be any significant advantage to head position with maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.\nConclusions: This study shows that the larger the sinus ostium, the better the penetration of irrigant into the sinus, with an ostium of at least 4.7 mm allowing maximal penetration in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. The same benefit was not noted in the frontal sinus. Head position was only relevant to the frontal sinus where less penetration was seen with the head neutral (vertex to ceiling) position when compared to forward angled positions."

The diagnoses for mouth breathing included: allergic rhinitis, adenoidal hypertrophy, allergic rhinitis with adenoidal hypertrophy; and/or functional mouth breathing. This study was conducted with on 414 subjects of both genders, from 2 to 16-years old. A team consisting of 3 speech-language pathologists, 1 pediatrician, 1 allergist, and 1 otolaryngologist, evaluated the patients. Multidisciplinary clinical examinations were carried out (complete blood counting, X-rays, nasofibroscopy, audiometry). The two most commonly found etiologies were allergic rhinitis, followed by functional mouth breathing. Of the 414 patients in the study, 346 received a speech-language pathology evaluation. The most prevalent finding in this group of 346 subjects was the presence of orofacial myofunctional disorders. The most frequently orofacial myofunctional disorder identified in these subjects who also presented mouth breathing included: habitual open lips rest posture, low and forward tongue rest posture and lack of adequate muscle tone. There were also no statistically significant relationships identified between etiology and speech-language diagnosis. Therefore, the specific type of etiology of mouth breathing does not appear to contribute to the presence, type, or number of speech-language findings which may result from mouth breathing behavior."

  "title": "The use of the T1 sagittal angle in predicting overall sagittal balance of the spine",
  "date": "2010 Nov",
  "abstract": "Background context: A balanced sagittal alignment of the spine has been shown to strongly correlate with less pain, less disability, and greater health status scores. To restore proper sagittal balance, one must assess the position of the occiput relative to the sacrum. The assessment of spinal balance preoperatively can be challenging, whereas predicting postoperative balance is even more difficult.\nPurpose: This study was designed to evaluate and quantify multiple factors that influence sagittal balance.\nStudy design: Retrospective analysis of existing spinal radiographs.\nMethods: A retrospective review of 52 adult spine patient records was performed. All patients had full-column digital radiographs that showed all the important skeletal landmarks necessary for accurate measurement. The average age of the patient was 53 years. Both genders were equally represented. The radiographs were measured using standard techniques to obtain the following parameters: scoliosis in the coronal plane; lordosis or kyphosis of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine; the T1 sagittal angle (angle between a horizontal line and the superior end plate of T1); the angle of the dens in the sagittal plane; the angle of the dens in relation to the occiput; the sacral slope; the pelvic incidence; the femoral-sacral angle; and finally, the sagittal vertical axis (SVA) measured from both the dens of C2 and from C7.\nResults: It was found that the SVA when measured from the dens was on average 16 mm farther forward than the SVA measured from C7 (p<.0001). The dens plumb line (SVA(dens)) was then used in the study. An analysis was done to examine the relationship between SVA(dens) and each of the other measurements. The T1 sagittal angle was found to have a moderate positive correlation (r=0.65) with SVA(dens), p<.0001, indicating that the amount of sagittal T1 tilt can be used as a good predictor of overall sagittal balance. When examining the other variables, it was found that cervical lordosis had a weak correlation (r=0.37) with SVA(dens) that was unexpected, given that cervical lordosis determines head position. Thoracic kyphosis also had a weak correlation (r=0.26) with SVA(C1), which was equally surprising. Lumbar lordosis had a slightly higher correlation (r=0.38), p=.006, than the cervical or thoracic spine. A multiple regression was run on the data to examine the relationship that all these independent variables have on SVA(dens). SPSS (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to create a regression equation using the independent variables of T1 sagittal angle, cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, sacral slope, pelvic incidence, and femoral-sacral angle and the dependent variable of SVA(dens). The model had a strong correlation (r=0.80, r(2)=0.64) and was statistically significant (p<.0001). The T1 sagittal angle was the variable that had the strongest correlation with the SVA(dens) Spearman r=0.65, p<.0001, followed by pelvic incidence, p=.002, and lumbar lordosis, p=.006. We also observed that when the T1 tilt was higher than 25°, all patients had at least 10 cm of positive sagittal imbalance. In addition, patients with negative sagittal balance had mostly low T1 tilt values, usually lower than 13°. The other variables were not shown to have a statically significant influence on SVA.\nConclusions: This analysis shows that many factors influence the overall sagittal balance of the patient, but it may be the position of the pelvis and lower spine that have a stronger influence than the position of the upper back and neck. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there are no studies to date that have established a normal sagittal T1 tilt angle. However, our analysis has shown that when the T1 tilt was higher than 25°, all patients had at least 10 cm of positive sagittal imbalance. It also showed that patients with negative sagittal balance had mostly low T1 tilt values, usually below 13° of angulation. The T1 sagittal angle is a measurement that may be very useful in evaluating sagittal balance, as it was the measure that most strongly correlated with SVA(dens). It has its great utility where long films cannot be obtained. Patients whose T1 tilt falls outside the range 13° to 25° should be sent for full-column radiographs for a complete evaluation of their sagittal balance. On the other hand, a T1 tilt within the above range does not guarantee a normal sagittal balance, and further investigation should be performed at the surgeon's discretion."

  "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate head and shoulder alignment among patients with unilateral vestibular hypofunction (UVH), using computerized biophotogrammetry (CB) and to correlate these measurements with gender, age, duration of clinical evolution, self-perception of intensity of dizziness and occurrences of falls.\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional study. Thirty individuals with UVH and 30 with normal vestibular function and without complaints of dizziness underwent CB in the anterior, right and left and posterior views, in an upright standing position. Alcimage™ 2.0 was used to evaluate three angles in order to verify the anterior deviation and inclination of the head, and the alignment of the shoulders. The groups were paired according to age, gender and height. The statistical analysis consisted of the Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn test, and the Spearman Correlation Coefficient.\nResults: The patients with UVH had greater forward (55.44 ± 16.33) and lateral (2.03 ± 1.37) head deviation angles than did the normal individuals (34.34 ± 4.60 and 1.34 ± 1.05 respectively), with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). The increment of forward and lateral deviation in the UVH group was 38.05% and 33.78% respectively. Forward head was associated with the duration of clinical symptoms of the vestibular disease (p=0.003), age (p=0.006), intensity of dizziness (p<0.001) and occurrence of falls (p=0.002).\nConclusions: Patients with UVH had greater forward and lateral head deviations. Forward head deviation increased with age, duration of clinical symptoms and greater self-perception of the intensity of dizziness. Forward head deviation was also greater among patients who reported having had falls."

  "date": "2010 Aug",
  "abstract": "Aim: Forward flexibility of the trunk (FFT) is used as an indicator of vertebral function and assessed using the sit-and-reach and fingertip-ground tests.\nMethods: FFT was investigated in adolescents and comparisons were made among genders, sitting and standing positions, and low and high speed; 102 males and females (16 to 20 years of age) participated in the study.\nResults: The position of the body and gender factor had no influence over the flexibility assessment. When executed slowly, the values obtained in the test were significantly lower; 60% of the participants were unable to reach their feet in the slow form and 50% were unable to reach their feet in the fast form. Thus, the assessment of vertebral function in adolescents should not use the ability to reach their feet as a criterion of normality. The fingertip-ground and sit-and-reach tests proved to be equally adequate. Greater height and length of limbs are associated to lower FFT values. Greater height and lower trunk-head height explain the lesser FFT in women; greater length of the lower limbs and lesser arm span explain the results for men.\nConclusions: Reaching the feet in either the standing or sitting position is a criterion that excludes approximately 50% of adolescents from the normality of vertebral function, whereas reaching 12 cm above the ground is achieved by 90% of the population. Therefore, the criteria for assessing FFT in adolescents need to be reviewed."

These headache types can be differentiated based on strict clinical definitions that depend on the patient's signs and symptoms. However, some of the clinical features can overlap, and in addition, the same comorbid conditions can occur in both headache types. Distinction between these headache types on occasion can be difficult due to comorbid conditions such as temporomandibular joint disorders and myofascial pain with forward head posturing, which may be present in both headache disorders, and thus result in similar features in both conditions. Furthermore, chronification, particularly of migraine, leads to a decrease in the associated symptoms of migraine, such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, so that these headaches more closely resemble tension-type headache. Finally, in some patients, both tension-type headache and migraine may occur at different times."

  "abstract": "We assessed the effects of forward head posture in the sitting position on the activity of the scapular upward rotators during loaded isometric shoulder flexion in the sagittal plane. Healthy volunteers (n = 21; 11 men, 10 women) with no history of pathology participated in the study. Subjects were instructed to perform isometric shoulder flexion with the right upper extremity in both the forward head posture (FHP) and neutral head posture (NHP) while sitting. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles. Dependent variables were examined by 2 (posture)×3 (muscle) repeated measures analysis of variance. Significantly increased EMG activity in the upper trapezius and lower trapezius and significantly decreased EMG activity in the serratus anterior were found during loaded isometric shoulder flexion with FHP. Thus, FHP may contribute to work-related neck and shoulder pain during loaded shoulder flexion while sitting. These results suggest that maintaining NHP is advantageous in reducing sustained upper and lower trapezius activity and enhancing serratus anterior activity as compared with FHP during loaded shoulder flexion."

  "abstract": "Previous studies showed that highly hypnotizable persons imagining a specific sensory context behave according to the corresponding real stimulation and perceive their behaviour as involuntary. The aim of the study was to confirm the hypothesis of a translation of sensory imagery into real perception and, thus, of a true involuntary response. We studied the imagery-induced modulation of the vestibulospinal (VS) reflex earlier component in highly (Highs) and low hypnotizable subjects (Lows), as it is not affected by voluntary control, its amplitude depends on the stimulus intensity, and the plane of body sway depends on the position of the head with respect to the trunk. Results showed that the effects of the \"obstructive\" imagery of anaesthesia are different from those elicited by the \"constructive\" imagery of head rotation. Indeed, both Highs and Lows having their face forward and reporting high vividness of imagery experienced anaesthesia and reduced their VS reflex amplitude in the frontal plane, while only Highs changed the plane of body sway according to the imagined head rotation that is from the frontal to the sagittal one. These effects cannot be voluntary and should be attributed to translation of sensory imagery into the corresponding real perception."

  "date": "2010 Oct",
  "abstract": "It was proposed to investigate whether the central nervous system is able to select the most appropriate reference frame for controlling subjects' vertical orientation in response to severe environmental constraints such as microgravity and support perturbations. The question addressed was whether the subjects, regardless of their perceptual typology, might be able to use the same visual reference frame to control their vertical orientation. Fifteen subjects were asked to perform a sit-to-stand (STS) task under microgravity. Subjects were seated on a chair with their feet fixed to a horizontal or forwards tilted support (20°). When the support was tilted the subjects' ankles were placed at an angle of 110°. Two main findings emerged from this study. First, in all the experimental conditions, the results obtained showed that the subjects' controlled their postural orientation fairly correctly but not very precisely, since a bias was systematically observed in their head and trunk orientation. In other words, changes in their ankle angles and the absence of gravity only slightly disturbed their vertical body orientation, and when these two constraints were applied concomitantly, their effects were not cumulative. Secondly, contrary to our initial hypothesis, the subjects' postural orientation performances were not correlated with the perceptual typology. All the subjects preferentially used the visual reference frame to control their vertical postural orientation. The present findings confirm that the proprioceptive dominance of visual independent (VI) subjects enhances their ability to select the most appropriate reference frame to deal with inter-sensory disturbances such as those consisting here of microgravity combined with proprioceptive perturbations imposed at ankle level."

  "date": "2011 Apr",
  "abstract": "Changing the foot position modifies the mechanical action exerted by the ankle extensor and flexor muscles over the body. We verified, in two groups of healthy subjects standing with the heels touching or apart, whether a 90° external rotation of the right leg and foot also changes the pattern of vestibulospinal reflexes elicited by electrical stimulation of the labyrinth. With the head oriented forward, leg rotation did not modify the labyrinthine-driven displacements of the center of pressure (CoP). When the head was rotated in the horizontal plane, either to the right or to the left, the CoP displacement increased along the y axis in all subjects. Changes in the x component in most instances appropriate to preserve unmodified the direction of body sway elicited by the stimulus were observed. Right leg rotation increased the basal EMG activity of ankle extensors and flexors on the left side, while the right side activity was unaffected. The EMG responses to labyrinthine stimulation were modified only on the left side, in a way appropriate to correct the effects of the altered torque pattern exerted on the body by right leg muscles. It appears, therefore, that somatosensory signals related to leg rotation and/or copy of the corresponding voluntary motor commands modify the pattern of vestibulospinal reflexes and maintain the postural response appropriate to counteract a body sway in the direction inferred by labyrinthine signals."

  "date": "2010 Oct 30",
  "abstract": "Changes in stride characteristics and gait rhythmicity characterize gait in Parkinson's disease and are widely believed to contribute to falls in this population. However, few studies have examined gait in PD patients who fall. This study reports on the complexities of walking in PD patients who reported falling during a 12-month follow-up. Forty-nine patients clinically diagnosed with idiopathic PD and 34 controls had their gait assessed using three-dimensional motion analysis. Of the PD patients, 32 (65%) reported at least one fall during the follow-up compared with 17 (50%) controls. The results showed that PD patients had increased stride timing variability, reduced arm swing and walked with a more stooped posture than controls. Additionally, PD fallers took shorter strides, walked slower, spent more time in double-support, had poorer gait stability ratios and did not project their center of mass as far forward of their base of support when compared with controls. These stride changes were accompanied by a reduced range of angular motion for the hip and knee joints. Relative to walking velocity, PD fallers had increased mediolateral head motion compared with PD nonfallers and controls. Therefore, head motion could exceed \"normal\" limits, if patients increased their walking speed to match healthy individuals. This could be a limiting factor for improving gait in PD and emphasizes the importance of clinically assessing gait to facilitate the early identification of PD patients with a higher risk of falling."

  "title": "The influence of cranio-cervical posture on maximal mouth opening and pressure pain threshold in patients with myofascial temporomandibular pain disorders",
  "date": "2011 Jan",
  "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the influence of cranio-cervical posture on the maximal mouth opening (MMO) and pressure pain threshold (PPT) in patients with myofascial temporomandibular pain disorders.\nMaterials and methods: A total of 29 patients (19 females and 10 males) with myofascial temporomandibular pain disorders, aged 19 to 59 years participated in the study (mean years±SD; 34.69±10.83 y). MMO and the PPT (on the right side) of patients in neutral, retracted, and forward head postures were measured. A 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by 3 pair-wise comparisons were used to determine differences.\nResults: Comparisons indicated significant differences in PPT at 3 points within the trigeminal innervated musculature [masseter (M1 and M2) and anterior temporalis (T1)] among the 3 head postures [M1 (F=117.78; P<0.001), M2 (F=129.04; P<0.001), and T1 (F=195.44; P<0.001)]. There were also significant differences in MMO among the 3 head postures (F=208.06; P<0.001). The intrarater reliability on a given day-to-day basis was good with the interclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.89 to 0.94 and 0.92 to 0.94 for PPT and MMO, respectively, among the different head postures.\nConclusions: The results of this study shows that the experimental induction of different cranio-cervical postures influences the MMO and PPT values of the temporomandibular joint and muscles of mastication that receive motor and sensory innervation by the trigeminal nerve. Our results provide data that supports the biomechanical relationship between the cranio-cervical region and the dynamics of the temporomandibular joint, as well as trigeminal nociceptive processing in different cranio-cervical postures."

  "title": "Updating process of internal model of action as assessed from motor and postural strategies in young adults",
  "date": "2011 Apr",
  "abstract": "Internal models are constantly updated based on the actions and experiences of a person in the world. In the present study, we proposed to assess the updating process of internal models of action by providing new environmental constraints for motor planning, postural control, and execution processes in daily tasks such as STS and BTS. STS and BTS tasks were performed with different inclinations of the support surface on which the participant and the chair were positioned: horizontal support, support tilted 10° to the right, or forward. Twelve healthy adults participated in this experiment. Kinematic characteristics were recorded using an optoelectronic motion analysis system. Movement duration and trunk inclination amplitudes were analyzed for STS and BTS as well as trunk orientation and strategies of head stabilization. Concerning the movement analysis our results showed (1) temporal asymmetry between STS and BTS, attributed mainly to the integration of the mechanical effects of gravity, and (2) a decrease of trunk movements when the support was tilted forward, attesting to an immediate adaptation process. Concerning the postural analysis our study revealed that adults adopted selective head stabilization on space strategy with respect to balance constraints. To conclude, young adults were able to immediately update their internal model of action in order to optimize motor control and vertical body orientation."

In research, HP is characterised through the measurement of angles and distances between anatomical landmarks. This study investigated whether the assessment of HP as performed in clinical practice is reliable and valid. Ten physiotherapists assessed forward HP, head extension and side-flexion from images of 40 individuals with and without previous experience of neck pain using a four-category scale. The assessment was repeated twice with a 1-week gap. Physiotherapists' ratings were then compared with angular measurements of the same components of HP. K values for intra-rater reliability varied between 0.22 and 0.81 for forward HP, between 0.19 and 0.69 for head extension and between 0.38 and 0.67 for side-flexion. K values for inter-rater reliability were 0.02 for forward HP, 0.07 for head extension and 0.19 for side-flexion. Correlation coefficients between the ratings and the angular measurements varied between -0.16 and -0.49 for forward HP, between -0.17 and 0.68 for head extension and between -0.04 and 0.37 for side-flexion. The assessment of HP by observation and a four-category scale showed poor reliability and validity."

  "abstract": "Introduction: Astronauts face transient disruptions of sensorimotor functions after spaceflight. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) testing has been used to document functional recovery; however, its objective value in return-to-duty decision-making has not been established. Therefore, we studied the diagnostic accuracy of CDP to determine the most effective test components for probing post-spaceflight sensorimotor deficits.\nMethods: There were 11 first-time astronauts and 11 matched controls who were evaluated by CDP before and after spaceflight (controls did not fly). All CDP testing was conducted with eyes closed while standing on a computer-controlled force plate. Somatosensory influences were either unperturbed (stationary force plate) or altered (unstable force plate), and vestibular influences were either unperturbed (head erect) or altered by static (head pitched forward or back by 200) or dynamic (head pitched voluntarily in cadence with an auditory signal: +/- 20 degrees at 0.33 Hz) challenges. Using equilibrium (EQ) scores derived from peak A-P sway as the dependent measure, we determined the sensitivity and specificity of each test condition and then constructed receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves to determine their diagnostic accuracies.\nResults: The greatest diagnostic accuracy was obtained from the test requiring the subject to make dynamic head movements while standing on an unstable force plate (94.9% sensitivity 96.6% specificity, area under ROC curve = 0.991). By contrast, the estimated ROC area for the standard clinical Romberg test (fixed support, head erect), which is often used to make postflight return-to-duty decisions, was 0.718.\nConclusion: We recommend that results from this test paradigm be considered during postflight return-to-duty decision-making."

The significance of differences in the seat supports (hard, spongy, unstable) was tested by repeated one-way ANOVA with the significance cutoff set at alpha = 0.05.\nResults: Computer work seated on an unstable cushion-ball as compared to a spongy soft-cushion seat support showed significantly lower midcervical and L5 paraspinal muscle activity and significantly higher lower trapezius and internal oblique abdominal muscle activity. The mean forward head angle decreased in the order of spongy, hard, and unstable seat supports.\nConclusions: An unstable cushion-ball seat support may prevent work-related neck and upper limb disorders associated with forward head posture."

  "date": "2010 Jun",
  "abstract": "Individualised head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) have been shown to accurately simulate forward and backward directional sounds. This study explores directional simulation for non-individualised HRTFs by determining orthogonal HRTFs for listeners to choose between. Using spectral features previously shown to aid forward-backward differentiation, 196 non-individualised HRTFs were clustered into six orthogonal groups and the centre HRTF of each group was selected as representative. An experiment with 15 listeners was conducted to evaluate the benefits of choosing between six centre-front and six centre-back directional sounds rather than the single front/back sounds produced by MIT-KEMAR HRTFs. Sound localisation error was significantly reduced by 22% and 65% of listeners reduced their front-back confusion rates. The significant reduction was maintained when the number of HRTFs was reduced from six to five. This represents a preliminary success in bridging the gap between individual and non-individual HRTFs for applications such as spatial surround sound systems. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: Due to different pinna shapes, directional sound stimuli generated by non-individualised HRTFs suffer from serious front-back confusion. The reported work demonstrates a way to reduce front-back confusion for centre-back sounds generated from non-individualised HRTFs."

The programme relied on microswitch sensors to monitor the response and turn on preferred stimuli following response occurrences. The programme was assessed via an ABAB design.\nResults: Data showed that the man had significant increases in response frequencies during the intervention phases of the study with multiple occasions of stimulation access and head raising.\nConclusion: Technology-assisted programmes may represent a useful strategy for providing post-coma persons with multiple disabilities an active (self-control) role."

  "abstract": "Study design: A repeated measures observational study.\nObjective: To investigate change in sagittal alignment of head and neck posture in response to adjustments of an office chair with and without a lumbar roll in situ.\nSummary of background data: Forward head posture has been identified as a risk factor for neck pain, and there is evidence to show that ergonomic correction in sitting may reduce the incidence of pain. The effect placement of a lumbar roll has on cervical spine posture has not been previously investigated experimentally but rather, is assumed to have a positive influence on head and neck posture.\nMethods: Thirty healthy male participants (18-30 years) were photographed while registered in the natural head resting position in each of 4 sitting positions with and without a lumbar roll in situ. Two positions incorporated adjustments to the back rest and 1 to the seat pan of the office chair. The craniovertebral (CV) angle, as a determinant of head and neck posture was measured from the set of digitized photographs obtained for each participant. Comparisons between the CV angle in all postural registrations were made using a mixed model analysis adjusted for multiple comparisons.\nResults: Of the positions examined, significant differences in the mean CV angles were found with the backrest of the chair at 100 degrees and at 110 degrees (P < 0.001). With the lumbar roll in situ and the backrest position at 110 degrees , there was a significant increase in the mean CV compared with the angle without the lumbar roll in situ (2.32 degrees , 95% confidence interval: 1.31-3.33; P < 0.001).\nConclusion: The degree of angulation of the backrest support of an office chair plus the addition of lumbar roll support are the 2 most important factors to be taken into account when considering seating factors likely to favorably change head and neck postural alignment, at least in asymptomatic subjects."

Posture, strength and shoulder pain and function were assessed. Forward head angle was measured using a digital inclinometer, forward head translation was measured using a ruler and total scapular distance was measured with unmarked string. Average and peak values (N) of strength were measured with the hand-held dynamometer. The intervention subjects then participated in an 8-week exercise training programme to correct posture. The procedures were then repeated in the post-test.\nResults: Significant group by time interactions (p<0.05) were found in forward head angle and forward shoulder translation indicating a decrease in forward head angle and forward shoulder translation. Significant main effects for time (p<0.05) were found in strength measures for all muscle groups indicating increased strength for shoulder girdle muscles tested.\nConclusions: The exercise intervention was successful at decreasing forward head and rounded shoulder postures in elite swimmers. This study supports the theoretical basis for clinical rehabilitation of posture and the shoulder."

  "date": "2010 Feb",
  "abstract": "Rationale, aims and objectives: Historically, clinicians visually evaluate posture using anatomical landmarks. Advances in technology made digital photographs now feasible to use in clinical practice. Photogrammetry may increase the reliability of the assessment of postural changes. However, differences between visually estimated and photogrammetric recorded changes in posture need to be tested. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of visual assessments of changes in head posture in the sagittal plane in relation to photogrammetric recorded data.\nMethods: The head posture of 29 female subjects in a sagittal plane was assessed visually and photogrammetrically. The visual assessment of head posture was conducted using a postural grid with a plumb for checking the alignment. The patients were classified as having forward head posture (FHP), slight FHP or no FHP. Photogrammetry of head posture was performed using the Alcimage software (Alcimar B. Soares, Uberlândia, MG, Brasil). Three reference points were used to measure the head posture angle: mentus, external auditory meatus and manubrium. The visually classified groups were compared in relation to the photogrammetric angles using one-way ANOVA.\nResults: A significant difference was found between the FHP and no FHP groups (P = 0.001), and between the FHP and slight FHP groups (P = 0.002). However, no significant difference was found between the slight FHP and no FHP groups.\nConclusions: Visual assessments of sagittal head posture were sensitive to detect differences between no FHP and FHP groups, but were not sensitive to detect differences between no FHP and slight FHP groups. Head posture photogrammetry is recommended to quantitatively detect less evident differences in head posture."

  "abstract": "Protection of children in Child Safety Seats (CSS) in side impact crashes has been a topic of recent studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of CSS in far-side impacts through a series of sled tests conducted at varying test speeds. Forty eight sled tests were conducted at three speeds (24 km/h, 29 km/h and 36 km/h), under two different CSS attachment conditions (LATCH and seat belt attached), using rear facing and forward facing CSS from four different manufacturers. Analyses were conducted to examine head retention within the CSS, velocity of the head as it passes an imaginary plane (cross over into other occupant space or door), lateral trajectory of the head and knee; head, chest and pelvis accelerations; neck and lumbar loads and moments. In addition to these parameters, the CSS were visually inspected for structural integrity after each test. Results from these sled tests highlighted the differential performance of CSS in far-side impacts. During the tests, all CSS experienced significant lateral movement irrespective of attachment type. In rear facing CSS tests, one of the designs failed as the seat disengaged from its base. In forward facing CSS tests, it was observed that the seat belt attached CSS experienced less rotational motion than the LATCH attached CSS. ATD head retention within the seat was not achieved with either CSS attachments at any speed. The findings from this study augment the current efforts to define regulatory sled setup procedure for far-side impact crashes involving children in CSS, which currently does not exist and will eventually further the protection of children in automobiles."

  "title": "The effect of obesity on the restraint of automobile occupants",
  "date": "2009 Oct",
  "abstract": "As obesity rates increase, the protection of obese occupants will become increasingly important in vehicle and restraint design. As a first step in this effort, this study seeks to compare the kinematics, dynamics, and injuries of obese post mortem human surrogates (PMHS) to (approximately) 50(th) percentile adult male PMHS in frontal impact sled tests with a force-limiting, pre-tensioning restraint system. Forty-eight km/h, frontal impact sled tests were performed with a sled buck representing the rear seat occupant compartment of a 2004 mid-sized sedan. The restraint system consisted of a 3-point belt with a pretensioner and a progressive force-limiter at the retractor. The test subjects were either obese PMHS or approximately 50(th) percentile adult male PMHS. Instrumentation included accelerometer packages on the spine. Deformation of the subjects' chests were measured using chestbands placed nominally at the superior-inferior locations of the 4(th) and 8(th) ribs. Tension in the restraint system was measured at the upper shoulder belt, lower shoulder belt, and the lap belt. Motion of the head, shoulder, pelvis, and knee were recorded using high-speed video. Two obese PMHS (average mass 137 kg, average stature 186 cm) and three approximately mid-sized male PMHS (average mass 68 kg, average stature 176 cm) were tested. The obese PMHS exhibited significantly greater forward motion of the head and the pelvis compared to the mid-sized PMHS. The obese PMHS also exhibited backwards torso rotation at the time of maximum forward excursion, whereas the mid-sized PMHS did not. The obese PMHS exhibited average maximum chest compressions of approximately 44% (+/- 9% standard deviation) of their initial chest depths, and exhibited 26 g (+/- 2 g) average 3 ms clip maximum chest resultant acceleration. In comparison, the mid-sized PMHS exhibited averages of 29% (+/- 9%) maximum chest compression and 35 g (+/- 4 g) maximum 3 ms clip chest acceleration. The obese PMHS exhibited 7 and 2 rib fractures, with maximum chest AIS scores of 3 and 2. The mid-sized PMHS exhibited 12, 2, and 17 rib fractures, with maximum chest AIS scores of 4, 1, and 4, respectively. This study is the first (to the authors' knowledge) to compare the kinematic, dynamic, and injury behaviors of obese and mid-sized PMHS in frontal impact sled tests with a force-limiting, pretensioning restraint system. The unfavorable kinematics observed with the obese PMHS highlights the difficulty of designing restraint systems to adequately restrain obese occupants, even with currently available advanced restraint technologies."

The aim of the study was to find out whether locomotion is also less affected in highs than in lows by visual suppression and changes in the neck proprioceptive input. Eighteen highs and 20 lows were asked to walk straight ahead, blindfolded, in basal conditions (face forward), during real and imagined right/left head rotation and mental computation. Highs detected deviations from the straight trajectory better than lows. Their walking direction was more straight during basal conditions and less influenced than the lows' one by mental computation and real/imagined rotation of the head. The results confirm highs' lower dependence on sensory inputs, although this cannot be definitely attributed to a better internal representation of space or to higher behavioral automaticity."

  "date": "2010 Apr",
  "abstract": "What are the differences in mechanics, muscle, and motor cortex activity between accurate and nonaccurate movements? We addressed this question in relation to walking. We assessed full-body mechanics (229 variables), activity of 8 limb muscles, and activity of 63 neurons from the motor cortex forelimb representation during well-trained locomotion with different demands on the accuracy of paw placement in cats: during locomotion on a continuous surface and along horizontal ladders with crosspieces of different widths. We found that with increasing accuracy demands, cats assumed a more bent-forward posture (by lowering the center of mass, rotating the neck and head down, and by increasing flexion of the distal joints) and stepped on the support surface with less spatial variability. On the ladder, the wrist flexion moment was lower throughout stance, whereas ankle and knee extension moments were higher and hip moment was lower during early stance compared with unconstrained locomotion. The horizontal velocity time histories of paws were symmetric and smooth and did not differ among the tasks. Most of the other mechanical variables also did not depend on accuracy demands. Selected distal muscles slightly enhanced their activity with increasing accuracy demands. However, in a majority of motor cortex cells, discharge rate means, peaks, and depths of stride-related frequency modulation changed dramatically during accurate stepping as compared with simple walking. In addition, in 30% of neurons periods of stride-related elevation in firing became shorter and in 20-25% of neurons activity or depth of frequency modulation increased, albeit not linearly, with increasing accuracy demands. Considering the relatively small changes in locomotor mechanics and substantial changes in motor cortex activity with increasing accuracy demands, we conclude that during practiced accurate stepping the activity of motor cortex reflects other processes, likely those that involve integration of visual information with ongoing locomotion."

  "date": "2010 May",
  "abstract": "We investigated the possible consequences of two consecutive postural tasks on adaptation. Four groups (total number of 46 healthy subjects) were perturbed on two consecutive days with vibration stimulus to tibialis anterior or posterior calf muscles, or both in different orders. Postural movements were recorded with a force platform. There were three major results: (1) tibialis anterior vibration instigated postural adaptation during exposure to the vibration, but did not induce long-term adaptation from day to day, contrary to posterior calf vibration. (2) The long-term postural adaptation from day to day when the posterior calf was vibrated was not affected by prior or subsequent tibialis anterior vibration, which contrasts to other studies on motor learning. (3) Exposure to posterior calf vibration prior tibialis anterior vibration, led to changes of postural strategies and larger amount of torque variance, implying that postural strategies initiated by the gastrocnemius vibration were re-employed during the subsequent tibialis anterior stimulation. This may represent the formation of an internal model, used as feed-forward control of posture, possibly consisting of sensory reweighting. Postural perturbations need to be sufficiently difficult to withstand, in order to induce long-term learning, and postural strategies may be transferred between different postural challenges if they post different demands. Clinically, this suggests that exercises designed to rehabilitate patients should be sufficiently challenging to instigate learning processes, and spaced in order to avoid development of inappropriate postural strategies."

  "date": "2010 Aug",
  "abstract": "Forward head and rounded shoulder posture (FHRSP) is theorized to contribute to alterations in scapular kinematics and muscle activity leading to the development of shoulder pain. However, reported differences in scapular kinematics and muscle activity in those with forward head and rounded shoulder posture are confounded by the presence of shoulder pain. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare scapular kinematics and muscle activity in individuals free from shoulder pain, with and without FHRSP. Eighty volunteers were classified as having FHRSP or ideal posture. Scapular kinematics were collected concurrently with muscle activity from the upper and lower trapezius as well as the serratus anterior muscles during a loaded flexion and overhead reaching task using an electromagnetic tracking system and surface electromyography. Separate mixed model analyses of variance were used to compare three-dimensional scapular kinematics and muscle activity during the ascending phases of both tasks. Individuals with FHRSP displayed significantly greater scapular internal rotation with less serratus anterior activity, during both tasks as well as greater scapular upward rotation, anterior tilting during the flexion task when compared with the ideal posture group. These results provide support for the clinical hypothesis that FHRSP impacts shoulder mechanics independent of shoulder pain."

  "abstract": "Human faces show marked sexual shape dimorphism, and this affects their attractiveness. Humans also show marked height dimorphism, which means that men typically view women's faces from slightly above and women typically view men's faces from slightly below. We tested the idea that this perspective difference may be the evolutionary origin of the face shape dimorphism by having males and females rate the masculinity/femininity and attractiveness of male and female faces that had been manipulated in pitch (forward or backward tilt), simulating viewing the face from slightly above or below. As predicted, tilting female faces upwards decreased their perceived femininity and attractiveness, whereas tilting them downwards increased their perceived femininity and attractiveness. Male faces tilted up were judged to be more masculine, and tilted down judged to be less masculine. This suggests that sexual selection may have embodied this viewpoint difference into the actual facial proportions of men and women."

  "abstract": "Study design: A cross-sectional study to examine the sagittal kinematics of spine and lower limb movement during sit-to-stand (STS).\nObjective: To describe the sagittal kinematics of the spine and lower limb in healthy older adults during STS from 2 seat heights.\nSummary of background data: Older adults with age-related changes in the neuromusculoskeletal system are likely to have difficulty in STS. However, little is known about movement of the spinal regions and their interaction with the lower limb during STS, and the effect of seat height.\nMethods: Thirty-two healthy older adults aged over 60 years were videotaped performing STS from 2 seat heights. A 2-dimensional video motion analysis system with a revised sagittal model was used to measure angular displacement and velocity for the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine, and the lower limb joints.\nResults: Concurrent flexion in the hip joint and lumbar spine was accompanied by extension in the thoracic, lower, and upper cervical spine as the trunk leaned forward. After the buttocks lifted off (LO) the chair, the movement interaction in the spine and hip joint was reversed. Some significant age-related changes during STS included downward head tilt at LO, decreased lumbar range of motion, and a large between-participant variation in the movement ratios. Statistically significant differences in the temporal parameters, angular displacement, and velocity were also found when standing from a lower chair.\nConclusion: This study provides a detailed description of STS in healthy older adults, which has implications for rehabilitation of elderly patients who have difficulty with this activity. Clinicians need to be aware of the concurrent contribution of the hip joint and lumbar spine to trunk forward lean, the importance of thoracic extension during the pre-LO phase and the downward gaze at LO in healthy older adults."

  "date": "2010 Apr 15",
  "abstract": "Extreme forward flexion of the spine, named camptocormia (CC), and head drop syndrome (HD) may be among the most disabling symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aims to eludicate the etiology of PD-associated CC and HD via a multidisciplinary approach (clinical examination, electromyography, MRI, genetic analysis, muscle morphology) centering on the histology of the paraspinal muscles. We studied 17 patients with the clinical diagnosis of PD and CC or head drop syndrome and six controls. We performed muscle biopsies of paraspinal muscles and deep neck extensor muscles. Mean age at onset of postural abnormality was 66 years and mean latency between onset of parkinsonian symptoms to first signs of CC or head drop was 7 years. The electromyogram of paraspinal muscles was abnormal in 13-14 patients. Histopathology revealed chronic myopathic changes in 14 of 17 biopsies, consisting of abnormal variation in fiber size, increase in internal nuclei, and increase in connective tissue, myofibrillar disarray and similarities to protein surplus myopathies. Interestingly, heterozygous variants in the Parkin gene were found in 2 of 9 investigated patients. We conclude that CC and HD in PD are predominantly myopathic. Aberrant protein aggregation may link PD and CC."

  "title": "Dysphagia in spinal muscular atrophy type II: more than a bulbar problem?",
  "date": "2009 Nov 24",
  "abstract": "Objective: In patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type II, feeding problems and dysphagia are common, but the underlying mechanisms of these problems are not well defined. This case control study was designed to determine the underlying mechanisms of dysphagia in SMA type II.\nMethods: Six children with SMA type II and 6 healthy matched controls between 6.4 and 13.4 years of age were investigated during swallowing liquid and solid food in 2 different postures using surface EMG (sEMG) of the submental muscle group (SMG) and a video fluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS).\nResults: The VFSS showed postswallow residue of solid food in the vallecula and above the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), which can be responsible for indirect aspiration. Better results in swallowing were achieved in a more forward head position. These findings were supported by the sEMG measurements of the SMG during swallowing.\nConclusions: Dysphagia in spinal muscular atrophy type II is due to a neurologic dysfunction (lower motor neuron problems from the cranial nerves in the brainstem) influencing the muscle force and efficiency of movement of the tongue and the submental muscle group in combination with a biomechanical component (compensatory head posture). The results suggest an integrated treatment with an adapted posture during meals and the advice of drinking water after meals to prevent aspiration pneumonias."

  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to verify possible relationships between global body posture and temporomandibular joint internal derangement (TMJ-id), by comparing 30 subjects presenting typical TMJ-id signs to 20 healthy subjects. Body posture was assessed using the analysis of muscle chains on several photographs. Results show a higher frequency of lifted shoulders (p=0.04) and of changes in the antero-internal hip chain (p=0.02) in the test group, but no further differences were found significant between the control and test groups. The test group was then divided into three subgroups according to the Helkimo index of temporomandibular disorder severity. Again, no significant differences were found between the subgroups. However, there was a trend noticed in the group with the most severe dysfunction, to present a forward head and shoulders posture. Results are discussed in light of previous studies using the same sample."

  "title": "Age differences in energy absorption in the upper extremity during a descent movement: implications for arresting a fall",
  "date": "2010 Mar",
  "abstract": "Background: Falls are the number one cause of unintentional injury in older adults. The protective response of \"breaking the fall\" with the outstretched hand is often essential for avoiding injury to the hip and head. In this study, we compared the ability of young and older women to absorb the impact energy of a fall in the outstretched arms.\nMethods: Twenty young (mean age = 21 years) and 20 older (M = 78 years) women were instructed to slowly lower their body weight, similar to the descent phase of a push-up, from body lean angles ranging from 15 degrees to 90 degrees . Measures were acquired of peak upper extremity energy absorption, arm deflection, and hand contact force.\nResults: On average, older women were able to absorb 45% less energy in the dominant arm than young women (1.7 +/- 0.5% vs 3.1 +/- 0.4% of their body weight x body height; p < .001). These results suggest that, even when both arms participate equally, the average energy content of a forward fall exceeds by 5-fold the average energy that our older participants could absorb and exceeds by 2.7-fold the average energy that young participants could absorb.\nConclusions: During a descent movement that simulates fall arrest, the energy-absorbing capacity of the upper extremities in older women is nearly half that of young women. Absorbing the full energy of a fall in the upper extremities is a challenging task even for healthy young women. Strengthening of upper extremity muscles should enhance this ability and presumably reduce the risk for injury to the hip and head during a fall."

  "date": "2009",
  "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this research was to describe the variability of forward head posture in healthy older women, and to investigate the influence of age on variability.\nMethods: This cross-sectional descriptive study included 187 healthy community-dwelling women volunteers ranging in age from 65-96 years. The forward head posture (FHP) measurement was derived from a sagittal photograph. The subjects were asked to perform a series of standing activities, and the photograph was taken while the subjects were performing these activities. Data analysis included descriptive analysis, FHP measurement analysis for normalcy, one-factor ANOVA with FHP by age group, post-hoc Tukey analysis, and trend analysis for the age-FHP relationship.\nResults: Three age-group normative FHP means were identified: 48.84 degrees (SE 0.97) for the 65-74 year old group, 41.20 degrees (SE 0.78) for the 75-84 year old group, and 35.60 degrees (SE 1.76) for the 85+ year group. Significant differences were found in the FHP between these age groups. A subsequent trend analysis demonstrated a linear relationship between age and the FHP, with older women demonstrating a more severe FHP.\nConclusions: Age-associated variability in the FHP of healthy elderly women has been identified. The FHP values determined by this research may serve as normative guidelines for clinicians when conducting postural assessments, and in clinical decision-making regarding possible interventions."

  "abstract": "Objective: To identify if there were differences in the cervical biomechanics in preadolescents who had recurrent neck pain and/or headaches and those who did not.\nMethods: A controlled comparison study with a convenience sample of 131 students (10-13 years old) was performed. A questionnaire placed students in the no pain group or in the neck pain/headache group. A physical examination was performed by a doctor of chiropractic to establish head posture, active cervical rotation, passive cervical joint functioning, and muscle impairment. The unpaired t test and the chi(2) test were used to test for differences between the 2 groups, and data were analyzed using SPSS 15 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).\nResults: Forty percent of the children (n = 52) reported neck pain and/or recurrent headache. Neck pain and/or headache were not associated with forward head posture, impaired functioning in cervical paraspinal muscles, and joint dysfunction in the upper and middle cervical spine in these subjects. However, joint dysfunction in the lower cervical spine was significantly associated with neck pain and/or headache in these preadolescents. Most of the students had nonsymptomatic biomechanical dysfunction of the upper cervical spine. There was a wide variation between parental report and the child's self-report of trauma history and neck pain and/or headache prevalence.\nConclusion: In this study, the physical examination findings between preadolescents with neck pain and/or headaches and those who were symptom free differed significantly in one of the parameters measured. Cervical joint dysfunction was a significant finding among those preadolescents complaining of neck pain and/or headache as compared to those who did not."

  "date": "2009 Dec 7",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether changes in eye temperature, measured using infrared thermography (IRT), and heart rate variability (HRV) can detect moderate levels of pain in sheep. Six ewes received the following treatments: 1) noxious ischaemic stimulus by application of a forelimb tourniquet (S), 2) noxious ischaemic stimulus and flunixin meglumine (S+F), and 3) flunixin meglumine (F). Maximum eye temperature, HRV, mechanical nociceptive threshold, blood pressure and behaviour were recorded for up to 60 min, including 15 min of baseline, 30 min during intervention and 15 min post-intervention. There was a tendency towards a decrease in the heart rate variability parameters RMSSD (the root mean square of successive R-R intervals) and SDNN (the standard deviation of all interbeat intervals) in treatment S compared to treatment F, and a significant increase in the same parameters between test day 1 and 3. A reduction in eye temperature was detected for all treatments during intervention, but no difference was found between S and F and S+N and F during intervention. The eye temperature decreased more in test day 2 and 3 compared to test day 1 during intervention. A significant reduction for both lip licking and vocalisation was observed between test day 1 and 3, and forward facing ears was the ear posture most frequently recorded in test day 1. We suggest that HRV is a sensitive, non-invasive method to assess mild to moderate pain in sheep, whereas IRT is a less sensitive method."

  "date": "2009 Oct 7",
  "abstract": "Background: A common but debated technique in the management of swallowing difficulties is the chin tuck swallow, where the neck is flexed forward prior to swallowing. Natural variations in chin tuck angles across individuals may contribute to the differential effectiveness of the technique.\nMethodology: To facilitate the study of chin tuck angle variations, we present a template tracking algorithm that automatically extracts neck angles from sagittal videos of individuals performing chin tuck swallows. Three yellow markers geometrically arranged on a pair of dark visors were used as tracking cues.\nResults: The algorithm was applied to data collected from 178 healthy participants during neutral and chin tuck position swallows. Our analyses revealed no major influences of body mass index and age on neck flexion angles during swallowing, while gender influenced the average neck angle only during wet swallows in the neutral position. Chin tuck angles seem to be independent of anthropometry and gender in healthy adults, but deserve further study in pathological populations.\nConclusion: The proposed neck flexion angle extraction algorithm may be useful in future studies where strict participant compliance to swallowing task protocol can be assured."

  "title": "The measurement of craniocervical posture: a simple method to evaluate head position",
  "date": "2009 Dec",
  "abstract": "Objective: Some studies have correlated craniocervical posture (CCP) with pharyngeal airway space diameter, breathing conditions, neck pain, headache, dentofacial structures and temporomandibular disorders. Several methods have been suggested in an attempt to establish the best way of evaluating head position using teleradiographs and cephalometric analysis. The objectives of this study therefore were to describe a method of measuring the natural head position (NHP) without exposure to radiation or fixture of the cephalostat, and then to test whether there might be a simple method of reproducing this position in the cephalostat to make lateral cephalograms in the study of CCP.\nMethods: The sample consisted of 50 healthy children (28 females and 22 males with a mean age of 10.9+/-4.9 years). Each subject was asked to place their feet in a standardized positions (a 30 degrees angle between the medial border of the feet with heels together using a V-podalic stabilizer), to tilt the head backwards and forwards to a decreasing extent until a natural head balance was reached, to adopt a natural posture of the shoulders, and to allow both arms to hang free. A self-adhesive circular reflecting cutaneous marker was applied to three points to enable a better view of the landmarks: the most anterior point of the frontonasal suture (N), the auricular tragus (Tr) and the most prominent spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra (C(7)). An operator marked the specific anatomical points of the children's profiles with a felt-tip pen on a mirror placed to one side of the patient and fixed on the wall: the N point, the Tr point, the most inferior point of the chin in the lateral view (Me) and the deepest point on the posterior contour of the cervical lordosis. A digital body posture measuring system captured a first image of each subject in NHP (T0). Five minutes later, with the same position and orientation of the feet, the operator placed the head of the subject in the cephalostat so that the new head position coincided with the head position previously registered in the mirror and a second picture was taken (T1). After a further 5min, the subject was asked to place himself in NHP again, similarly repositioning their own feet to check the precision of the method of positioning, and a third picture was taken (T2). Three craniocervical angular measurements were taken for head posture measurement: N-Tr-Vert, determined by the extended line from the N point to the Tr point and the vertical line projected onto the image by a line (Vert); C(7)-Tr-Vert, determined by the extended line from C(7) to Tr and Vert; and C(7)-Tr-N, the angle between C(7)-Tr line and Tr-N line. In order to determine the stability of all the measurements of head position at T1, T2 and T3, a paired-sample t-test was used using an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.90.\nResults: It was found that there were no statistically significant differences in head position between the pictures at T0, T1 and T2 (N-Tr-Vert, C(7)-Tr-Vert and C(7)-Tr-N, P>0.05).\nConclusion: This method was a good procedure for evaluating head posture without exposure to radiation. The results also suggest that a simple and rapid method can be used to apply a craniostat to the patient when a radiograph is required without modifying the NHP."

  "title": "A paradigm to assess postural responses triggered by anteroposterior translations in healthy seated individuals",
  "date": "2009 Nov",
  "abstract": "Postural adjustments following mechanical perturbations have been studied in healthy seated humans. However, little is known on the minimal intensity that should be used to provoke a reaction. This knowledge could be essential to assess seated postural deficits in some pathological populations. The goal of the present study was to identify a low-intensity perturbation that could elicit postural reactions in healthy seated individuals. Six healthy participants sat on an adapted ergonomic chair fixed on a moveable support surface that was submitted to forward and backward translations. The head and trunk kinematics as well as the activity of sixteen neck and trunk muscles were recorded. The head, arm and trunk center of mass was computed using kinematics and standard anthropometric tables. We found that ramp displacements with an acceleration profile reaching a maximal value of 1.17 m/s(2) elicited reliable kinematic and electromyographic reactions across participants. Head and trunk segments initially responded opposite to the direction of translation, then reversed direction. Median peak-to-peak angular displacements in the neck, head and trunk, respectively, reached 3.6 degrees, 7.0 degrees and 7.1 degrees for forward translations, and 4.0 degrees, 8.2 degrees and 7.0 degrees for backward translations. For forward translations, neck and trunk flexor muscles were activated first, followed by the extensor muscles, whereas for backward translations, extensor muscles were activated first, followed by flexors. Although this perturbation is of low-intensity compared to those typically used previously to evoke postural reactions, this stimulus is sufficient to elicit a reliable response. We suggest that such a perturbation could be used to assess the physical condition of individuals with neck injuries."

  "date": "2009 Sep",
  "abstract": "Study design: Case control study.\nObjectives: To compare the amount of forward head posture (FHP) and cervical range of motion between patients with moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and healthy controls. We also sought to assess the relationships among FHP, cervical range of motion, and clinical variables related to the intensity and temporal profile of pain due to CTS.\nBackground: It is plausible that the cervical spine may be involved in patients with CTS. No studies have investigated the possible associations among FHP, cervical range of motion, and symptoms related to CTS.\nMethods: FHP and cervical range of motion were assessed in 25 women with CTS and 25 matched healthy women. Side-view pictures were taken in both relaxed-sitting and standing positions to measure the craniovertebral angle. A CROM device was used to assess cervical range of motion. Posture and mobility measurements were performed by an experienced therapist blinded to the subjects' condition. Differences in cervical range of motion were examined using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. A 2-way mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in FHP between groups and positions.\nResults: The ANOVA revealed significant differences between groups (F = 30.4; P<.001) and between positions (F = 6.5; P<.01) for FHP assessment. Patients with CTS had a smaller craniovertebral angle (greater FHP) than controls (P<.001) in both standing and sitting. Additionally, patients with CTS showed decreased cervical range of motion in all directions when compared to controls (P<.001). Only cervical flexion (rs = -0.43; P = .02) and lateral flexion contralateral to the side of the CTS (rs = -0.51; P = .01) were associated with the reported lowest pain experienced in the preceding week. A positive association between FHP and cervical range of motion was identified in both groups: the smaller the craniovertebral angle (reflective of a greater FHP), the smaller the range of motion (r values between 0.27 and 0.45; P<.05). Finally, cervical range of motion and FHP were negatively associated with age in the control group but not in the group with CTS.\nConclusions: Patients with mild/moderate CTS exhibited a greater FHP and less cervical range of motion, as compared to healthy controls. Additionally, a greater FHP was associated with a reduction in cervical range of motion. However, a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be inferred from this study. Future research should investigate if FHP and restricted cervical range of motion is a consequence or a causative factor of CTS and related symptoms (eg, pain)."

  "abstract": "Body segment masses and center of mass (COM) locations are required to calculate intersegmental forces and net joint moments using inverse or forward dynamics equations. These inertial properties are estimated from methods involving cadavers or living individuals. The present clinical methods are limited to similar populations from which the anthropometric measures were obtained. This study presented a simple force plate method that can be used to determine subject-specific segment masses and COM locations and compared it to other well-known methods. The proposed method was tested in individuals with different body mass index (i.e., lean, normal, and obese) to verify its sensitivity. All the segmental mass and COM values obtained from the force plate method were within the range of those of the other methods for the entire sample. Significant differences were identified between the morphological groups in relative segmental masses at the upper arm and leg and foot, and COM locations at the leg and foot and head and trunk as obtained from the force plate method (p<0.05). The proposed method involves direct procedures to determine subject-specific segmental masses and COM locations. It is sensitive to detect differences between various morphological populations."

  "date": "2009 Aug",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Obesity is a growing problem in the United States. We examined patients undergoing orthognathic surgical correction for Class II skeletal malocclusions and assessed outcomes in relation to body mass index.\nMethods: The patients (n = 78) were divided into 3 groups (obese, overweight, and normal or thin) based on body mass index score. They were treated with mandibular advancement (mean, 4.9 mm) with rigid fixation and evaluated cephalometrically for postsurgical changes over a 2-year period; a subset of 54 patients was followed for 5 years.\nResults: Obese and overweight patients experienced relative postsurgical forward movements at B-point (means, 2.6 and 1.0 mm, respectively), whereas the normal or thin patients had relapses (mean, -0.7 mm) over the 2 years. This trend held up at 5 years, with the obese patients experiencing 3 mm of forward movement compared with the normal or thin patients. Potential reasons for this difference in postsurgical response are orthopedic effects of tongue posture and hormonal and biochemical differences caused by obesity.\nConclusions: Obese and overweight patients have different responses to mandibular advancement with rigid fixation compared with normal or thin patients. These data should enable orthodontists and surgeons to more appropriately treat obese patients."

  "date": "2009 Dec",
  "abstract": "Background: Several positions are currently utilized for operating patients with posterior fossa lesions. Each individual position has its own risks and benefits, and none has demonstrated its superiority. A dreaded, and probably underreported, complication of these procedures is cervical cord infarction with quadriplegia.\nDiscussion: We reviewed eight previous reported instances of this devastating complication aimed at ascertaining its pathogenesis to suggest preventive strategies. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the occurrence of this complication. Some factors involved in the production of cervical cord infarction include patient's position (seated or prone), hyperflexion of the neck, excessive spinal cord traction, canal stenosis, and systemic arterial hypotension. We hypothesize that spinal cord infarction in our patient might have resulted from compromised blood supply to the midcervical cord caused by tumor infiltration of the cervical leptomeninges in addition to a brief episode of arterial hypotension during venous air embolism.\nCase report: We treated an 8-year-old girl who developed quadriplegia after surgery for a fourth ventricular ependymoma. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cervical cord infarction. Evoked potentials confirmed the diagnosis.\nConclusions: With this report, we want to draw the attention of neurosurgeons to the possibility of the occurrence of this dreadful complication during posterior fossa procedures. Retrospectively, the only measures that might have helped to avoid this complication in our patient would have been using the prone position and intraoperative monitoring of evoked potentials."

  "title": "Visually evoked whole-body turning responses during stepping in place in a virtual environment",
  "date": "2009 Oct",
  "abstract": "Humans use a specific sequence of reorientation of the eyes, head and body to perform turning and redirections while walking. Gaze (eye and head) rotation in a new direction of travel precedes body rotation by as much as 1.5s and provides a stable reference frame that guides subsequent whole-body redirection. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether a visually presented rotation of the external environment can induce whole-body turning lead by gaze redirection in a new travel direction. Five healthy young adults performed a stepping in place task while watching a virtual scene that moved as if they were walking down a hallway, thus providing participants with a perception of forward self motion. While \"forward\" stepping, the virtual scene would gradually turn around a 90 degrees corner. As a result the turn could be anticipated by the participants. Significant horizontal eye movements and head and body rotation magnitudes were observed in response to the virtual visual turning cue. Onset of eye, head and body redirection revealed a sequenced order and timing of segment rotation that is characteristic of steering behaviour in real world turning situations. The results of this study provide support for the hypothesis that gaze redirection may be an essential subcomponent to steering behaviour. The link between visual redirection and coordinated body turning implies instability when turning may result from visual and/or oculomotor deficits."

  "abstract": "Reasons for performing study: It is believed that the head-neck position (HNP) has specific effects on the loading pattern of the equine locomotor system, but very few quantitative data are available.\nObjective: To quantify the effects of 6 different HNPs on forelimb-hindlimb loading and underlying temporal changes.\nMethods: Vertical ground reaction forces of each limb and interlimb coordination were measured in 7 high level dressage horses walking and trotting on an instrumented treadmill in 6 predetermined HNPs: HNP1--unrestrained; HNP2--elevated neck, bridge of the nose in front of the vertical; HNP3--elevated neck, bridge of the nose behind the vertical; HNP4--low and flexed neck; HNP5--head and neck in extreme high position; and HNP6--forward downward extension of head and neck. HNP1 served as a velocity-matched control.\nResults: At the walk, the percentage of vertical stride impulse carried by the forehand (Iz(fore)) as well as stride length and overreach distance were decreased in HNP2, HNP3, HNP4 and HNP5 when compared to HNP1. At the trot, Iz(fore) was decreased in HNP2, HNP3, HNP4 and HNP5. Peak forces in the forelimbs increased in HNP5 and decreased in HNP6. Stance duration in the forelimbs was decreased in HNP2 and HNP5. Suspension duration was increased in HNP2, HNP3 and HNP5. Overreach distance was shorter in HNP4 and longer in HNP6.\nConclusions: In comparison to HNP1 and HNP6, HNPs with elevation of the neck with either flexion or extension at the poll as well as a low and flexed head and neck lead to a weight shift from the forehand to the hindquarters. HNP5 had the biggest effect on limb timing and load distribution. At the trot, shortening of forelimb stance duration in HNP5 increased peak vertical forces although Iz(fore) decreased.\nPotential relevance: Presented results contribute to the understanding of the value of certain HNPs in horse training."

  "abstract": "Adaptation is essential in maintaining stability during balance-challenging situations. We studied, in standing subjects with eyes open and closed, adaptive responses of the anteroposterior head, shoulder, hip and knee movements; gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior EMG activity and anteroposterior body posture when proprioceptive information from the neck or calf muscles underwent vibratory perturbations. After 30s of quiet stance, vibratory stimuli were applied repeatedly for 200s, and adaption to stimulation was analyzed in four successive 50s periods. Repeated neck and calf vibration significantly increased linear body movement variance at all recorded sites (p<0.001, except neck stimulation with eyes closed, EC-neck), increased tibialis anterior (p<0.001, except EC-neck) and gastrocnemious muscle activity (p<0.001). Most body movement variances and tibialis anterior EMG activity decreased significantly over time (most p-values<0.01 or lower) and overall, the body leaning forward increased from 5.5 degrees to 6.5 degrees (p<0.01). The characteristics of the responses were influenced by vision and site of vibration, e.g., neck vibration affected body posture more rapidly than calf vibration. Our findings support the notion that proprioceptive perturbations have different effects in terms of nature, degree and adaptive response depending on site of vibratory proprioceptive stimulation, a factor that needs consideration in clinical investigations and design of rehabilitation programs."

  "abstract": "Objective: Changes in posture are of concern because of their association with pain or impaired physical function. Previous studies that have used computer-aided video motion analysis systems to measure posture have been compromised by the use of problematic models of skin marker placement. This study aimed to quantify and compare sagittal spinal posture in standing and sitting between young and older adults using a two-dimensional PEAK Motus system and a revised skin marker model.\nMethods: Twenty-four healthy young adults and 22 healthy older adults volunteered for this study. The angles of the upper and lower cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine as well as the orientations of the head, neck, and pelvic plane with respect to an external reference were measured in the standing and sitting positions.\nResults: Compared to young adults, healthy older adults demonstrated a forward head posture, with increased lower cervical spine flexion and increased upper cervical extension in both positions. Older adults also sat with significantly increased thoracic kyphosis and decreased lumbar spine flexion.\nConclusion: The angular relationship between adjacent spinal regions in the sagittal plane can be objectively quantified using image-based analysis. The concept that the anteroposterior tilt of the pelvis in standing dictates the lumbar and thoracic curves was supported by the correlations between these adjacent regions in both age groups. The model of skin marker placement used in this study can have a broader application as a clinical tool for image-based postural assessment."

  "abstract": "Objective: To compare standing head posture measurements between patients with nontraumatic neck pain (NP) and pain-free individuals.\nDesign: Single-blind (assessor) cross-sectional study.\nSetting: Hospital and general community.\nParticipants: Consecutive patients (n=40) with chronic nontraumatic NP and age- and sex-matched pain-free participants (n=40).\nInterventions: Not applicable.\nMain outcome measures: Three angular measurements: the angle between C7, the tragus of the ear, and the horizontal; the angle between the tragus of the ear, the eye, and the horizontal; and the angle between the inferior margins of the right and the left ear and the horizontal were calculated through the digitization of video images.\nResults: NP patients were found to have a significantly smaller angle between C7, the tragus, and the horizontal, resulting in a more forward head posture than pain-free participants (NP, mean +/- SD, 45.4 degrees +/-6.8 degrees ; pain-free, mean +/- SD, 48.6 degrees +/-7.1 degrees ; P<.05; confidence interval [CI] for the difference between groups, 0.9 degrees -6.3 degrees ). Dividing the population according to age into younger (</=50y) and older (>50y) revealed an interaction, with a statistically significant difference in head posture for younger participants with NP compared with younger pain-free participants (NP, mean +/- SD, 46.1 degrees +/-6.7 degrees ; pain-free, mean +/- SD, 51.8 degrees +/-5.9 degrees ; P<.01; CI for the difference between groups, 1.8 degrees -9.7 degrees ) but no difference for the older group (NP, mean +/- SD, 44.8 degrees +/-7.1 degrees ; pain-free, mean +/- SD, 45.1 degrees +/-6.7 degrees ; P>.05; CI for the difference between groups, -4.9 degrees -4.2 degrees ). No other differences were found between patients and pain-free participants.\nConclusions: Younger patients with chronic nontraumatic NP were shown to have a more forward head posture in standing than matched pain-free participants. However, the difference, although statistically significant, was perhaps too small to be clinically meaningful."

  "title": "Influence of oral appliances on craniocervical posture in obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome patients",
  "date": "2009 Jul",
  "abstract": "Purpose: The existence of a relationship between head posture and mandibular function has been discussed by several authors. However, the relationship between head posture and the cervical spine in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) who are using oral appliances (OAs) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the cervical spine associated with the use of OAs in patients with OSAHS.\nMethods: Fifteen patients (4 females and 11 males; mean age, 48 years) diagnosed with OSAHS were randomly selected. An OA was fabricated individually for each patient. Two lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken while the patient was sitting awake in an upright position. The first radiograph was taken in the intercuspal position and the second was taken while the subject was wearing the OA. Analyses based on the sella-nasion (SN) line were performed in the lateral cephalogram. Comparison of craniocervical angles in patients with and without the OA was performed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test.\nResults: Cephalometric analysis showed that the craniocervical angles (CVT-C2V and SN-C4) with OA were higher than those without OA (P<0.05). It seems that the OA caused a significant flexion of the cranium on the upper cervical spine. A significant increase in the craniocervical angle occurred in the fourth cervical segment.\nConclusion: The changes in forward flexion of the upper cervical spine found in this study imply that changes in the craniocervical relationship should be evaluated periodically after an OA has been inserted."

  "title": "Converting apogeotropic into geotropic lateral canalolithiasis by head-pitching manoeuvre in the sitting position",
  "date": "2008 Dec",
  "abstract": "Liberatory treatment of lateral canalolithiasis is more effective for the geotropic, than for the apogeotropic forms and, therefore, it is worthwhile attempting to convert the apogeotropic forms into the geotropic forms. In 36 cases of apogeotropic lateral canalolithiasis, one to five Head-Pitch Manoeuvres were performed in the sitting position (Head-Pitch Test) in the attempt to transform apogeotropic into geotropic lateral canalolithiasis. The Head Pitch Test was performed by a quick 60 degrees forward-flexion and a slow maximal backward-extension of the head. The Head-Pitch Test was effective in 36.1% of cases, less than the repeated Head-Rolling in the supine position, but it was always well tolerated by patients. The quick 60 degrees forward-flexion of the head can evoke a horizontal nystagmus beating towards the healthy side in apogeotropic lateral canalolithiasis and towards the affected side in geotropic lateral canalolithiasis (Bow Nystagmus). Slow backward-extension of the head can evoke a horizontal nystagmus beating towards the affected side in apogeotropic lateral canalolithiasis and toward the healthy side in geotropic lateral canalolithiasis (Lean Nystagmus). Conversion from apogeotropic to geotropic lateral canalolithiasis by the Head-Pitch Test was effective when Bow and Lean Nystagmus changed directions or when the Head-Pitch Test evoked Bow Nystagmus toward the affected side and Lean Nystagmus toward the healthy side. Conversion occurred in 10 patients during the 60 degrees forward-flexion of the head. In contrast, in 3 patients, it occurred during extension of the head, when a \"Lean Nystagmus\" toward the healthy side appeared. In addition, Pseudospontaneous Nystagmus and Positioning Nystagmus that arose when the patient moved from the sitting to the supine position changed direction or were evoked ex-novo, both directed toward the healthy side. In all cases, Pagnini-McClure diagnostic manoeuvre confirmed the transformation with a Positional Paroxysmal Horizontal Geotropic Nystagmus, which was more intense when the affected ear was brought down. The Head-Pitch Test can be used as the method of choice to transform apogeotropic into geotropic lateral canalolithiasis. However, anterior flexion of the head in the geotropic forms must be avoided since involuntary and harmful transformations from the geotropic into the apogeotropic form can occur, moving otoliths towards the anterior arm and cupula."

  "title": "Whiplash-associated disorders affect postural reactions to antero-posterior support surface translations during sitting",
  "date": "2009 Jun",
  "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that individuals with WAD display decreased postural stability during standing and walking tasks. However, their ability to maintain seated upright posture has never been investigated. The objective of this study was to characterize kinematic and electromyographic postural stabilization patterns in individuals with chronic WAD and to compare these patterns with those in an able-bodied control group. Ten individuals with WAD and an age- and gender-matched group of healthy individuals were exposed to sudden forward and backward support surface translations while they were seated. Neck and trunk muscle activity and angular displacements as well as centers of mass (COMs) linear displacements at four levels of the head and trunk were computed. The displacement onset of the combined head, arms and trunk COM was significantly delayed in persons with WAD. However, their peak trunk angles were smaller and were reached sooner. In the WAD group, the activation onset of the lumbar erector spinae was less affected by perturbation direction and the sternocleidomastoid muscle, a neck flexor, showed a trend towards being activated later, compared to the healthy group. These results suggest that individuals with WAD may alter stretch reflex threshold and/or elicit a learned response for pain avoidance that may be direction-specific. Such findings highlight the importance of assessing both spatial and temporal characteristics across different levels of the spinal musculoskeletal system to evaluate multidirectional postural responses in WAD individuals."

  "date": "2009 Jul",
  "abstract": "The aim of this pilot study was to add weight to a hypothesis according to which patients presenting with chronic neck pain could have a predisposition towards respiratory dysfunction. Twelve patients with chronic neck pain and 12 matched controls participated in this study. Spirometric values, maximal static pressures, forward head posture and functional tests were examined in all subjects. According to the results, chronic neck patients presented with a statistically significant decreased maximal voluntary ventilation (P = 0.042) and respiratory muscle strength (Pimax and Pemax), (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the current study demonstrated a strong association between an increased forward head posture and decreased respiratory muscle strength in neck pateits. The connection of neck pain and respiratory function could be an important consideration in relation to patient assessment, rehabilitation and consumption of pharmacological agents."

  "date": "2008",
  "abstract": "Whole-body shocks and vibrations experienced during manual wheelchair use can decrease an individual's comfort, increase the rate of fatigue, result in injury, and consequently limit mobility and community participation. We used a wheelchair-vibration simulator to examine whether the seat reaction forces experienced by wheelchair users were differentially influenced by wheelchair suspension, trunk-muscle innervations, and ground speed. We used wheelchairs instrumented with load cells and accelerometers to determine the forces transmitted from the seat frame and the head accelerations experienced by riders. We determined that self-selected speed, seat force, and head accelerations differed between subjects with and without trunk-muscle innervations and between rigid and suspension wheelchairs. Seat force and head accelerations were greatest in the rigid-frame wheelchair and lowest in the spring-type suspension-frame wheelchairs. Those participants without trunk-muscle innervations preferred slower speeds than those with trunk-muscle innervations. Forward head accelerations were greater in those without than with trunk-muscle innervations. Wheelchair rear-suspension systems may improve wheelchair mobility function in terms of comfort at higher velocity by minimizing the seat forces and head accelerations experienced by the riders, especially those with higher level spinal cord injury and diminished postural control."

  "date": "2009 May",
  "abstract": "Dentists reported high perceived physical work conditions. Working postures and movements of the head and upper extremities during dental work were registered with inclinometry measurements during four hours. The aim was to clarify the relationship between measured working postures/movements and perceived physical work conditions. Dentists worked with elevated arms and a rather steep forward inclination of the head. Correlations (r=-0.52 to -0.66) between inclination velocity and perceived workload on VAS scales were found, but there were only weak correlations between observed working postures. The different tasks involved in dental work provide limited variation in work movements and postures, measured by inclinometry. By alternating between sitting and standing, it might be possible to achieve variation in physical workload during dental work."

  "abstract": "Objective: To assess the effect of head position on relative position of the larynx and hyoid apparatus in horses with palatal dysfunction, and to define a standard position for radiographic assessment of laryngeal tie-forward.\nStudy design: Prospective clinical study.\nAnimals: Adult horses (n=9) with palatal dysfunction.\nMethods: Left lateral radiographs of the larynx were obtained pre and postoperatively for 3 different head positions (flexed=90 degrees ; neutral=100 degrees ; extended=115 degrees ). Distance between thyrohyoid bone and thyroid cartilage was measured. Data were analyzed to investigate differences between head positions, and to compare differences between pre- and postoperative measurements.\nResults: Head position had a significant effect on relative position of the larynx and hyoid apparatus preoperatively. There was no significant difference in postoperative measurements of the 3 head positions. A significant difference between pre- and postoperative measurements was found with the head in the neutral or extended position whereas there were no significant differences between pre- and postoperative measurements using the flexed position.\nConclusions: Head position affects the relationship between the hyoid apparatus and larynx preoperatively, with greatest distance occurring when the head is extended. In a flexed position, it is not possible to ascertain whether laryngeal position has changed postoperatively.\nClinical relevance: A standardized head position is necessary when assessing the laryngeal tie-forward procedure radiographically. An extended head position is most useful for this assessment."

VEMPs were recorded in 14 subjects seated with their heads and necks tilted 120 degrees forward on the interaural axis. The head was rotated 45 degrees to the left or right from the sagittal plane; an angular acceleration around the earth's vertical axis was then provided. When the posterior semicircular canal (PSCC) of the recording side was excited, the rotation was defined as 'ipsilateral rotation', and the opposite rotation was defined as 'contralateral rotation'. The background muscle activity-corrected p13-n23 amplitude (CA) in the ipsilateral rotation was significantly smaller than CAs in the static state and the contralateral rotation. Functional interaction between the saccule and the PSCC could be detected."

  "date": "2009 Dec 20",
  "abstract": "To detect the effect of microgravity on vestibular responses, we conducted Coriolis stimulation experiments at 1 G and μ G. Five men with vision occluded were asked to tilt their head forward while rotating at 100 degrees/sec. Postural changes were recorded by a 3D linear accelerometer, and the distance of upper body movement was derived from recordings of linear acceleration. Eye movements were recorded by a CCD camera. For a second period after commencing head tilt, the upper body moved 10 cm in the direction of inertia input at 1 G, but it moved to the opposite direction at μ G, i.e., 4 cm in the direction of inertia force. Nystagmus peak slow-phase velocity immediately after head tilt and its attenuation process did not differ between 1 G and μ G. The strength of movement sensation and the severity of motion sickness were far weaker at μ G than at 1 G. It was concluded that inertia input is valid to induce postural and sensation responses only when the external reference is given Z axis by gravity. Vestibular ocular response may be maintained at μ G because the head reference is valid even after the external reference becomes arbitrary."

  "date": "2008 Dec",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Present the performance of WHIPS and identify possible next steps of soft tissue neck injury reduction potentials, based on rear-end real-world crash data.\nMethods: Front-seat occupants (above 14 years of age) have been analyzed regarding influencing factors on reported incidences of soft tissue neck injuries. The outcome of 1858 occupants in cars equipped with WHIPS and 663 occupants in Volvo cars of model year 1999 without WHIPS are studied with respect to WHIPS injury-reducing effect for different impact severities and injury durations. The occupants in WHIPS are further studied with respect to seating position and sitting posture, such as turned head and head-to-head restraint distance.\nResults: Soft tissue neck injury risk reductions are seen for occupants in WHIPS as compared to prior Volvo cars; mean values ranging from 21 to 47% depending on impact severity and symptom duration. Sitting posture (turned head and increased backset) increases soft tissue neck injury risks. Based on the self-reported injury data, a significantly lower risk was found for occupants facing straight forward with the head in close proximity to the head restraint as compared to the risk for occupants with rotated head and a larger backset. Even though the highest risk of soft tissue neck injuries is found in higher impact severity, the large amount of soft tissue neck injuries sustained at low impact severity emphasizes the need of focusing measures for crash avoidance.\nConclusions: This study presents the development and real-world performance of WHIPS as well as identifies situations for further focus and challenges for the next generation of soft tissue neck injury protection and prevention, including areas such as occupant posture and crash avoidance."

  "date": "2008 Dec",
  "abstract": "Objectives: This study presents an investigation of anti-whiplash features that can be implemented in a car seat to reduce whiplash injuries in the case of a rear impact. The main emphasis is on achieving a seat design with good energy absorption properties.\nMethods: A biofidelic 50th percentile male multi-body human model for rear impact is developed to evaluate the performance of car seat design concepts. The model is validated using the responses of 7 volunteers from the Japanese Automobile Research Institute (JARI) sled tests, which were performed at an impact speed of 8 kph with a rigid seat and without head restraint and seatbelt. A generic multi-body car seat model is also developed to implement various seatback and recliner properties, anti-whiplash devices, and head restraints. Using the same driving posture and the rigid seat in the JARI sled tests as the basic configuration, several anti-whiplash seats are designed to allow different types of motion for the seatback and seat-pan.\nResults: The anti-whiplash car seat design concepts limit neck internal motion successfully until the head-to-head restraint contact occurs and they exhibit low NIC(max) values (7 m(2)/s(2) on average). They are also effective in reducing neck compression forces and T1 forward accelerations. In principle, these car seat design concepts employ controlled recliner rotation and seat-pan displacement to limit the formation of S-shape. This is accomplished by using anti-whiplash devices that absorb the crash energy in such a way that an optimum protection is provided at different severities.\nConclusions: The results indicate that the energy absorbing car seat design concepts all demonstrate good whiplash-reducing performances at the IIWPG standard pulse. Especially in higher severity rear impacts, two of the car seat design concepts reduce the ramping of the occupant considerably."

  "date": "2009 Feb",
  "abstract": "Objective: Mouth-breathing is a common clinical condition among school-age children and some studies have correlated this condition with quality of life and postural alterations. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the orientation and position of the scapula, thoracic spine and head posture among mouth-breathing (MB) children and nasal-breathing (NB) children.\nMethods: Twenty-one male MB children and 21 male NB children between 8 and 12 years of age participated in the study. Data were obtained through a stereophotogrammetry system that uses passive markers over anatomical landmarks to capture the position of the segments. Internal rotation, upward rotation, anterior tilt, scapular elevation and abduction were measured bilaterally as well as thoracic kyphosis, forward head position and shoulder protrusion.\nResults: The MB children showed increased scapular superior position in relation to the NB group. No statistically significant differences were found between groups regarding the angular and linear measurements of the scapula. To verify reliability, three measurements were taken for each variable in the study. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed results above 0.8 for all the variables except for the internal rotation angle (I-Rot), below 0.5, probably due to uncertainty in the palpation of the inferior angle of the scapula. Ninety-five percent of the NB children and 58% among the MB children had been breastfed, this difference was statistically significant. There were statistically significant differences between groups regarding the domains of the Autoquestionnaire Qualité de Vie Enfant Imagé (AUQEI) scale and body mass index, which was higher among the NB children.\nConclusions: MB children increased scapular superior position in comparison to NB children due probably to the position of forward head, leading to an alteration in the positioning of the mandible. The absence of significantly difference in posture pattern between groups in the present study could attributed to height-weight development in this age, as the posture of children changes in order to adapt to new body proportions, regardless of health status. The results observed in this study demonstrate the importance of using reliable measurements in the postural assessment of MB and NB children helping physical therapists to focus their strategies during rehabilitation in more specific conditions."

  "date": "2009 Jan",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of different head positions on jaw closing points during tapping movements. The jaw movements of 20 adult volunteers were assessed using a new jaw-tracking device. All subjects had stable maximal intercuspation with their natural dentitions. The subjects were asked to seat on a dental chair with their head upright, and tapping movements were recorded for 5 s without any further instructions. After the chair was reclined to the horizontal position, tapping movements were also recorded with the head in the supine position. The location of the tapping point was defined as the jaw position which was the most closed to the maximum intercuspal position during each tapping stroke. Fifteen tapping points were obtained from the upright and supine head positions of each subject. Six-hundred tapping points were compared to evaluate the effects of different head positions. With the head upright, tapping points were relatively stable and close to the jaw position at the maximum intercuspation. However, in the supine position, tapping points varied widely and shifted forward. The average distance between the positions of the incisal point at the maximum intercuspation and at the tapping points was 0.11 mm (SD, 0.10) in the upright position and 0.30 mm (SD, 0.08) in the supine position. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a significant difference (P < 0.01) between these distances. We conclude that tapping points shift anteriorly in the supine position."

  "abstract": "There are several reports suggesting that forward head posture is associated with temporomandibular disorders and restraint of mandibular growth, possibly due to mandibular displacement posteriorly. However, there have been few reports in which the condylar position was examined in forward head posture. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the condyle moves posteriorly in the forward head posture. The condylar position and electromyography from the masseter, temporal and digastric muscles were recorded on 15 healthy male adults at mandibular rest position in the natural head posture and deliberate forward head posture. The condylar position in the deliberate forward head posture was significantly more posterior than that in the natural head posture. The activity of the masseter and digastric muscles in the deliberate forward head posture was slightly increased. These results suggest that the condyle moves posteriorly in subjects with forward head posture."

  "date": "2008 Oct",
  "abstract": "Caudal fin-wave propagation (CFP) is a commonly observed behavior in a fish but has been little investigated. Our objective is to understand the function of a CFP for a forward-sinking parrot cichlid that adopts a tilted-down swimming posture. We utilized stereoscopic digital particle-image velocimetry to measure the velocity fields in the wake of both the caudal fin and the pectoral fins and to evaluate the corresponding hydrodynamic forces. The tilted-down posture of this fish is inherently unstable because of the presence of the head-down pitching moment induced from the buoyant force of the body. The down-stroke of the pectoral fins results also in a head-down pitching moment that destabilizes the fish. Our results indicate that a CFP facilitates the pitching stabilization of a fish. In a forward-sinking parrot cichlid, a CFP produces periodic jets (CFP jets) that are oriented laterally and posterodorsally, which result in both thrust and negative lift that induce a head-up pitching moment. The CFP jets are initially trapped by the ventral part of the caudal fin, strengthened and reoriented by the dorsally propagating fin wave, and expelled near the dorsal part of the caudal fin."

  "date": "2008 Aug",
  "abstract": "Background: Rapid stepping reactions are a prevalent response to sudden loss of balance and play a crucial role in preventing falls. A previous study indicated that young adults are able to guide these stepping reactions amid challenging environmental constraints using \"stored\" visuospatial information. This study addressed whether healthy older adults also use \"stored\" visuospatial information in this manner, or are more dependent on \"online\" visual control.\nMethods: Gaze behavior was recorded during rapid forward-stepping reactions evoked by unpredictable platform perturbation, as participants performed a concurrent task demanding visual attention. Challenging obstacles and/or step targets were used to increase demands for accurate foot motion. Twelve healthy older adults (61-73 years) were compared to 12 young adults (22-29 years) tested in a previous study.\nResults: Similar to young adults, older participants seldom redirected gaze downward in response to the perturbation (11% of trials), yet were commonly able to clear the obstacle (74% of trials) or land on the target (41% of trials) while stepping to recover balance. The threat posed by the obstacle apparently prompted older adults to initiate early downward saccades during a small proportion (18%) of obstacle trials; however, this did not improve ability to clear the obstacle.\nConclusion: Aging did not alter the predominant visual-control strategy used to guide the stepping reactions. Both young and older persons typically used stored visuospatial information, thereby allowing vision/attention to be switched to other demands during the stepping reaction and minimizing head/eye movements that could exacerbate the destabilizing effect of the balance perturbation."

  "abstract": "The social cognitive capacities of dogs, including their communication skills and use of visual attention cues, have recently been investigated in numerous experimental studies. This paper reports on research of domestic dog behavior in a natural setting, which shows sensitivity to the visual attention of their partners when engaged in dyadic rough-and-tumble play. The sequential behaviors and head-direction of both dogs were noted throughout the bouts. The behaviors were differentially used according to the partner's posture. Play signals were sent nearly exclusively to forward-facing conspecifics; attention-getting behaviors were used most often when a playmate was facing away, and before signaling an interest to play. In addition, the mode of attention-getter matched the degree of inattentiveness of the playmate: stronger attention-getters were used when a playmate was looking away or distracted, less forceful ones when the partner was facing forward or laterally. In other words, these dogs showed attention to, and acted to manipulate, a feature of other dogs that mediates their ability to respond: which feature in human interaction is called \"attention\"."

  "abstract": "The application of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) evokes distinct responses in lower limb muscles involved in the control of balance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the balance and lower limb muscle responses to short-duration GVS and to determine whether these responses are modulated by small changes in center of gravity (CoG) and baseline muscle activity occurring during quiet standing. Twelve subjects stood quietly on a force plate with their feet together and were instructed to look straight ahead. One thousand twenty-four GVS stimuli (4 mA, 20-ms pulses) were delivered bilaterally to the mastoid processes in a bipolar, binaural configuration. Bilateral surface electromyography (EMG) from soleus (Sol) and tibialis anterior (TA) and ground reaction forces were recorded. EMG and force responses were trigger averaged at the onset of the GVS pulse. Short-duration GVS applied during quiet standing with the head facing forward evoked characteristic balance responses and biphasic modulation of all muscles with the same polarity for ipsilateral Sol and TA. The amplitude of the GVS-evoked muscle responses was modulated by both the estimated position of the subject's CoG and the background activation of the recorded muscle. Muscle-dependent modulations of the GVS-evoked muscle responses were observed: the Sol responses decreased, while the TA responses increased when the CoG position shifted toward the heels. The well-defined balance responses evoked by short-duration GVS are important to acknowledge when studying the vestibulo-motor responses in healthy subjects and patient populations."

  "date": "2009 Jan",
  "abstract": "Background: Postural instability in older people is associated with an increased risk of falling. This experiment investigated the effects of different gaze strategies on postural stability in older people, when using distance single-vision compared with multifocal (progressive addition lens and bifocal) spectacles.\nMethods: Eighteen healthy older habitual multifocal spectacle-wearers (mean age 72.1 +/- 4.0 years) participated in a randomised, cross-over study. Postural stability during quiet standing was assessed as the root mean square excursion in the centre of pressure (RMS-COP) in the antero-posterior direction. Ground reaction force data were collected (for 30 seconds), while subjects viewed one of two visual targets (one square metre) of different spatial frequencies and contrasts, while wearing either distance single-vision or multifocal (progressive addition and bifocal) spectacles. The visual targets were positioned either ahead at eye-level or on the ground (viewing distance 2.06 metres) and viewed under the following head-gaze conditions; 'head neutral-gaze forward', 'head flexed-gaze down' and 'head neutral-gaze down'.\nResults: The type of spectacles worn or the target viewed had no significant effect on postural stability but postural stability deteriorated (antero-posterior RMS-COP excursion increased) in the 'head neutral-gaze down' compared with the 'head flexed-gaze down' and 'head neutral-gaze forward' conditions (5.9, 5.5 and 5.0 mm respectively, p < 0.001).\nConclusions: Multifocal use had no effect on standing postural stability. Irrespective of spectacles worn, when fixating a visual target positioned at ground level, postural stability was better in the 'head flexed-gaze down' condition compared with the 'head neutral-gaze down' condition. A useful strategy to reduce falling in the older person might be to advise multifocal and distance single-vision spectacle-wearers to flex their heads rather than just lower their eyes when looking downwards."

  "title": "Pediatric lumbar Chance fractures in British Columbia: chart review and analysis of the use of shoulder restraints in MVAs",
  "date": "2008 Jul",
  "abstract": "Chance fractures of the skeletally immature spine classically occur in frontal motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) when the occupants are restrained by a lap belt only and undergo traumatic hyperflexion of the torso during the impact. We retrospectively examined all MVA-related Chance fractures at British Columbia's Children's Hospital since 1986, by collecting injury and seat-belt use information from chart data and imaging studies. Twenty-six patients were included in the study, 14 wore a lap belt only, seven wore a three-point restraint properly, and five were reportedly misusing the shoulder portion of a three-point restraint. The subjects ranged in age from 3 to 16 with a mean age of 10.6 years. Eleven of the 26 (42%) patients sustained abdominal viscera injuries, seven of the 26 patients suffered neurologic injury (spinal cord and/or spinal nerve injury) associated with their spinal fracture, with two cases of complete paralysis, and there was a 38% incidence of head injury. Concomitant injuries (i.e. to the head, abdomen and abdominal contents) tended to be mitigated by the presence of a properly worn shoulder restraint. This leads to the conclusion that Chance fractures can be sustained even when the occupant is using a shoulder belt to restrain their torso. The mechanism responsible for this is unknown. This may indicate that Chance fractures can be caused by a lesser degree of torso hyperflexion than previously thought. Alternatively, we also speculate that Chance fractures can occur while the torso is restrained by the shoulder belt if the hips submarine beneath the lap belt and the torso experiences hyperflexion secondary to forward excursion of the pelvis and legs during the collision. Future work is necessary to confirm these mechanisms and to find ways to prevent them. These studies will need to use computational or experimental child surrogates that can sit in a slouched posture and submarine during a collision."

  "title": "Complaints of the arm, neck and shoulder among computer office workers in Sudan: a prevalence study with validation of an Arabic risk factors questionnaire",
  "date": "2008 Jun 27",
  "abstract": "Background: Complaints of the arm, neck and/or shoulders (CANS) in general and computer-related disorders in particular affect millions of computer office workers in Western developed countries. However, with the widespread use of computer systems in developing countries, the associated musculoskeletal complaints are yet to be investigated.\nAim: To study the prevalence of work-related CANS, among computer office workers in Sudan, and to test the psychometric properties of a translated Dutch questionnaire in Arabic language.\nMethods: In 2005 282 computer office workers at a mobile telecommunication company and three banks in Khartoum, Sudan, received an Arabic language version of the validated Maastricht upper extremity questionnaire (MUEQ). The questionnaire holds 109 items covering demographic characteristics, in addition to six main domains (i.e. work station, body posture, break time, job control, job demands and social support) assessing potential physical and psychosocial risk factors. Forward/backward translation of the MUQE was done independently by two different translators. Prevalence over the past year were computed for CANS. Further, the psychometric properties of the Arabic questionnaire were investigated (i.e. factor structure and reliability) and cross-validation was carried out.\nResults: The response rate of the questionnaire was 88% (n = 250). The one-year prevalence of CANS showed that 53% of the respondents could be classified as mild cases. The highest incidences were found for neck and shoulder symptoms (64% and 41% respectively). The analysis of the psychometric properties of the scale resulted in the identification of 2 factors for each of the 6 domains (i.e. office equipment, computer position, head and body posture, awkward body posture, autonomy, quality of break time, skill discretion, decision authority, time pressure, task complexity, social support, and work flow). The calculation of internal consistency and cross validation provided evidence of reliability and lack of redundancy of items.\nConclusion: The prevalence of CANS among the targeted population seems to correspond strongly with prevalence of CANS in Western developed countries. The Arabic translation of the MUEQ has satisfactory psychometric properties to be used to assess work-related risk factors for the development of CANS among computer office workers in Sudan."

  "date": "2008 Apr-May",
  "abstract": "In clinical training of some lower back pain patients, teaching them to control their lumbar lordosis during lifting may be difficult. Therefore, another effective method for lifting technique is required. In standing, head cannot move without some compensating postural adjustment. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of head position on lifting posture. Fourteen healthy male volunteers (22.6 +/- 4.4 years old) lifted a case while maintaining two different head positions; a downward position and an upright position. In the upright position, activities of the latissimus dorsi and vastus lateralis significantly increased, and these of the biceps femoris significantly decreased during the initial 100 msec phase of lifting. There were no differences in the activities of the upper trapezius, lumbar extensor muscles (L3, L5), and obliquus abdominis under the two conditions. There were also no differences in the lumbar angle when the case was lifted. The flexion angles of the hip, knee, and ankle significantly increased, and the lumbar spine moved closer to the case. Lifting posture was influenced by the head position. Advantages included being able to shift loads on the body from the lower back to the legs, to move the lumbar spine closer to the case, and to relatively increase the moment of lumbar extension. The weight of the head as it moved upward and back, and the weight of the rear part of the body as it moved downward and forward helped to maintain balance."

  "date": "2008 Jul",
  "abstract": "This study was designed to elucidate the effects of a ball-backrest at different heights on the head and shoulder posture and neck and trunk muscles of visual display terminal (VDT) workers who adopted a forward head posture when working at a VDT. Twenty-three VDT workers with forward head posture performed the keyboard typing work at a VDT without and with a ball-backrest at the L3, T10, and T4 levels. Surface electromyograms were recorded from the neck, shoulder, and trunk muscles, and the forward head angle and forward shoulder angle were analyzed using a 3-D motion analysis system. The significance of differences for the ball-backrest at different heights was tested by repeated one-way ANOVA, with the significance cutoff set at p=0.05. The mean forward head angle and forward shoulder angle decreased in the order of no backrest, T10-level ball-backrest, T4-level ball-backrest. Compared with not using a backrest, the activity of midcervical muscles was significantly lower and that of the lower trapezius was significantly higher when using a T4-level ball-backrest, and the activity of the internal oblique abdominal muscle was significantly higher when using a T10-level ball-backrest. We suggested that using T4 and T10-level ball-backrests would produce similar effects to active exercise, such as ball exercise for trunk stabilization, and that a ball-backrest would prevent kinematics changes. Therefore, the height of the backrest must be determined on the basis of the characteristics of work-related musculoskeletal disorders when applying a ball-backrest to VDT workers with such disorders."

  "date": "2008 Jun",
  "abstract": "This study tested the effects of three alternative types of backpack on head posture and neck muscle electromyography (EMG) in children. Four loading conditions were tested: no pack; a backpack; a double pack; a modified double pack (designed with a backpack and a front pack weighing 10% and 5% of body weight, respectively). Dependent variables were neck muscle activity, forward head angle and forward head distance (the perpendicular distance from C7 to a vertical line through the tragus of the ear). Fifteen children were asked to walk at a speed of 0.8 m/s on a treadmill. The EMG activity of upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and midcervical paraspinals muscles and the forward head angle and forward head distance were all significantly higher when carrying a backpack than for the other conditions. When carrying a double pack, there was a backward head posture characterised by an increased negative forward head angle, decreased forward head distance, increased sternocleidomastoid EMG signal and decreased midcervical paraspinals EMG signal, compared to carrying no pack. When carrying a modified double pack, the forward head angle and forward head distance decreased when compared to carrying a backpack. These findings indicate that the modified double pack minimises postural deviation."

  "date": "2008 Sep",
  "abstract": "To clarify the relationship between head posture and pharyngeal airway space (PAS), the cephalometric parameters at different head postures were examined. Twelve normal Japanese adults (6 males and 6 females) were examined. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken at five different head postures in each person. All radiographs were traced, and the measurements were analyzed statistically. PAS was significantly increased by forward inclination of the cervical spine. The most significant correlation was found between the change in CVT/NSL (cranio-cervical inclination in the second and fourth vertebrae) and the change in PAS-TP (the minimal pharyngeal airway space) (r(2)=0.79 in males, r(2)=0.67 in females). The mean CVT/NSL when the head was in the natural (neutral) position was 100.9 degrees in males and 103.5 degrees in females. Linear regression analysis revealed DeltaPAS (mm)=0.37DeltaCVT/NSL (degree) (r(2)=0.79, p<0.0001) in males, and DeltaPAS (mm)=0.33DeltaCVT/NSL (degree) (r(2)=0.51, p<0.0001) in females. The correlation equations were obtained as follows: the corrected PAS (mm)=the actual PAS (mm)+0.37[100.9-the actual NSL/CVT (degree)] in males, and the corrected PAS (mm)=the actual PAS (mm)+0.33[103.5-the actual NSL/CVT (degree)] in females. These results will contribute to obtaining an accurate assessment of the PAS that should be corrected by the cranio-cervical inclination."

  "date": "2008 Apr",
  "abstract": "Numerous studies suggest that temporomandibular disorders may be associated with forward head posture. The current study presents a need for an intervention that will effectively facilitate an ideal postural alignment of the head. The Occivator (Posteocentric Systems, Mastic Beach, NY) is an intervention speculated to improve forward head posture (FHP). However there has not been a randomized study to correlate use of the Occivator with improvement of FHP. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Occivator as a therapeutic intervention for the correction of FHP. Using a plumb line, twenty-nine (29) subjects were selected on the basis of having FHP. The CROM (cervical range of motion) device was used to determine measurement of forward head position for each group, pre and post an eight week period. The experimental group followed a specific protocol of 20 minutes of stretches and exercises on the Occivator, two times a week for eight weeks. The control group did not receive any intervention. The experimental group as compared to the control group, demonstrated significant improvement for forward head posture (p = .02). Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Occivator."

  "title": "Efficacy of electrotactile vestibular substitution in patients with peripheral and central vestibular loss",
  "date": "2007",
  "abstract": "Vestibular dysfunction of either central or peripheral origin can significantly affect balance, posture, and gait. We conducted a pilot study to test the effectiveness of training with the BrainPort balance device in subjects with a balance dysfunction due to peripheral or central vestibular loss. The BrainPort balance device transmits information about the patient's head position via electrotactile stimulation of the tongue. Head position data is sensed by an accelerometer and displayed on the tongue as a pattern of stimulation. This pattern of stimulation moves forward, backward, and laterally on the tongue in direct response to head movements. Users of the device were trained to use this stimulation to adjust their position in order to maintain their balance. Twenty-eight subjects with peripheral or central vestibular loss were trained with the BrainPort balance device and tested using the following standardized quantitative measurements of the treatment effects: Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) using the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC), and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). All subjects had chronic balance problems and all but one had previously participated in vestibular rehabilitation therapy. The scores on the clinical tests upon entry into the study were compared to their scores following training with the BrainPort balance device. Our results exhibit consistent positive and statistically significant improvements in balance, posture and gait. These results exceed what could normally be achieved in three to five days of traditional balance training alone. Since this was not a controlled study, we are unable to distinguish the degree to which these improvements are attributable to training with the BrainPort balance device versus the balance exercises performed by all subjects as a part of the BrainPort training sessions. Nonetheless, after training with the BrainPort balance device, all subjects demonstrated significant improvements in performance beyond what might be expected from conventional vestibular rehabilitation therapy."

  "date": "2008 Mar",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of common faulty postures among adolescents and identify if significant relationships existed among the number of faulty postures, psychologic distress, and musculoskeletal symptoms.\nMethods: The Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and Chinese Health Questionnaire were randomly distributed to 300 high school students in the Tainan area. On-campus postural screening, which included digital photography, manual muscle tests, and flexibility tests, was also performed.\nResults: Two hundred eighty-seven participants completed all of the evaluations. The most common faulty posture was uneven shoulder level (36%), followed by forward head posture (25%). There was a sex difference between groups. The incidence of forward head posture for the male students was higher than that of the female students (P < .0001). In addition, the high psychologic distress group tended to have a higher prevalence of uneven shoulder height than that of the low psychologic distress group (P < .0001). As for the correlation analysis, the researchers did not find a high correlation among the scores of the faulty posture, psychologic distress, and musculoskeletal symptoms.\nConclusion: The results of this study show that the incidence of faulty posture was high for the adolescent group, especially for the uneven shoulder level. Subjects' awareness about being assessed might decrease the incidence for some faulty posture. However, the relationships among the number of faulty postures, psychologic distress, and musculoskeletal symptoms were low. We suggest that there are multiple factors that might contribute to musculoskeletal symptoms; faulty posture could be one important factor that causes symptoms."

Free stance was followed by weight bearing, lowering or raising the center of gravity (COG) by 10%. Next, a book was balanced on the head and finally, forward inclination was constrained. Normal stance strategy, including predictive muscle responses was found during free stance. Modifying COG height caused little response changes. Stance strategy became abnormal when head trajectory or forward inclination was restricted, indicating that ability to generate a nonstandard multi-joint stance strategy, rather than production of adequate stabilizing forces, is impaired in moderate, medicated PD patients."

  "abstract": "The elderly population is growing rapidly. Fall related injuries are a central problem for this population. Elderly people desire to live at home, and thus, new technologies, such as automated fall detectors, are needed to support their independence and security. The aim of this study was to evaluate different low-complexity fall detection algorithms, using triaxial accelerometers attached at the waist, wrist, and head. The fall data were obtained from standardized types of intentional falls (forward, backward, and lateral) in three middle-aged subjects. Data from activities of daily living were used as reference. Three different detection algorithms with increasing complexity were investigated using two or more of the following phases of a fall event: beginning of the fall, falling velocity, fall impact, and posture after the fall. The results indicated that fall detection using a triaxial accelerometer worn at the waist or head is efficient, even with quite simple threshold-based algorithms, with a sensitivity of 97-98% and specificity of 100%. The most sensitive acceleration parameters in these algorithms appeared to be the resultant signal with no high-pass filtering, and the calculated vertical acceleration. In this study, the wrist did not appear to be an applicable site for fall detection. Since a head worn device includes limitations concerning usability and acceptance, a waist worn accelerometer, using an algorithm that recognizes the impact and the posture after the fall, might be optimal for fall detection."

  "date": "2007 May 4",
  "abstract": "A fundamental question in neuroscience is how the brain transforms visual signals into accurate three-dimensional (3-D) reach commands, but surprisingly this has never been formally modeled. Here, we developed such a model and tested its predictions experimentally in humans. Our visuomotor transformation model used visual information about current hand and desired target positions to compute the visual (gaze-centered) desired movement vector. It then transformed these eye-centered plans into shoulder-centered motor plans using extraretinal eye and head position signals accounting for the complete 3-D eye-in-head and head-on-shoulder geometry (i.e., translation and rotation). We compared actual memory-guided reaching performance to the predictions of the model. By removing extraretinal signals (i.e., eye-head rotations and the offset between the centers of rotation of the eye and head) from the model, we developed a compensation index describing how accurately the brain performs the 3-D visuomotor transformation for different head-restrained and head-unrestrained gaze positions as well as for eye and head roll. Overall, subjects did not show errors predicted when extraretinal signals were ignored. Their reaching performance was accurate and the compensation index revealed that subjects accounted for the 3-D visuomotor transformation geometry. This was also the case for the initial portion of the movement (before proprioceptive feedback) indicating that the desired reach plan is computed in a feed-forward fashion. These findings show that the visuomotor transformation for reaching implements an internal model of the complete eye-to-shoulder linkage geometry and does not only rely on feedback control mechanisms. We discuss the relevance of this model in predicting reaching behavior in several patient groups."

  "title": "Head and neck position sense",
  "date": "2008",
  "abstract": "Traumatic minor cervical strains are common place in high-impact sports (e.g. tackling) and premature degenerative changes have been documented in sports people exposed to recurrent impact trauma (e.g. scrummaging in rugby) or repetitive forces (e.g. Formula 1 racing drivers, jockeys). While proprioceptive exercises have been an integral part of rehabilitation of injuries in the lower limb, they have not featured as prominently in the treatment of cervical injuries. However, head and neck position sense (HNPS) testing and re-training may have relevance in the management of minor sports-related neck injuries, and play a role in reducing the incidence of ongoing pain and problems with function. For efficacious programmes to be developed and tested, fundamental principles associated with proprioception in the cervical spine should be considered. Hence, this article highlights the importance of anatomical structures in the cervical spine responsible for position sense, and how their interaction with the CNS affects our ability to plan and execute effective purposeful movements. This article includes a review of studies examining position sense in subjects with and without pathology and describes the effects of rehabilitation programmes that have sought to improve position sense. In respect to the receptors providing proprioceptive information for the CNS, the high densities and complex arrays of spindles found in cervical muscles suggest that these receptors play a key role. There is some evidence suggesting that ensemble encoding of discharge patterns from muscle spindles is relayed to the CNS and that a pattern recognition system is used to establish joint position and movement. Sensory information from neck proprioceptive receptors is processed in tandem with information from the vestibular system. There are extensive anatomical connections between neck proprioceptive inputs and vestibular inputs. If positional information from the vestibular system is inaccurate or fails to be appropriately integrated in the CNS, errors in head position may occur, resulting in an inaccurate reference for HNPS, and conversely if neck proprioceptive information is inaccurate, then control of head position may be affected. The cerebellum and cortex also play a role in control of head position, providing feed-forward and modulatory influences depending on the task requirements. Position-matching tasks have been the most popular means of testing position sense in the cervical spine. These allow the appreciation of absolute, constant and variable errors in positioning and have been shown to be reliable. The results of such tests indicate that errors are relatively low (2-5 degrees). It is apparent that error is not consistently affected by age, a finding similar to studies undertaken in peripheral joints. Furthermore, the range of motion in which subjects are tested does not consistently affect accuracy in a predictable manner. However, it is evident that impairments in position sense are observed in individuals who have experienced whiplash-type injuries and individuals with chronic head and neck pain of non-traumatic origin (e.g. cervical spondylosis). While researchers advocate comprehensive retraining protocols, which include eye and neck motion targeting tasks and coordination exercises, as well as co-contraction exercises to reduce such impairments, some studies show that more general exercises and manipulation may be of benefit. Overall, there is limited information concerning the efficacy of treatment programmes."

  "date": "2007",
  "abstract": "To investigate the vestibular and somatosensory interaction in human postural control, a galvanic vestibular stimulation of cosine bell shape resulting in a small forward or backward body lean was paired with three vibrations of both soleus muscles. The induced body lean was registered by the position of the center of foot pressure (CoP). During a quiet stance with eyes closed the vibration of both soleus muscles with frequency (of) 40 Hz, 60 Hz and 80 Hz resulted in the body lean backward with velocities related to the vibration frequencies. The vestibular galvanic stimulation with the head turned to the right caused forward or backward modification of CoP backward response to the soleus muscles vibration and peaked at 1.5-2 s following the onset of the vibration. The effect of the paired stimulation was larger than the summation of the vestibular stimulation during the quiet stance and a leg muscle vibration alone. The enhancement of the galvanic stimulation was related to the velocity of body lean induced by the leg muscle vibration. The galvanic vestibular stimulation during a faster body movement had larger effects than during a slow body lean or the quiet stance. The results suggest that velocity of a body postural movement or incoming proprioceptive signal from postural muscles potentiate the effects of simultaneous vestibular stimulations on posture."

  "date": "2008",
  "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigates the influence of the forward head posture, balance confidence, and physical activity levels on balance stability in healthy community living older women.\nMethods: This descriptive study included 203 women volunteers [age range: 60 to 95 years, mean age of 77.33 years (SD 7.59)]. Forward head position (FHP) was assessed via photographic analysis of a sagittal photo taken during the seventh task of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Each subject completed the Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). Balance stability was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Data analysis included descriptive indices, bivariate correlations, and regression analyses to determine the best predictor of balance stability.\nResults: Known risk factors for balance deficits (balance confidence and physical activity) were significantly positively correlated, and age was inversely related to these factors. Forward head posture was significantly negatively related to the known risk factors but positively correlated to age. Regression analyses identified balance confidence, physical activity, and age as significant predictors of balance stability accounting for 43% (p < .0001) of the total variance in balance stability. The forward head posture variable added a significant 6.1% (p < .0001) to the total variance in balance stability, suggesting that the forward head posture plays role in balance stability.\nConclusions: The forward head posture-balance stability relationship found in this population of healthy community-dwelling older women, provides evidence to support inclusion of postural exercises for head position in balance training programs. Additionally, this research further supported the relationships between balance stability and balance confidence and physical activity. Further research is needed in the domain of intervention studies which incorporate these variables."

  "date": "2008",
  "abstract": "Deaths in a head-down position, mostly accidental events, are rare deaths in which a victim is found in an inverted body posture, with marked congestion of dependent body parts and no definite pathoanatomical cause of death. Such an exclusion diagnosis can only be put forward after elimination of other possible causes of death, following a scene investigation, medical record review, complete autopsy, and toxicological analysis. Particular attention should be taken not to confuse deaths by head-down position from the more usual positional asphyxia. We here report the case of an 82-year-old woman found stuck in the railings of the staircase leading to her house, her body freely suspended downward below the stairs. Death was finally attributed to a head-down position when correlating the autopsy findings with elements from the scene. Case reports of death by head-down position in the literature are reviewed. Furthermore, results from human experimental studies of head-down tilt are compiled. This systematic review allows an interesting insight into the physiopathology of those deaths, pointing more toward heart failure than to an asphyxial phenomenon per se."

The primary outcome measure was intensity of jaw pain on a numerical graphic rating scale (NGRS). Secondary outcome measures were jaw pain on a verbal rating scale (VRS), neck pain (NGRS and VRS), and change in head posture. Twenty-one subjects per group resulted in 80% power to detect a difference of 2 in the NGRS for intensity of jaw pain. Alpha was set at .05 for statistical significance.\nResults: Both groups showed significant statistical (P = .001) and clinical (> 2 on NGRS) improvement in jaw pain intensity. Jaw pain and neck pain improved significantly (P < .01) in both groups. There were no differences between groups for any of the measures. A significant change in head posture was not detected in either group.\nConclusion: The 6 x 6 exercises were not significantly more beneficial in reducing the intensity of jaw and neck pain than self-care alone. Furthermore, they were not beneficial in improving head posture within the 4-week duration of this study."

The aim of the present pilot study was to determine acceleration thresholds for fall detection, using triaxial accelerometric measurements at the waist, wrist, and head. Intentional falls (forward, backward, and lateral) and activities of daily living (ADL) were performed by two voluntary subjects. The results showed that measurements from the waist and head have potential to distinguish between falls and ADL. Especially, when the simple threshold-based detection was combined with posture detection after the fall, the sensitivity and specificity of fall detection were up to 100 %. On the contrary, the wrist did not appear to be an optimal site for fall detection."

  "abstract": "We present a psychology-inspired approach for generating a character' s anticipation of and response to an impending head or upper body impact. Protective anticipatory movement is built upon several actions that have been identified in the psychology literature as response mechanisms in monkeys and in humans. These actions are parameterized by a model of the approaching object (the threat) and are defined as procedural rules. We present a hybrid forward and inverse kinematic blending technique to guide the character to the pose that results from these rules while maintaining properties of a balanced posture as well as characteristics of the behavior just prior to the interaction. In our case, these characteristics are determined by a motion capture sequence. We combine our anticipation model with a physically-based dynamic response to produce animations where a character anticipates an impact before collision and reacts to the contact, physically, after the collision. We present a variety of examples including threats that vary in approach direction, size and speed."

  "title": "Virtual reality applications in improving postural control and minimizing falls",
  "date": "2006",
  "abstract": "Maintaining balance under all conditions is an absolute requirement for humans. Orientation in space and balance maintenance requires inputs from the vestibular, the visual, the proprioceptive and the somatosensory systems. All the cues coming from these systems are integrated by the central nervous system (CNS) to employ different strategies for orientation and balance. How the CNS integrates all the inputs and makes cognitive decisions about balance strategies has been an area of interest for biomedical engineers for a long time. More interesting is the fact that in the absence of one or more cues, or when the input from one of the sensors is skewed, the CNS \"adapts\" to the new environment and gives less weight to the conflicting inputs [1]. The focus of this paper is a review of different strategies and models put forward by researchers to explain the integration of these sensory cues. Also, the paper compares the different approaches used by young and old adults in maintaining balance. Since with age the musculoskeletal, visual and vestibular system deteriorates, the older subjects have to compensate for these impaired sensory cues for postural stability. The paper also discusses the applications of virtual reality in rehabilitation programs not only for balance in the elderly but also in occupational falls. Virtual reality has profound applications in the field of balance rehabilitation and training because of its relatively low cost. Studies will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality training in modifying the head and eye movement strategies, and determine the role of these responses in the maintenance of balance."

  "title": "Differences in spatial-temporal parameters and arm-leg coordination in butterfly stroke as a function of race pace, skill and gender",
  "date": "2008 Feb",
  "abstract": "Spatial-temporal parameters (velocity, stroke rate, stroke length) and arm-leg coordination in the butterfly stroke were studied as a function of race pace, skill (due to technical level, age, and experience) and gender. Forty swimmers (ten elite men, ten elite women, ten less-skilled men, and ten less-skilled women) performed the butterfly stroke at four velocities corresponding to the appropriate paces for the 400-m, 200-m, 100-m, and 50-m, respectively. Arm and leg stroke phases were identified by video analysis and used to calculate four time gaps (T1: the time difference between the start of the arms' catch phase and the start of the legs' downward phase of the first leg kick; T2: the time difference between the start of the arms' pull phase and the start of the legs' upward phase of the first leg kick; T3: the time difference between the start of the arms' push phase and the start of the legs' downward phase of the second leg kick; and T4: the time difference between the start of the arms' recovery and the start of the legs' upward phase of the second leg kick) and the total time gap (TTG), i.e., the sum of the four discrete time gaps. These values described the changing coupling of arm to leg actions over an entire stroke cycle. A significant race pace effect indicated that the synchronization between the key motor points of the arms and legs, which determine the starts and ends of the arm and leg stroke phases, increased with pace for all participants. A significant skill effect indicated that the elite swimmers had greater velocity, stroke length, and stroke rate and stronger synchronization of the arm and leg stroke phases than the less-skilled swimmers, due to smaller T2 and T3 and greater T1. A significant gender effect revealed greater velocity and stroke length for the men, and smaller T1 for the less-skilled women. These time gap differences between skill levels were related to the capacity of elite swimmers to assume a more streamlined position of trunk, head and upper limbs during leg actions, adopt a shorter glide and higher stroke rate to overcome great forward resistance, and generate higher forces and use better technique during the arm pull. Thus, coaches are advised to begin monitoring arm-leg coordination earlier in swimmers' careers to ensure that they attain their highest possible skill levels."

  "date": "2007 Sep",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare selected kinematic variables of the front foot off-drive in skilled and less-skilled cricket batsmen. High-speed digital cameras were used to record the three-dimensional kinematics of 10 skilled and 10 less-skilled right-handed batsmen when playing a shadow front foot off-drive to realistic projected video footage. Skilled batsmen were more likely to identify the type of delivery bowled. Seventy percent of skilled batsmen had preparatory feet or foot movement before committing to play forward, while only 20% of the less-skilled batsmen utilized this trigger movement. Throughout the drive, the head of the skilled batsmen was further forward of the centre base point than that of the less-skilled batsmen. This forward head position was associated with the tendency for the skilled batsmen's centre of mass to be further forward during the predicted bat-ball contact. There were no significant differences between groups in the shoulder angle, bat angle or bat speed during the different phases of the stroke. There was a tendency for the less-skilled batsmen to have a larger hip angle at contact. This study provides further understanding of the factors associated with skilled performance in cricket batting, which coaches should consider when training less-skilled performers."

  "date": "2007 Dec",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if a change in forward head posture and occipital extension occurred in participants who wore multifocal lenses vs. those persons with non-multifocal lenses while performing an 8-min visual reading task on a visual display unit (VDU). Forty-two healthy human participants were recruited for this study. Thirty-three participants completed the study. Fourteen participants wore multifocal lenses and 19 wore frames with non-multifocal lenses. To evaluate the degree of change of forward head posture and occipital extension digital photographs of cervical posture were taken at four different time intervals: prior to performing the reading task and at 3, 5 and 8 min during the reading task. The digital photographs were analysed utilizing a computer program. Two one-way ANOVA were utilized to determine the degree of change of forward head posture and occipital extension between groups. A significant difference was identified between groups for changes in degrees of forward head posture while performing a visual reading task on a VDU. However, no significant difference between groups was found for occipital extension while performing the same task. Multifocal wearers exhibit greater degrees of change in forward head posture and occipital extension than non-multifocal wearers. These postural changes may place them at a greater risk for musculoskeletal disorders and headaches."

  "date": "2007 Oct",
  "abstract": "Introduction: The mouth breathing resulting from nasal obstruction has been highly incident, mostly as a consequence of allergic rhinitis. In children, such condition is more concerned because it causes alteration during their development, which may generate deformities.\nObjective: To evaluate the efficacy of a program of combined postural exercise and breathing, on the cervical muscles and body posture in school-age mouth breathing children.\nMaterials and methods: Nineteen mouth breathing children, mean age of 10.6 years, both genders, were recruited either from a public school or from a speech-therapy service. The evaluation procedures were electromyographic recordings from the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), sub-occipitals (SOC) and upper trapezius (UT) muscles and computerized photographic analysis pre and post-treatment. The subjects were submitted to a 12-week of a Physical Therapy Program (PTP) consisted by (a) muscular stretching and strengthening exercises using a Swiss ball combined to (b) naso-diaphragmatic re-education.\nResults: There was a significant reduction (p<0.05) in the electrical activity on the assessed muscles during quiet position (5, 19 and 7.1% to 3, 2 and 10.3% for SCM, SOC and UT, respectively) and aligned posture (7, 19 and 8% to 4, 9 and 2.6% for SCM, SOC and UT, respectively) after treatment. Improvement in the postural deviation, especially reduction in forward head posture and abducted scapula were demonstrated in the computerized photographic analysis.\nConclusion: A combination of postural and breathing exercises was effective in restoring muscle imbalances and posture in a group of school-age mouth breathing children, as measured by changes in electrical activity and positional data."

  "title": "The effect of speed and influence of individual muscles on hamstring mechanics during the swing phase of sprinting",
  "date": "2007",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the effect of speed and influence of individual muscles on hamstring stretch, loading, and work during the swing phase of sprinting. We measured three-dimensional kinematics and electromyography (EMG) activities of 19 athletes sprinting on a treadmill at speeds ranging from 80% to 100% of maximum speed. We then generated muscle-actuated forward dynamic simulations of swing and double float phases of the sprinting gait cycle. Simulated lower extremity joint angles and model predicted excitations were similar to measured quantities. Swing phase simulations were used to characterize the effects of speed on the peak stretch, maximum force, and negative work of the biceps femoris long head (BF), the most often injured hamstring muscle. Perturbations of the double float simulations were used to assess the influence of individual muscles on BF stretch. Peak hamstring musculotendon stretch occurred at approximately 90% of the gait cycle (late swing) and was independent of speed. Peak hamstring force and negative musculotendon work increased significantly with speed (p<0.05). Muscles in the lumbo-pelvic region had greater influence on hamstring stretch than muscles acting about the knee and ankle. In particular, the hip flexors were found to induce substantial hamstring stretch in the opposite limb, with that influence increasing with running speed. We conclude that hamstring strain injury during sprinting may be related to the performance of large amounts of negative work over repeated strides and/or resulting from a perturbation in pelvic muscle coordination that induces excessive hamstring stretch in a single stride."

  "title": "Anticipatory control of head posture",
  "date": "2007 Aug",
  "abstract": "Objective: We tested a hypothesis on two patterns of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) in neck muscles, reciprocal and co-activation, that may be used in a task-specific way. We also explored possible relation of APAs in leg and trunk muscles to head stabilization.\nMethods: Load perturbations (loading and unloading) were applied to the head, trunk, and head and trunk simultaneously using similar hand actions by standing persons. Electromyographic signals (EMGs) from 10 muscles were recorded. Shifts of the center of pressure and EMG indices were computed over typical time intervals for APA.\nResults: Time-shifted (reciprocal) activation of neck flexor and extensor muscles during APAs was seen when perturbations were applied directly to the head. Simultaneous activation dominated when the perturbations were applied to the trunk. Minimal APAs were seen in the leg/trunk muscles during head perturbation tests. APAs during trunk perturbation were not different from those during trunk and head perturbation.\nConclusions: The results confirm the existence of two different patterns of APAs in neck muscles. A time-shifted (reciprocal) pattern is more likely to be used in anticipation of a perturbation acting directly on the head. A simultaneous activation (co-activation) pattern is used when direction of head perturbation cannot be predicted with certainty. Leg/trunk APAs are unlikely to help stabilize head posture.\nSignificance: These results are important for better understanding of feed-forward mechanisms of the control of head posture with possible implications for neurological patients who suffer from impaired feed-forward postural control."

  "abstract": "Objective: To assess the differences in the presence of trigger points (TrPs) in head and neck muscles, forward head posture (FHP) and neck mobility between episodic tension-type headache (ETTH) subjects and healthy controls. In addition, we assess the relationship between these muscle TrPs, FHP, neck mobility, and several clinical variables concerning the intensity and the temporal profile of headache.\nBackground: TTH is a headache in which musculoskeletal disorders of the craniocervical region might play an important role in its pathogenesis. Design.-A blinded, controlled pilot study.\nMethods: Fifteen ETTH subjects and 15 matched controls without headache were studied. TrPs in both upper trapezius, both sternocleidomastoids, and both temporalis muscles were identified according to Simons and Gerwin diagnostic criteria (tenderness in a hypersensible spot within a palpable taut band, local twitch response elicited by snapping palpation, and elicited referred pain with palpation). Side-view pictures of each subject were taken in both sitting and standing positions, in order to assess FHP by measuring the craniovertebral angle. A cervical goniometer was employed to measure neck mobility. All measures were taken by a blinded assessor. A headache diary was kept for 4 weeks in order to assess headache intensity, frequency, and duration.\nResults: The mean number of TrPs for each ETTH subject was 3.7 (SD: 1.3), of which 1.9 (SD: 0.9) were active, and 1.8 (SD: 0.9) were latent. Control subjects only had latent TrPs (mean: 1.5; SD: 1). TrP occurrence between the 2 groups was significantly different for active TrPs (P < .001), but not for latent TrPs (P > .05). Differences in the distribution of TrPs were significant for the right upper trapezius muscles (P= .04), the left sternocleidomastoid (P= .03), and both temporalis muscles (P < .001). Within the ETTH group, headache intensity, frequency, and duration outcomes did not differ depending on TrP activity, whether the TrP was active or latent. The craniovertebral angle was smaller, ie, there was a greater FHP, in ETTH patients than in healthy controls for both sitting and standing positions (P < .05). ETTH subjects with active TrPs in the analyzed muscles had a greater FHP than those with latent TrPs in both sitting and standing positions, though differences were only significant for certain muscles. Finally, ETTH patients also showed lesser neck mobility than healthy controls in the total range of motion as well as in half-cycles (except for cervical extension), although neck mobility did not seem to influence headache parameters.\nConclusions: Active TrPs in the upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and temporalis muscles were more common in ETTH subjects than in healthy controls, although TrP activity was not related to any clinical variable concerning the intensity and the temporal profile of headache. ETTH patients showed greater FHP and lesser neck mobility than healthy controls, although both disorders were not correlated with headache parameters."

  "date": "2001 Nov",
  "abstract": "A BioRID II dummy and a Hybrid III dummy, each representative of a midsize adult male, were tested side-by-side in simulated rear-impact sled tests. In all tests the dummies were restrained by 3-point belt systems. The results of 4 test sets conducted at a nominal change in velocity (deltaV) of 16 km/hr are presented and discussed. In three of the test sets, bucket seats were used. The head restraints were placed in the up-position in two of the three test sets and in the down-position in the third set of tests. In the fourth test set, rigid seats without any head restraints were used. While analyzing the BioRID II data, the presence of an axial neck load acting on the head, which bypassed the upper neck load transducer, was discovered in all the reported tests. The implication of this observation is that the axial force and all the moments measured by the BioRID II upper neck load transducer could be erroneous. A second concern with the BioRID II data was the high frequency noise observed, especially on the T1 acceleration response which is used in the NIC calculation. The 18 Hz filter used to process the T1 acceleration data for the NIC calculation attenuated the peak NIC values by 15% as compared to the SAE 180 filtered values. The unmeasured neck loads and high-frequency noise issues need to be resolved before additional BioRID II testing is done. A third concern with the BioRID II is the initial position of its head in the automotive seating posture. It is higher and more forward than that of the 50(th) percentile adult male."

  "title": "Evaluating the relationships between the postural adaptation of patients with profound cerebral palsy and the configuration of the Seating Buggy's seating support surface",
  "date": "2007 Mar",
  "abstract": "We are currently investigating the physiological polymorphism of wheelchair users with profound cerebral palsy and the properties of the Seating Buggy (developed by S. Nishimura, 1998) to clarify important and general elements of wheelchairs for widespread use. Cerebral palsy is a diagnostic term used to describe a group of motor syndromes resulting from disorders in early brain development. Recently, it has been shown that the Seating Buggy produces functional head-neck alignments and active control of sitting balance for people with profound cerebral palsy. The Seating Buggy is a wheelchair for the profoundly disabled and features a wide adjustment range from heights of 120 cm to 175 cm. Its seating support surface is comprised of a sling-seat. To examine the relationships between the postural adaptation of patients with profound cerebral palsy and the configuration of the Seating Buggy's seating, we assessed the postural alignment of the Seating Buggy's user and then measured the configuration of its resulting seating support surface with a three dimensional scanning system. Twenty-one subjects were used for the purposes of this investigation in their everyday environment. Postural adaptation and wheelchair fitting in the Seating Buggy were assessed from the viewpoint of the Active Balanced Seating by a seating expert. The subjects fell into two categories, as follows: 11 for appropriate or nearly appropriate fitting, and 10 for ill-fitting. The depth of thoracic support and the forward distance of lumbar support for those who claimed that it was ill-fitting were significantly reduced compared with that of those who claimed that the Seating Buggy offered an appropriate or nearly appropriate fitting. It was suggested that the properly adjusted depth of thoracic support and distance of the lumbar support were related to the resulting satisfactory head-neck alignment and sitting balance of the patients with profound cerebral palsy."

  "date": "2004 Dec",
  "abstract": "A study was conducted to determine the effects of VDT monitor positions and the use of single vision versus bifocal glasses on somatic elements in the data entry task. Eight male subjects performed data entry using a word processor in eight half-hour sessions with the four different monitor placements, i.e. \"eye-level\", \"shoulder-level-front\", \"shoulder-level-side\", and \"sunken-level\", wearing the two types of glasses. A subjective discomfort rating questionnaire covering 12 somatic elements was completed by the subject after each session. The head inclination and angle of gaze to the monitor were measured with a goniometer. The results revealed that the somatic elements which were affected significantly by the placement of the VDT monitor and the type of glasses were discomfort in the neck and back regions and eyestrain, respectively. The neck-back discomfort scores were highest at the \"eye-level\", lowest at the \"sunken-level\", and intermediate at the \"shoulder-level-side\" position. The \"shoulder-level-front\" position was not significantly different in the discomfort from other three positions. The eyestrain was significantly greater with the bifocal than with the single vision glasses. The lower the monitor was placed, the more forward was the head and gaze inclined. The head was inclined less forward, or even more backward, and the gaze was inclined more forward, with the bifocal than with the single vision glasses. As a conclusion, the VDT operators were advised to avoid the \"eye-level\" and \"shoulder-level-side\" positions and to prefer the \"sunken-level\" and \"shoulder-level-front\" positions as the first and second best choices, respectively. The preference becomes more critical for the wearers of bifocal glasses that suffer from postural constraints in viewing."

  "date": "2006 Aug",
  "abstract": "Reasons for performing study: In many equestrian activities a specific position of head and/or neck is required that is dissimilar to the natural position. There is controversy about the effects of these positions on locomotion pattern, but few quantitative data are available.\nObjectives: To quantify the effects of 5 different head and neck positions on thoracolumbar kinematics of the horse.\nMethods: Kinematics of 7 high level dressage horses were measured walking and trotting on an instrumented treadmill with the head and neck in the following positions: HNP2 = neck raised, bridge of the nose in front of the vertical; HNP3 = as HNP2 with bridge of the nose behind the vertical; HNP4 = head and neck lowered, nose behind the vertical; HNP5 = head and neck in extreme high position; HNP6 = head and neck forward and downward. HNP1 was a speed-matched control (head and neck unrestrained).\nResults: The head and neck positions affected only the flexion-extension motion. The positions in which the neck was extended (HNP2, 3, 5) increased extension in the anterior thoracic region, but increased flexion in the posterior thoracic and lumbar region. For HNP4 the pattern was the opposite. Positions 2, 3 and 5 reduced the flexion-extension range of motion (ROM) while HNP4 increased it. HNP5 was the only position that negatively affected intravertebral pattern symmetry and reduced hindlimb protraction. The stride length was significantly reduced at walk in positions 2, 3, 4 and 5.\nConclusions: There is a significant influence of head/neck position on back kinematics. Elevated head and neck induce extension in the thoracic region and flexion in the lumbar region; besides reducing the sagittal range of motion. Lowered head and neck produces the opposite. A very high position of the head and neck seems to disturb normal kinematics.\nPotential relevance: This study provides quantitative data on the effect of head/neck positions on thoracolumbar motion and may help in discussions on the ethical acceptability of some training methods."

  "abstract": "Reasons for performing study: Little is known in quantitative terms about the influence of different head-neck positions (HNPs) on the loading pattern of the locomotor apparatus. Therefore it is difficult to predict whether a specific riding technique is beneficial for the horse or if it may increase the risk for injury.\nObjective: To improve the understanding of forelimb-hindlimb balance and its underlying temporal changes in relation to different head and neck positions.\nMethods: Vertical ground reaction force and time parameters of each limb were measured in 7 high level dressage horses while being ridden at walk and trot on an instrumented treadmill in 6 predetermined HNPs: HNP1 - free, unrestrained with loose reins; HNP2 - neck raised, bridge of the nose in front of the vertical; HNP3 - neck raised, bridge of the nose behind the vertical; HNP4 - neck lowered and flexed, bridge of the nose considerably behind the vertical; HNP5 - neck extremely elevated and bridge of the nose considerably in front of the vertical; HNP6 - neck and head extended forward and downward. Positions were judged by a qualified dressage judge. HNPs were assessed by comparing the data to a velocity-matched reference HNP (HNP2). Differences were tested using paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test (P<0.05).\nResults: At the walk, stride duration and overreach distance increased in HNP1, but decreased in HNP3 and HNP5. Stride impulse was shifted to the forehand in HNP1 and HNP6, but shifted to the hindquarters in HNP5. At the trot, stride duration increased in HNP4 and HNP5. Overreach distance was shorter in HNP4. Stride impulse shifted to the hindquarters in HNP5. In HNP1 peak forces decreased in the forelimbs; in HNP5 peak forces increased in fore- and hindlimbs.\nConclusions: HNP5 had the biggest impact on limb timing and load distribution and behaved inversely to HNP1 and HNP6. Shortening of forelimb stance duration in HNP5 increased peak forces although the percentage of stride impulse carried by the forelimbs decreased.\nPotential relevance: An extremely high HNP affects functionality much more than an extremely low neck."

  "abstract": "Study design: A cross-sectional correlation study.\nObjectives: To investigate the relationship between head posture with pain and disability in patients with neck pain.\nMethod: Sixty-two subjects with neck pain and 52 normal subjects were recruited by convenience sampling. The forward head posture was measured via the craniovertebral (CV) angle by using the Head Posture Spinal Curvature Instrument (HPSCI). The Chinese version of Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) were used to assess neck pain disability and severity. The difference in CV angles between the two groups and Pearson's correlation coefficient between the CV angle, NPQ and NPRS were determined.\nResults: There was a significant difference in the CV angle between subjects with and without neck pain. CV angle was negatively correlated with NPQ (r(p)=-0.3101, p=0.015) and NPRS (r(p)=-0.329,p=0.009). It was also negatively correlated with age (r(p)=-0.380,p=0.002). When age was taken into account, the CV angle was negatively correlated with NPQ (r(p)=-0.3101,p=0.015) but showed no significant correlation with NPRS (r(p)=-0.1848,p=0.154).\nConclusion: The CV angle in subjects with neck pain is significantly smaller than that in normal subjects. There is moderate negative correlation between CV angle and neck disability. Patients with small CV angle have a greater forward head posture, and the greater the forward head posture, the greater the disability."

  "date": "2007 Feb",
  "abstract": "Design: Case-control, descriptive pilot study.\nObjective: To describe the differences in the performance of the craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) between individuals with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) and healthy controls. To assess the relationship between the CCFT, forward head posture, and several clinical variables related to the intensity and temporal profile of headache.\nBackground: Musculoskeletal impairments of the craniocervical region might play an important role on the pathogenesis of CTTH. Deficits in the performance of the CCFT have been reported in patients with cervicogenic headache, nonspecific neck pain, and whiplash injury, but not in individuals with CTTH.\nMaterial and methods: Ten patients with CTTH and 10 comparable controls without headache were studied. A headache diary was kept for 4 weeks to substantiate the diagnosis and to record the pain history. The CCFT was performed with the subject supine and required performing a gentle head-nodding action of craniocervical flexion. The activation pressure score (pressure that the subject can achieve and hold for 10 seconds), the performance pressure index (calculated by multiplying the activation pressure score by the number of successful repetitions), and the highest pressure score (the highest level that each subject was able to hold for 10 seconds from 20 to 30 mm Hg) were measured. Side-view pictures of each subject were taken in both sitting and standing positions to assess forward head posture (FHP) by measuring the craniovertebral angle. All measures were taken by an assessor blinded to the subject's condition.\nResults: Patients with CTTH had significantly lower values in both active pressure score and performance pressure index (P < .001), but not in the highest pressure score (P = .057), compared to controls. Patients with CTTH had a smaller craniovertebral angle (mean +/- SD, 42.0 degrees +/- 6.6 degrees), indicating a more FHP than controls (48.8 degrees +/- 2.5 degrees), in the standing position (P < .01); but not in the sitting position (CTTH, 39 degrees +/- 8.9 degrees; controls, 42.8 degrees +/- 8.9 degrees, P = .10). No association between FHP and any of the CCFT variables was found (P >.05). Headache intensity and frequency did not seem to be related to the CCFT variables, but there was a positive association between headache duration and activation pressure score (r(s), = 0.746, P = .02) and highest pressure score (r(s), = 0.743, P = .02).\nConclusions: These findings suggest possible impairments of the musculoskeletal system in individuals with CTTH, although it is not possible to determine if these impairments contributed to the etiology of CTTH or are as a result of the chronic headache condition."

  "date": "2007 Apr",
  "abstract": "Background and purpose: Poor sitting posture has been implicated in the development and perpetuation of neck pain symptoms. This study had 2 purposes: (1) to compare change in cervical and thoracic posture during a distracting task between subjects with chronic neck pain and control subjects and (2) to compare the effects of 2 different neck exercise regimens on the ability of people with neck pain to maintain an upright cervical and thoracic posture during this task.\nSubjects: Fifty-eight subjects with chronic, nonsevere neck pain and 10 control subjects participated in the study.\nMethod: Change in cervical and thoracic posture from an upright posture was measured every 2 minutes during a 10-minute computer task. Following baseline measurements, the subjects with neck pain were randomized into one of two 6-week exercise intervention groups: a group that received training of the craniocervical flexor muscles or a group that received endurance-strength training of the cervical flexor muscles. The primary outcomes following intervention were changes in the angle of cervical and thoracic posture during the computer task.\nResults: Subjects with neck pain demonstrated a change in cervical angle across the duration of the task (mean=4.4 degrees ; 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.3-5.4), consistent with a more forward head posture. No significant difference was observed for the change in cervical angle across the duration of the task for the control group subjects (mean=2.2 degrees ; 95% CI=1.0-3.4). Following intervention, the craniocervical flexor training group demonstrated a significant reduction in the change of cervical angle across the duration of the computer task.\nDiscussion and conclusion: This study showed that people with chronic neck pain demonstrate a reduced ability to maintain an upright posture when distracted. Following intervention with an exercise program targeted at training the craniocervical flexor muscles, subjects with neck pain demonstrated an improved ability to maintain a neutral cervical posture during prolonged sitting."

  "title": "Validity of a computer postural analysis to estimate 3-dimensional rotations and translations of the head from three 2-dimensional digital images",
  "date": "2007 Feb",
  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate the validity/accuracy of the computerized system PosturePrint for measuring head posture.\nMethods: Computer analysis was compared with 125 measured positions of a mannequin head in 5 degrees of freedom. For each mannequin position, 3 digital photographs were obtained (left lateral, anteroposterior, and right lateral) and were processed through the PosturePrint computer system. For the head analysis, a headgear with 3 reflective markers was placed on a subject; and there were additional click-on markers at the ear tragus, upper lip, acromioclavicular joints, and episternal notch. Head postures were calculated as lateral translation (T(x)), lateral flexion (R(z)), axial rotation (R(y)), flexion-extension (R(x)), and anterior-posterior translation (T(z)). For an error analysis, PosturePrint algorithm calculations were compared with the true mannequin head positions. Furthermore, average head posture was determined in student volunteers (n = 40).\nResults: Mean computational errors were R(x) = 1.3 degrees (SD 0.6 degrees) and T(z) = 1.1 mm (SD 0.5 mm) for sagittal displacements and R(y) = 1.1 degrees (SD 0.7 degrees), R(z) = 0.6 degrees (SD 0.4 degrees), and T(x) = 1.1 mm (SD 0.5 mm) for frontal view displacements. For the normal group, mean head displacements were 1.1 degrees or less for all rotations and 1 mm or less for lateral translations (T(x)); and forward head posture (T(z)) averaged 3 cm.\nConclusion: From the mannequin positions, small mean errors indicate that the PosturePrint system is accurate. In the future, statistical research determining the correlation between head displacements, neck pain, function, and health status should be performed."

  "title": "Improved positioning procedures for 6YO and 10YO ATDs based on child occupant postures",
  "date": "2006 Nov",
  "abstract": "The outcomes of crash tests can be influenced by the initial posture and position of the anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) used to represent human occupants. In previous work, positioning procedures for ATDs representing adult drivers and rear-seat passengers have been developed through analysis of posture data from human volunteers. The present study applied the same methodology to the development of positioning procedures for ATDs representing six-year-old and ten-year-old children sitting on vehicle seats and belt-positioning boosters. Data from a recent study of 62 children with body mass from 18 to 45 kg were analyzed to quantify hip and head locations and pelvis and head angles for both sitter-selected and standardized postures. In the present study, the 6YO and 10YO Hybrid-III ATDs were installed using FMVSS 213 procedures in six test conditions used previously with children. Data were gathered on a vehicle seat with and without a backless belt-positioning booster at 19-, 23-, and 27-degree seat back angles. The data analysis showed that children sat with their hips further forward and with more reclined pelvis orientations in the sitter-selected posture than in the standardized posture. On the booster, the 6YO ATD head and pelvis positions and orientations corresponded well to the data from similar-size children seated in the standardized posture on the booster, but the 6YO ATD pelvis was about 20 mm rearward of the expected location for similar size children on the booster in sitter-selected postures, and the ATD head was about 20 mm higher than the expected location. Without the booster, the average 6YO ATD hip location was 40 mm rearward of the expected location in sitter-selected postures and the ATD head was 40 mm above the heads of similar-size children. The trends for the 10YO ATD hip- and head-location trends were similar, but the 10YO head was substantially forward of the head locations of similar-size children. Based on these findings, the current ATD positioning procedure was modified by inserting a foam block behind the pelvis and adjusting the 10YO ATD neck angle. A preliminary evaluation using the 10YO ATD indicates that the new procedure produces ATD postures that better represent child passenger postures with respect to hip and head locations and pelvis and head angles."

  "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether improvements in flexed posture, strength, range of motion (ROM), and physical performance would be observed after 12 weeks of group exercise in older women who because of age are prone to flexed posture and impaired physical function.\nDesign: Pretest-posttest of outcome measures.\nSetting: Outpatient academic medical center.\nParticipants: Twenty-one women with thoracic kyphosis of 50 degrees or greater.\nIntervention: Multidimensional group exercise performed 2 times a week for 12 weeks.\nMain outcome measures: Primary dependent measures of flexed posture included kyphosis, forward head, and height. Other dependent measures included spinal extensor muscle strength; shoulder, hip, and knee ROM; balance; modified Physical Performance Test (PPT); jug test; and gait speed.\nResults: Baseline kyphosis was 57 degrees +/-5.0 degrees , and age was 72.0+/-4.2 years. There were significant improvements in usual (-6 degrees +/-3 degrees ) and best kyphosis (-5 degrees +/-3 degrees ) (P<.001), spinal extensor muscle strength (21%+/-13% of peak torque/body weight, P<.001), popliteal angle (right, 7 degrees +/-7 degrees ; left, 9 degrees +/-10 degrees ; P<.001), modified PPT (2+/-2 points, P<.001), and jug test (-1.4+/-1.3s, P<.001). Age and modified PPT at baseline correlated with change in kyphosis (r=0.5, P=.02; r=.42, P=.055, respectively).\nConclusions: Multidimensional group exercise reduced measured kyphosis and improved strength, ROM, and physical performance. This study provides a promising exercise intervention that may improve posture and physical performance in older women with flexed posture."

  "date": "2007 Mar 19",
  "abstract": "The present study focuses on the organization of kinematic synergy and its adaptation to an unstable support surface during upper trunk movements in aging adults. Seven healthy aging adults (49-66 years old) were instructed to bend the trunk forward (the head and the trunk together) by about 40 degrees and to stabilize their final position, in the standard condition (both feet on the ground), and on a seesaw swinging in the sagittal plane. Kinematic synergy was quantified by performing a principal components analysis on the hip, knee and ankle angle changes during the movement. The results indicate that trunk bending was represented by a single component (PC1) in both conditions, indicating a strong coupling between the angle changes during the movement. The results also show a reorganization of the contribution of PC1 to the three angles when the balance constraints are increased in the seesaw condition. It is concluded that kinematic synergy is preserved during trunk bending in aging adults, regardless of the support conditions. It can also be adapted when the balance constraints are increased by changing the ratio between the angles, indicating a modification of interjoint coordination without modifying the movement's trajectory."

  "date": "2007 Feb",
  "abstract": "The relationship between the changes in forward head posture (FHP), neck mobility and headache parameters was analysed in 25 patients with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) undergoing a physical therapy programme. Side-view pictures were taken to measure the cranio-vertebral angle in the sitting and standing positions. A cervical goniometer was employed to measure the range of all cervical motions. A headache diary was kept to assess headache intensity, frequency and duration. All patients received six sessions of physical therapy over 3 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after treatment and 1 month later. Neck mobility and headache parameters showed a significant improvement after the intervention, whereas posture changes did not reach statistical significance. No correlations were found between FHP, neck mobility and headache parameters at any stage. Changes in these outcomes throughout the study were not correlated either. FHP and neck mobility appear not to be related to headache intensity, duration or frequency in patients suffering from CTTH. Although patients showed a reduction in the range of motion in the neck, it is uncertain whether this is consistent with TTH."

  "date": "2007 Feb",
  "abstract": "Increasingly complex models of the neck neuromusculature need detailed muscle and kinematic data for proper validation. The goal of this study was to measure the electromyographic activity of superficial and deep neck muscles during tasks involving isometric, voluntary, and reflexively evoked contractions of the neck muscles. Three male subjects (28-41 years) had electromyographic (EMG) fine wires inserted into the left sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, trapezius, splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, and multifidus muscles. Surface electrodes were placed over the left sternohyoid muscle. Subjects then performed: (i) maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) in the eight directions (45 deg intervals) from the neutral posture; (ii) 50 N isometric contractions with a slow sweep of the force direction through 720 deg; (iii) voluntary oscillatory head movements in flexion and extension; and (iv) initially relaxed reflex muscle activations to a forward acceleration while seated on a sled. Isometric contractions were performed against an overhead load cell and movement dynamics were measured using six-axis accelerometry on the head and torso. In all three subjects, the two anterior neck muscles had similar preferred activation directions and acted synergistically in both dynamic tasks. With the exception of splenius capitis, the posterior and posterolateral neck muscles also showed consistent activation directions and acted synergistically during the voluntary motions, but not during the sled perturbations. These findings suggest that the common numerical-modeling assumption that all anterior muscles act synergistically as flexors is reasonable, but that the related assumption that all posterior muscles act synergistically as extensors is not. Despite the small number of subjects, the data presented here can be used to inform and validate a neck model at three levels of increasing neuromuscular-kinematic complexity: muscles generating forces with no movement, muscles generating forces and causing movement, and muscles generating forces in response to induced movement. These increasingly complex data sets will allow researchers to incrementally tune their neck models' muscle geometry, physiology, and feedforward/feedback neuromechanics."

This study evaluates, in a prospective cohort design, the effect of mandibular advancement splints (MAS) on awake genioglossus (GG), geniohyoid (GH) and masseter (M) muscle activity.\nMethods: Fifty OSA patients received a custom-made removable Herbst MAS appliance, adjusted for maximum therapeutic benefit, as judged by subjective improvement. Awake electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded at baseline and with the MAS in situ, by using bipolar surface electrodes in patients seated upright and in the natural head position. The lower splint was modified to facilitate the placement of the intra-oral bipolar surface electrodes used to record GG EMG activity.\nResults: Significant increases in GG (P = 0.041), GH (P<0.001) and M (P<0.001) muscle activity accompanied placement of the MAS.\nConclusions: These findings support the contention of a physiological role, which may act to augment the anatomical action of MAS."

  "title": "Quantitative analysis of the ankle strategy under translational platform disturbance",
  "date": "2006 Dec",
  "abstract": "The ankle strategy is one of the postural adjustment maneuvers humans utilize when the support platform is disturbed. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the ankle strategy. A three-link sagittal biped model is considered. The first link represents the two legs locked together. The second link represents the two thighs locked together. The third link represents the hip, the torso, the upper limbs, the neck, and the head. The dynamics, control, and stability of the three-link biped, under platform translation, are considered. The disturbance of the platform is represented as an input and the effect of the muscular system is reduced to a set of torques applied to the joints and across the joints. Two digital computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the biped under backward or forward platform disturbance. The simulations are compared with experimental measurements of humans subjected to postural disturbances. It is shown that the effect of a horizontal disturbance at the ankle appears to be about 40 times that of the effect of the disturbance at the knees and at least a few hundred times larger than the effect of a disturbance at the hip. This means that, under translational platform disturbance, the ankle angle is subjected to the largest excursion. The knee and the hip angle excursions are relatively minor. Consequently, the biped, as a whole, appears to move as a single inverted pendulum. Major postural corrections are initiated by the ankle excursion. Further, when the available ankle torque is limited or nonexistent, the stability requires resorting to the knee or hip strategies."

  "date": "2007 Feb 14",
  "abstract": "It has been proposed that an internal representation of body vertical has a prominent role in spatial orientation. This investigation investigated the ability of human subjects to accurately locate their longitudinal body axis (an imaginary straight body midline running from head to toes) while free-floating in microgravity. Subjects were tested in-flight, as well as on ground in normal gravity in both the upright and supine orientations to provide baseline measurements. The subjects wore a goggle device and were in total darkness. They used knobs to rotate two luminous lines until they were parallel to the subjective direction of their longitudinal body axis, in the roll (right/left) and the pitch (forward/backward) planes. Results showed that the error between the perceived and the objective direction of the longitudinal body axis was significantly larger in microgravity than in normal gravity. This error in this egocentric frame of reference is presumably due to the absence of somatosensory cues when free-floating. Mechanical pressure on the chest using an airbag reduced the error in perception of the longitudinal body axis in microgravity, thus improving spatial orientation."

  "date": "2007 Apr",
  "abstract": "Postural and startle responses rapidly habituate with repeated exposures to the same stimulus, and the first exposure to a seated forward acceleration elicits a startle response in the neck muscles. Our goal was to examine how the acoustic startle response is integrated with the habituated neck postural response elicited by forward accelerations of seated subjects. In experiment 1, 14 subjects underwent 11 sequential forward accelerations followed by 5 additional sled accelerations combined with a startling tone (124-dB sound pressure level) initiated 18 ms after sled acceleration onset. During the acceleration-only trials, changes consistent with habituation occurred in the root-mean-square amplitude of the neck muscles and in the peak amplitude of five head and torso kinematic variables. The subsequent addition of the startling tone restored the amplitude of the neck muscles and four of the five kinematic variables but shortened onset of muscle activity by 9-12 ms. These shortened onset times were further explored in experiment 2, wherein 16 subjects underwent 11 acceleration-only trials followed by 15 combined acceleration-tone trials with interstimulus delays of 0, 13, 18, 23, and 28 ms. Onset times shortened further for the 0- and 13-ms delays but did not lengthen for the 23- and 28-ms delays. These temporal and spatial changes in EMG can be explained by a summation of the excitatory drive converging at or before the neck muscle motoneurons. The present observations suggest that habituation to repeated sled accelerations involves extinguishing the startle response and tuning the postural response to the whole body disturbance."

Factors such as iris and pupillary integrity, depth of anterior chamber, gonioscopic grading, behavior of the anterior chamber on the operation table during fluid-air exchange, removal of crystalline lens or intraocular lens during surgery, and type of internal tamponade were noted. The anterior chamber was assessed postoperatively in supine and sitting position and with head bent forward. Statistical methods were used to identify risk factors for development of postoperative anterior chamber collapse using SPSS soft ware.\nResults: Anterior chamber collapse occurred in 13 eyes (3.14%). Presence of preoperative shallow anterior chamber, removal of intraocular lens as a part of the procedure, occurrence of intraoperative anterior chamber collapse, and use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) were associated with higher risk of anterior chamber collapse postoperatively.\nConclusions: The identification of potential risk factors in a given eye can alert the surgeon to the possibility of development of anterior chamber collapse postoperatively."

  "abstract": "It has been suggested that postural problems experienced by people with spinal cord injury may increase with greater age and duration of injury; however, there has been little documentation of the magnitude of changes and their time course. Our study was conducted to measure the wheelchair posture of 30 participants with long and short duration of tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury as compared to 30 age-matched able-bodied participants. Posture measurements were derived from the relationships of bony landmarks which were recorded by photography. Results suggest that increasing age and duration of spinal cord injury are associated with more extreme pelvic angle and forward head posture. Thoracic kyphosis, as indicated by chest angle, was the main postural distinction between participants with tetraplegia and able-bodied participants. The kyphosis was not significantly greater in those with longer duration injury. Proactive intervention to prevent late onset postural problems is recommended."

The pattern of head movements over time was investigated in a laboratory study with ten subjects either sleep-deprived or rested. Head movements were obtained by an inclinometer placed on the subject's forehead, and the recording was continuous. Results show that subjects when sleep-deprived moved their head more and had more extreme head movements compared to when rested. An increase of the velocity and the number of extreme head movements over time were noted when the subjects were sleep-deprived and when rested. The increase of head movements was more linear over time in the rested condition, whereas in sleep-deprived conditions most of the increase appeared during the first hour. No significant differences of between forward-backward movements and left-right movements could be found. When rested, the changes in head movements correlated with ratings of sleepiness, EEG activity, and heart rate variability. Head movements can be a used as an indicator of sleepiness."

  "date": "2006 Nov 15",
  "abstract": "Military personnel are required to carry heavy loads whilst marching; this load carriage represents a substantial component of training and combat. Studies in the literature mainly concentrate on physiological effects, with few biomechanical studies of military load carriage systems (LCS). This study examines changes in gait and posture caused by increasing load carriage in military LCS. The four conditions used during this study were control (including rifle, boots and helmet carriage, totalling 8 kg), webbing (weighing 8 kg), backpack (24 kg) and a light antitank weapon (LAW; 10 kg), resulting in an incremental increase in load carried from 8, 16, 40 to 50 kg. A total of 20 male soldiers were evaluated in the sagittal plane using a 3-D motion analysis system. Measurements of ankle, knee, femur, trunk and craniovertebral angles and spatiotemporal parameters were made during self-paced walking. Results showed spatiotemporal changes were unrelated to angular changes, perhaps a consequence of military training. Knee and femur ranges of motion (control, 21.1 degrees +/- 3.0 and 33.9 degrees +/- 7.1 respectively) increased (p < 0.05) with load (LAW, 25.5 degrees +/- 2.3 and 37.8 degrees +/- 1.5 respectively). The trunk flexed significantly further forward, confirming results from previous studies. In addition, the craniovertebral angle decreased (p < 0.001) indicating a more forward position of the head with load. It is concluded that the head functions in concert with the trunk to counterbalance load. The higher muscular tensions necessary to sustain these changes have been associated with injury, muscle strain and joint problems."

  "title": "Adaptation of postural orientation to changes in surface inclination",
  "date": "2007 Mar",
  "abstract": "We previously showed that standing on an inclined surface resulted in an after-effect of leaning in many healthy, blindfolded subjects when they returned to standing on a horizontal surface (Kluzik et al. in Exp Brain Res 162:474-489, 2005). The direction of leaning depended on the direction of prior surface inclination, always in a direction that preserved the relative alignment between the body and the support surface. For example, subjects leaned forward after they stood on a toes-up-inclined surface. In the present study, we investigated how the amplitude of surface inclination affected postural muscle activity, joint position, body segment orientation, and body center of mass (CoM) and foot center of pressure (CoP) locations before, during, and after subjects stood on an inclined surface. We asked whether the mechanism that underlies the lean after-effect involves regulation of local postural variables, such as the position of the ankle joint or the level of muscle activity, or whether instead, the mechanism involves regulation of global, whole-body postural variables that can only be determined by multisensory processing, such as orientation of the trunk or the body's CoM. In one experiment, we found that varying the amplitude of a toes-up surface inclination between 2.5 degrees and 10 degrees had a systematic, linear, effect on the post-incline orientation of the trunk and head, but did not systematically affect the post-incline orientation of the legs, position of the ankle joint, the level of EMG activity, or the location of the CoP. In a second experiment, we found that preventing the legs from leaning in the post-incline period did not abolish leaning of the upper body. These findings suggest that (1) the body-to-support-surface relationship is an important reference for the CNS internal representation of postural orientation which is subject to adaptive modification and (2) the adaptive mechanism underlying the post-incline after-effect of leaning acts at the level of global, whole-body postural variables."

  "date": "2006 Dec",
  "abstract": "Transition tasks between static and dynamic situations may challenge head stabilization and balance in older individuals. The study was designed to investigate differences between young and older women in the upper body motion during the voluntary task of gait initiation. Seven young (25+/-2.3 years) and seven older healthy women (78+/-3.4 years) were required to stand on a force platform and initiate walking at their self-selected preferred speed. Angles of head, neck and trunk were measured by motion analysis in the sagittal plane and a cross-correlation analysis was performed on segments pairs. Variability of head and neck angular displacements, as indicated by average standard deviation, was significantly greater in the older than in the young participants. The young women maintained dynamic stability of the upper body, as forward flexion of the trunk was consistently counteracted by coordinated head-neck extension. Differently, movement patterns employed by the older women also included a rigid motion of all upper body segments leaning forward as a single unit. These results demonstrated that older women perform the transition from standing to walking with greater variability in the patterns of upper body motion compared to young women."

  "date": "2007 Nov",
  "abstract": "Impairments of cervico-cephalic kinaesthesia and habitual forward head posture have been considered important in the aetiology of postural neck pain, yet these factors have not been specifically examined in a homogeneous clinical population. The objective of this study was to compare the habitual sitting posture (HSP), perception of good posture and postural repositioning error (PRE) of the cervico-thoracic (CT) spine in individuals with postural neck pain, with a matched group of asymptomatic subjects. Twenty-one subjects with postural neck pain and 22 asymptomatic control subjects were recruited into the study. An optical motion analysis system was used to measure the HSP and perceived 'good' sitting posture. PRE was measured over six trials where the subject attempted to replicate their self-selected 'good' posture. There was no difference between the groups in the HSP but significant differences were identified in the perception of 'good' posture. Posture repositioning error was higher for the head posture variables than for CT and shoulder girdle variables in both groups. However, there was no significant difference in posture repositioning error between groups for any of the posture measures. The findings suggest that individuals with postural neck pain may have a different perception of 'good' posture, but no significant difference in HSP or kinaesthetic sensibility compared with matched asymptomatic subjects."

The side of stimulation had a powerful influence on the direction but not the magnitude of sway. Individuals' mean response directions were significantly clustered between subjects, as well as within subjects for 12 of 16 subjects when tested on five occasions. Single trial analysis did not reveal any habituation of the response. To investigate whether muscle spindle activation might be responsible for the response, vibration was applied directly over posterior and anterior neck muscles and tendons. This generally produced responses that were smaller and with different direction characteristics than with mastoid vibration. In contrast, stimulation over the temporal fossa produced responses similar in magnitude and direction to mastoid stimulation. When the head was turned in yaw to face in different directions the sway response changed direction by the same amount but with no change in magnitude, suggesting response organization in a craniocentric reference frame. Whole-body sway evoked by 500 Hz vibration delivered over sites close to the ear is thus likely to represent a vestibular-evoked balance response. When compared with sway responses evoked by 500 Hz vibration of the left temporal fossa, responses to 1 mA left cathodal galvanic vestibular stimulation were of similar magnitude, yet significantly different in direction, suggesting differences in the end organ afferents activated by these two stimuli. This may enable investigation of previously inaccessible aspects of vestibular function in intact freely behaving human subjects."

  "title": "Myofascial trigger points and their relationship to headache clinical parameters in chronic tension-type headache",
  "date": "2006 Sep",
  "abstract": "Objective: To assess the presence of trigger points (TrPs) in several head and neck muscles in subjects with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) and in healthy subjects; and to evaluate the relationship of these TrPs with forward head posture (FHP), headache intensity, duration, and frequency.\nBackground: Tension-type headache (TTH) is a headache in which myofascial TrPs in head and neck muscles might play an important etiologic role.\nDesign: A blinded, controlled, pilot study.\nMethods: Twenty-five CTTH subjects and 25 matched controls without headache were studied. TrPs in bilateral upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoids, and temporalis muscles were identified according to Simons et al's diagnostic criteria: tenderness in a hyperirritable spot within a palpable taut band, local twitch response elicited by snapping palpation, and elicited referred pain with palpation. A TrP was considered active if the subject recognized the evoked referred pain as familiar headache. If the evoked referred pain was not recognized as familiar headache, the TrP was considered as latent. Side-view pictures of each subject were taken in both sitting and standing positions in order to assess FHP by measuring the cranio-vertebral angle. Both measurements were made by a blinded assessor. A headache diary was kept for 4 weeks in order to assess headache intensity, frequency, and duration.\nResults: The mean number of TrPs on each CTTH subject was 3.9 (SD: 1.2), of which 1.9 (SD: 1.2) were active TrPs and 1.9 (SD: 0.8) were latent TrPs. Control subjects only exhibited latent TrPs (mean: 1.4; SD: 0.8). There was a significant difference between the CTTH group and the controls for active TrPs (P < .001), but not for latent TrPs (P > .05). Differences in the distribution of active and latent TrPs within each muscle were also significant for all the analyzed muscles (P < .01). CTTH subjects with active TrPs in the right upper trapezius muscle or left sternocleidomastoid muscle showed a greater headache intensity and duration, but not headache frequency, compared to those with latent TrPs (P < .05). Active TrPs in the right temporalis muscle were associated with longer headache duration (P < .01), whereas active TrPs in the left temporalis muscle were associated with greater headache intensity (P < .05). CTTH subjects with active TrPs in the analyzed muscles had a greater FHP than those with latent TrPs in both sitting and standing positions. Differences were only significant for TrPs in the left sternocleidomastoid and FHP in the sitting position (P < .01).\nConclusions: Active TrPs in upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and temporalis muscles were associated with CTTH. CTTH subjects with active TrPs usually reported a greater headache intensity and longer headache duration than those with latent TrPs. CTTH subjects with active TrPs tended to have a greater FHP than CTTH subjects with latent TrPs."

  "title": "Myofascial trigger points, neck mobility and forward head posture in unilateral migraine",
  "date": "2006 Sep",
  "abstract": "This paper describes the differences in the presence of myofascial trigger points (TrPs) in the upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, temporalis and suboccipital muscles between unilateral migraine subjects and healthy controls, and the differences in the presence of TrPs between the symptomatic side and the non-symptomatic side in migraine subjects. In addition, we assess the differences in the presence of both forward head posture (FHP) and active neck mobility between migraine subjects and healthy controls and the relationship between FHP and neck mobility. Twenty subjects with unilateral migraine without side-shift and 20 matched controls participated. TrPs were identified when there was a hypersensible tender spot in a palpable taut band, local twitch response elicited by the snapping palpation of the taut band and reproduction of the referred pain typical of each TrP. Side-view pictures were taken in both sitting and standing positions to measure the cranio-vertebral angle. A cervical goniometer was employed to measure neck mobility. Migraine subjects showed a significantly greater number of active TrPs (P<0.001), but not latent TrPs, than healthy controls. Active TrPs were mostly located ipsilateral to migraine headaches (P<0.01). Migraine subjects showed a smaller cranio-vertebral angle than controls (P<0.001), thus presenting a greater FHP. Neck mobility in migraine subjects was less than in controls only for extension (P=0.02) and the total range of motion in flexion/extension (P=0.01). However, there was a positive correlation between the cranio-vertebral angle and neck mobility. Nociceptive inputs from TrPs in head and neck muscles may produce continuous afferent bombardment of the trigeminal nerve nucleus caudalis and, thence, activation of the trigeminovascular system. Active TrPs located ipsilateral to migraine headaches might be a contributing factor in the initiation or perpetuation of migraine."

  "title": "Is economy of competitive cyclists affected by the anterior-posterior foot position on the pedal?",
  "date": "2007",
  "abstract": "The primary purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that cycling economy, as measured by rate of oxygen consumption (VO(2)) in healthy, young, competitive cyclists pedaling at a constant workrate, increases (i.e. VO(2) decreases) when the attachment point of the foot to the pedal is moved posteriorly on the foot. The VO(2) of 11 competitive cyclists (age 26.8+/-8.9 years) was evaluated on three separate days with three anterior-posterior attachment points of the foot to the pedal (forward=traditional; rear=cleat halfway between the head of the first metatarsal and the posterior end of the calcaneous; and mid=halfway between the rear and forward positions) on each day. With a randomly selected foot position, VO(2) was measured as each cyclist pedaled at steady state with a cadence of 90 rpm and with a power output corresponding to approximately 90% of their ventilatory threshold (VT) (mean power output 203.3+/-20.8 W). After heart rate returned to baseline, VO(2) was measured again as the subject pedaled with a different anterior-posterior foot position, followed by another rest period and then VO(2) was measured at the final foot position. The key finding of this investigation was that VO(2) was not affected by the anterior-posterior foot position either for the group (p=0.311) or for any individual subject (p>or=0.156). The VO(2) for the group was 2705+/-324, 2696+/-337, and 2747+/-297 ml/min for the forward, mid, and rear foot positions, respectively. The practical implication of these findings is that adjusting the anterior-posterior foot position on the pedal does not affect cycling economy in competitive cyclists pedaling at a steady-state power output eliciting approximately 90% of VT."

  "date": "2006 Aug",
  "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects that an anterior cruciate ligament injury of the knee has on postural control and activity of neck, head and trunk muscles to investigate the existence of connections between the masticatory system and body posture. Surface electromyographic activity of the muscles at mandibular rest position, and during maximal voluntary clenching and posturometric and stabilometric measurements of 25 adult patients having pathology on the left knee were compared with a control non-pathological group. At rest, the patients showed a higher muscular activity of anterior temporalis, masseter, sternocleidomastoid and lower trapezius, compared with the control subjects (P < 0.05). At maximal voluntary clenching, the patients showed a lower muscular activity of the right anterior temporalis and masseter and a higher muscular activity of the lower trapezius, compared with the control subjects. For the stabilometric measurements, all the subjects showed a significant reduction in the postural centre of pressure path length during the test with eyes open and cotton rolls, compared with the test with eyes closed and mandibular rest position (P < 0.05). In addition, the patients showed a significant displacement of the postural centre of pressure in a forward direction (P < 0.05) and into the right side (P < 0.05), compared with the control subjects. Anterior cruciate ligament injury appears to be associated to a change in the activity of head, neck and trunk muscles and to a change in the position of the postural centre of pressure. Cotton rolls seem to improve the stability of the subject."

  "title": "Postural muscle tone in the body axis of healthy humans",
  "date": "2006 Nov",
  "abstract": "Across the entire human body, postural tone might play its most critical role in the body's axis because the axis joins the four limbs and head into a single functioning unit during complex motor tasks as well as in static postures. Although postural tone is commonly viewed as low-level, tonic motor activity, we hypothesized that postural tone is both tonically and dynamically regulated in the human axis even during quiet stance. Our results describe the vertical distribution of postural muscle tone in the neck, trunk, and hips of standing human adults. Each subject stood blindfolded on a platform that axially rotated the neck, trunk, or pelvis at 1 degrees /s and +/-10 degrees relative to the neutral position (i.e., facing forward). The measured resistance to axial rotation was highest in the trunk and lowest in the neck and was characterized by several nonlinear features including short-range stiffness and hysteresis. In half of the subjects, axial muscle activity was relatively constant during axial rotation, and in the other half, muscle activity was modulated by lengthening and shortening reactions, i.e., decreasing activity in lengthening muscles and increasing activity in shortening muscles, respectively. Axial resistance to rotation was reduced in subjects whose muscle activity was modulated. The results indicate that axial tone is modulated sensitively and dynamically, this control originates, at least in part, from tonic lengthening and shortening reactions, and a similar type of control appears to exist for postural tone in the proximal muscles of the arm."

  "date": "2006 Jul 15",
  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine if posture during gait can be affected by position of the load. It was hypothesized that the front pack would result in postural changes in the gait cycle, compared to a similarly loaded backpack. Thirteen healthy adults, free of any injury, volunteered to participate in this study. Two dimensional video data were collected at 50 Hz using a MacReflex video system. A backpack and a front pack were compared using loads of 10 and 15% of body weight. Markers were placed on the ear, acromion, greater trochanter and lateral joint line of the knee, lateral malleolus and fifth metatarsophalangeal joint. Data were collected while the participants walked at 0.75 stride/s. The data were used to calculate joint angles and displacements during each gait cycle. There was a significant difference noted in angles of the hip flexion, with the backpack condition demonstrating a greater flexion in each stride than either the control or front pack. Both backpack and front pack conditions demonstrated a significant change in neck motion compared to the control condition. The results of the position analysis over time also revealed an increase in the forward head position when participants were wearing the backpack compared to either the control or the front pack condition. It was concluded that the use of a front pack results in a more upright posture in gait, when compared to a backpack carrying the same load."

  "date": "2006 Jul 15",
  "abstract": "Poor posture has been suggested as one of the main factors contributing to the high prevalence of neck pain in video display unit (VDU) users, but no clear association between pain and any particular resting neck posture has been found. Postural awareness of the neck, as indicated by the repositioning accuracy, may therefore be an appropriate measure and potentially useful assessment tool. The objective of this study is to examine whether posture and fatigue affect the head repositioning ability in typical VDU usage. A group of 20 healthy participants reproduced a normal comfortable posture for forward, upright and backward chair back inclinations in random order both before and after fatigue of the upper trapezius muscles. Ten repetitions of the posture were recorded for 2 s each, and the angular and translational deviations from the original head position were measured with regard to the external environment (head in space repositioning) and with regard to the trunk (head on trunk repositioning). Analysis by repeated measures ANOVA showed significant effects and interactions of fatigue and chair back inclination on the repositioning errors in the sagittal plane, which typically showed systematic trends towards certain postures rather than random errors around a mean position. While further work is required to examine the ergonomic impact of impaired repositioning ability, head repositioning is sensitive to ergonomic factors such as seating configuration and fatigue, and may therefore be a useful tool for evaluation of static working postures."

  "title": "Pattern of motor coordination underlying backward swimming in the lamprey",
  "date": "2006 Jul",
  "abstract": "The main form of locomotion in the lamprey (a lower vertebrate, cyclostome) is forward swimming (FS) based on periodical waves of lateral body flexion propagating from head to tail. The lamprey is also capable of backward swimming (BS). Here we describe the kinematical and electromyographic (EMG) pattern of BS, as well as the effects on this pattern exerted by different lesions of the spinal cord. The BS was evoked by tactile stimulation of a large area in the anterior part of the body. Swimming was attributed to the waves of lateral body undulations propagating from tail to head. The EMG bursts on the two sides alternated, and the EMG in more caudal segments led in phase the EMG in more rostral segments. Main kinematical characteristics of BS strongly differed from those of FS: the amplitude of undulations was much larger and their frequency lower. Also, the maintenance of the dorsal-side-up body orientation ascribed to vestibular postural reflexes (typical for FS) was not observed during BS. A complete transection of the spinal cord did not abolish the generation of forward-propagating waves rostral to the lesion. After a lateral hemisection of the spinal cord, the BS pattern persisted on both sides rostral to the lesion; caudal to the lesion, it was present on the intact side and reduced or abolished on the lesioned side. The role of the spinal cord in generation of different forms of undulatory locomotion (FS and BS) is discussed."

  "title": "A retrospective and prospective view of orofacial myology",
  "date": "2005 Nov",
  "abstract": "Orofacial myofunctional disorders include specific conditions or behaviors that can have a negative impact on oral postures and functions. Historically, interest has focused on behaviors in the horizontal plane, highlighted by tongue thrusting. Currently, the scope of practice also includes tongue forward posturing, lip incompetence, open mouth rest posture, thumb and finger sucking, bruxism, and biting habits involving lips, fingers, tongue and cheeks. The common denominator for myofunctional conditions is a change in the inter-dental arch vertical rest posture dimension, the dental freeway space. The purposes of myofunctional therapy include normalizing the freeway space dimension by eliminating noxious habits or postures related to freeway space change. Improving cosmesis with a lips-together rest posture is also an important treatment goal. The clinical significance of the freeway space is explained in terms of the dental consequences of differential eruption patterns that can develop from postural modification of the freeway space. When the freeway space is opened for extended periods beyond the normal range, the tongue can act as a functional appliance and contribute to the development of anterior open bite or a Class II malocclusion. A clinical procedure is proposed for evaluating the freeway space dimension and incorporating the information into treatment planning and evaluation of treatment success. While dentistry/orthodontics has a primary focus on dental occlusion, or teeth-together relationships, orofacial myologists focus on teeth-apart behaviors and postures that can lead to, or have already resulted in malocclusion."

The ground reaction forces varied between the Tai Chi movements and normal walking. Compared with normal walking, the locations of the COP in the Tai Chi movements were significantly more medial and posterior at initial contact (P<.05), and were significantly more medial and anterior at the end of contact with the ground (P<.05). The displacements of the COP were significantly wider (P<.05) in the mediolateral direction in the forward, backward, and sideways Tai Chi movements. The displacement was significantly larger (P<.05) in the anteroposterior direction in the forward movement.\nConclusions: The plantar pressure characteristics of Tai Chi movements found in this study may be one of the important factors that Tai Chi exercise improves balance control and muscle strength."

  "title": "Analysis of right anterolateral impacts: the effect of trunk flexion on the cervical muscle whiplash response",
  "date": "2006 May 16",
  "abstract": "Background: The cervical muscles are considered a potential site of whiplash injury, and there is a need to understand the cervical muscle response under non-conventional whiplash impact scenarios, including variable body position and impact direction. There is no data, however, on the effect of occupant position on the muscle response to frontal impacts. Therefore, the objective of the study was to measure cervical muscle response to graded right anterolateral impacts.\nMethods: Twenty volunteers were subjected to right anterolateral impacts of 4.3, 7.8, 10.6, and 12.8 m/s(2) acceleration with their trunk flexed forward 45 degrees and laterally flexed right or left by 45 degrees. Bilateral EMG of the sternocleidomastoids, trapezii, and splenii capitis and acceleration of the sled, torso, and head were measured.\nResults and discussion: With either direction of trunk flexion at impact, the trapezius EMGs increased with increasing acceleration (p < 0.05). Time to onset of the electromyogram and time to peak electromyogram for most muscles showed a trend towards decreasing with increasing acceleration. With trunk flexion to the left, the left trapezius generated 38% of its maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) EMG, while the right trapezius generated 28% of its MVC EMG. All other muscles generated 25% or less of this measure (25% for the left splenius capitis, 8% for the right splenius capitis, 6% for the left sternocleidomastoid, and 2% for the left sterncleidomastoid). Conversely, with the trunk flexed to the right, the right trapezius generated 44% of its MVC EMG, while the left trapezius generated 31% of this value, and all other muscles generated 20% or less of their MVC EMG (20% for the left splenius capitis, 14% for the right splenius capitis, 4% for both the left and right sternocleidomastoids).\nConclusion: When the subject sits with trunk flexed out of neutral posture at the time of anterolateral impact, the cervical muscle response is dramatically reduced compared to frontal impacts with the trunk in neutral posture. In the absence of bodily impact, the flexed trunk posture appears to produce a biomechanical response that would decrease the likelihood of cervical muscle injury in low velocity impacts."

  "date": "2006 May",
  "abstract": "Object: A rotated head posture at the time of vehicular rear impact has been correlated with a higher incidence and greater severity of chronic radicular symptoms than accidents occurring with the occupant facing forward. No studies have been conducted to quantify the dynamic changes in foramen dimensions during head-turned rear-impact collisions. The objectives of this study were to quantify the changes in foraminal width, height, and area during head-turned rear-impact collisions and to determine if dynamic narrowing causes potential cervical nerve root or ganglion impingement.\nMethods: The authors subjected a whole cervical spine model with muscle force replication and a surrogate head to simulated head-turned rear impacts of 3.5, 5, 6.5, and 8 G following a noninjurious 2-G baseline acceleration. Continuous dynamic foraminal width, height, and area narrowing were recorded, and peaks were determined during each impact; these data were then statistically compared with those obtained at baseline. The authors observed significant increases (p < 0.05) in mean peak foraminal width narrowing values greater than baseline values, of up to 1.8 mm in the left C5-6 foramen at 8 G. At the right C2-3 foramen, the mean peak dynamic foraminal height was significantly narrower than baseline when subjected to rear-impacts of 5 and 6.5 G, but no significant increases in foraminal area were observed. Analysis of the results indicated that the greatest potential for cervical ganglion compression injury existed at C5-6 and C6-7. Greater potential for ganglion compression injury existed at C3-4 and C4-5 during head-turned rear impact than during head-forward rear impact.\nConclusions: Extrapolation of present results indicated potential ganglion compression in patients with a non-stenotic foramen at C5-6 and C6-7; in patients with a stenotic foramen the injury risk greatly increases and spreads to include the C3-4 through C6-7 as well as C4-5 through C6-7 nerve roots."

Kinematics of body movement were recorded (Elite 2000 system) simultaneously with the signals from three force plates (AMTI) placed beneath the buttocks and hands. Temporal and spatial parameters regarding head, trunk and trailing arm displacement, loading amplitudes and loading torque directions of both hands were analyzed for each trial and subject and compared between genders.\nResults: Men and women used similar amplitudes of head bending and forward displacement of the trailing shoulder, while female subjects had significantly larger trunk rotation. Both genders applied significantly more weight on the trailing hand. Differences between genders were seen in direction and timing of peak torque beneath the hands.\nConclusions: The forces beneath the trailing hand were larger than those in the leading, if there is weakness or pain in one arm, this arm should be selected as the leading. To avoid excessive load on the arms, technical aids and environmental factors should be very well adapted.\nSponsorship: This project was funded by the Swedish Research Council and the Health Care Science Committee of Karolinska Institutet."

  "date": "2006 Apr 29",
  "abstract": "The clinical findings and treatment of 94 cattle with listeriosis are described. The general behaviour and condition of the animals were mostly moderately to severely disturbed. A common abnormality in posture was an exaggerated forward or sideward stance, and 11 of the animals were recumbent. More than half of the animals were ataxic and 22 circled. The most frequent cranial neurological signs observed were facial nerve paralysis, salivation, strabismus, reduced or absent pupillary light reflex, reduced or absent tongue movement and head tilt. The haematological and biochemical findings did not contribute to the diagnosis of listeriosis, but they were useful indicators of dehydration and the acid-base status of the animal. Forty-four of 57 of the animals had high leucocyte counts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), mostly mononuclear cells. Eighty-seven of the animals were treated with various antibiotics (penicillin G, oxytetracycline, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin and gentamicin combined), but there was no significant difference in the success rate of the different treatments. Only two of the nine recumbent animals that were treated survived. Univariable analysis suggested that animals that were recumbent, excited, with an absent or weak menace reflex, nystagmus, high numbers of leucocytes in the CSF, high serum concentrations of urea and calcium and high serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase, and an acid-base deficit, had a smaller chance of surviving. When a logistic regression model was constructed, only recumbency, excitement and a weak or absent menace reflex remained significant factors affecting the likelihood of survival."

  "abstract": "Purpose: This study evaluated oropharyngeal airway changes and stability following surgical counter-clockwise rotation and advancement of the maxillo-mandibular complex.\nMethods and patients: Fifty-six adults (48 females, 8 males), between 15 and 51 years of age, were treated with Le Fort I osteotomies and bilateral mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomies to advance the maxillo-mandibular complex with a counter-clockwise rotation. The average postsurgical follow-up was 34 months. Each patient's lateral cephalograms were traced, digitized twice, and averaged to estimate surgical changes (T2-T1) and postsurgical changes (T3-T2).\nResults: During surgery, the occlusal plane angle decreased significantly (8.6 +/- 5.8 degrees ) and the maxillo-mandibular complex advanced and rotated counter-clockwise. The maxilla moved forward (2.4 +/- 2.7 mm) at ANS and the mandible was advanced 13.1 +/- 5.1 mm at menton, 10 +/- 4.4 mm at point B, and 6.9 +/- 3.7 mm at lower incisor edge. Postsurgical hard tissue changes were not statistically significant. While the upper oropharyngeal airway decreased significantly (4.2 +/- 3.4 mm) immediately after surgery, the narrowest retropalatal, lowest retropalatal airway, and the narrowest retroglossal airway measurements increased 2.9 +/- 2.7, 3.7 +/- 3.2, and 4.4 +/- 4.4 mm, respectively. Over the average 34 months postsurgical period, upper retropalatal airway increased 3.9 +/- 3.7 mm, while narrowest retropalatal, lowest retropalatal airway, and narrowest retroglossal airway remained stable. Head posture showed flexure immediately after surgery (4.8 +/- 5.9 degrees ) and extension postsurgically (1.6 +/- 5.6 degrees ).\nConclusion: Maxillo-mandibular advancement with counter-clockwise rotation produces immediate increases in middle and lower oropharyngeal airway dimensions, which were constrained by changes in head posture but remain stable over the postsurgical period. The upper oropharyngeal airway space increased only on the longest follow-up."

  "abstract": "Objective: To assess the presence of trigger points (TrPs) in the suboccipital muscles and forward head posture (FHP) in subjects with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) and in healthy subjects, and to evaluate the relationship of TrPs and FHP with headache intensity, duration, and frequency.\nBackground: Tension-type headache (TTH) is a prototypical headache in which myofascial TrPs in the cervical and pericranial musculature can play an important role.\nDesign: A blinded, controlled pilot study.\nMethods: Twenty CTTH subjects and 20 matched controls without headache participated. TrPs were identified by eliciting referred pain with palpation, and increased referred pain with muscle contraction. Side-view pictures of each subject were taken in sitting and standing positions, in order to assess FHP by measuring the craniovertebral angle. Both measures were taken by a blinded assessor. A headache diary was kept for 4 weeks in order to assess headache intensity, frequency, and duration.\nResults: Sixty-five percent (13/20) CTTH subjects showed active TrPs and 35% (7/20) had latent TrPs in the suboccipital muscles. Six (30%) controls also had latent TrPs. Differences in the presence of suboccipital muscle TrPs between both the groups were significant for active TrPs (P < .001) but not for latent TrPs (P > .5). CTTH subjects with active TrPs reported a greater headache intensity and frequency than those with latent TrPs (P < .05). The degree of FHP was greater in CTTH subjects than in controls in both sitting and standing positions (P < .01). Within the CTTH group, there was a negative correlation between the craniovertebral angle and the frequency of headache (r(s) = -0.6, P < .01, in sitting position; r(s) = -0.5, P < .05, in standing position). CTTH subjects with active TrPs had a greater FHP than those with latent TrPs, though this difference was not significant.\nConclusions: Suboccipital active TrPs and FHP were associated with CTTH. CCTH subjects with active TrPs reported a greater headache intensity and frequency than those with latent TrPs. The degree of FHP correlated positively with headache duration, headache frequency, and the presence of suboccipital active TrPs."

  "date": "2006 Apr",
  "abstract": "Objective: To examine the effect of forward and lateral trunk flexion on the cervical electromyogram and head kinematic response to whiplash-type frontal impacts.\nDesign: Observational study of sled impacts.\nSetting: Laboratory.\nParticipants: Twenty healthy volunteers.\nIntervention: Twenty volunteers were subjected to increasing low-velocity (<8km/h) frontal impacts of 4.4, 7.6, 10.3, and 13.3m/s(2) acceleration with trunk forward flexed by 45 degrees and laterally flexed to the right and left by 45 degrees .\nMain outcome measures: Bilateral electromyography of the sternocleidomastoids, trapezii, and splenii capitis and acceleration of the sled, torso, and head were recorded.\nResults: With either direction of lateral trunk flexion at impact, the trapezii electromyographic activity increased with increasing acceleration (P<.05). With the trunk flexed to the left, the left trapezius generated 39% of its maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) electromyographic activity, while the right trapezius generated 31% of its MVC electromyographic activity. The left splenius (ipsilateral to leftward trunk flexion) generated 24% of its MVC electromyographic activity, with all other muscles generating 15% or less of this measure. With the trunk flexed to the right, the right trapezius generated 38% of its MVC electromyographic activity, while the left trapezius generated 32% of this value. Again, the ipsilateral (to trunk flexion) splenius capitis generated 27% of its MVC electromyographic activity, and all other muscles 11% or less of this measure.\nConclusions: When subjects sit with trunk flexed out of neutral posture at the time of frontal impact, the cervical muscle response is low and unlikely to be injurious."

  "title": "Bilateral vestibular loss leads to active destabilization of balance during voluntary head turns in the standing cat",
  "date": "2006 Jun",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the source of postural instability in labyrinthectomized cats during lateral head turns. Cats were trained to maintain the head in a forward orientation and then perform a rapid, large-amplitude head turn to left or right in yaw, while standing freely on a force platform. Head turns were biomechanically complex with the primary movement in the yaw plane accompanied by an ipsilateral ear-down roll and nose-down pitch. Cats used a strategy of pushing off by activating extensors of the contralateral forelimb while using all four limbs to produce a rotational moment of force about the vertical axis. After bilateral labyrinthectomy, the initial components of the head turn and accompanying postural responses were hypermetric, but otherwise similar to those produced before the lesion. However, near the time of peak yaw velocity, the lesioned cats produced an unexpected burst in extensors of the contralateral limbs that thrust the body to the ipsilateral side, leading to falls. This postural error was in the frontal (roll) plane, even though the primary movement was a rotation in the horizontal (yaw) plane. The response error decreased in amplitude with compensation but did not disappear. We conclude that lack of vestibular input results in active destabilization of balance during voluntary head movement. We postulate that the postural imbalance arises from the misperception that the trunk was rolling contralaterally, based on signals from neck proprioceptors in the absence of vestibular inputs."

  "abstract": "Previous investigations analyzed the effect of semicircular canal stimulation on the localization of a remembered target and found additional indications that different head positions affect the test results. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of different head and body positions on the localization performance towards a remembered target. The pointing error (PE) towards a remembered target was investigated in 24 right-handed volunteers (12 females, 12 males; mean age 23 years) under six different head and body positions (sitting upright with the head tilted forward/backward by 45 degrees ; sitting upright with a head displacement of 90 degrees to the right/left relative to the body; lying on the right/left side of the body). Evaluation parameters were the horizontal and vertical PE (in degrees). Head displacement to the left relative to the body led to a PE to the right side and head displacement to the right led to a PE to the left (ANOVA P<0.001; df=5; F=16.92). An upward PE occurred when the head was tilted forward by 45 degrees and a downward PE could be proved when the head was tilted backward by 45 degrees (ANOVA P<0.001; df=5; F=35.78). In summary, any change in the relation between head and body position led to a systematic PE towards the frontal plane of the body (i.e. the plane located in the axis between both shoulders). Taken together, the systematic PE in direction to the frontal body plane suggests that the location of the remembered target is coded and remembered in a frame linked to the body and not transformed into a head-centered frame of reference."

  "title": "Otolith function assessed with the subjective postural horizontal and standardised stance and gait tasks",
  "date": "2006",
  "abstract": "If otolith function is essential to maintain upright standing while moving along slanted or uneven surfaces, subjects with an otolith deficit should have difficulty judging whether the inclination of the surface on which they are standing is tilted or not. We tested this judgement and compared it with the ability to control trunk sway during standardised stance and gait tests. Thirteen patients with unilateral vestibular nerve neurectomy at least 6 months prior to testing and 39 age-matched controls were asked to move a dynamic posturography platform on which they were standing back to their subjective 'horizontal' position after the platform had been slowly tilted at 0.4 degrees/s to 5 degrees in 8 different directions. Normal subjects left the platform deviated in pitch (forwards-backwards) at about 0.7 degrees on describing the platform as levelled off for all directions of tilt. Patients showed larger deviations of about 1.3 degrees in pitch with significant differences for forward right tilt (1.58+/-0.73 degrees compared to 0.73+/-0.11 degrees for normals; mean and SEM) and for forward left. Roll (lateral) deviations were about 0.4 degrees for normals and 0.5 degrees larger for the patients (for example, for backward left, 1.13+/-0.24 degrees compared to 0.4+/-0.07 degrees in normals). Except for a tendency towards greater deviations to the lesion side of patients with eyes closed, no differences were noted between tests under eyes open and closed conditions. However, for backward and roll tilts patients needed to steady themselves first by grasping a handrail when tested with eyes closed. Stance tests on foam showed increases in roll and pitch trunk sway with respect to controls. Patients had significantly larger trunk roll sway deviations during 1-legged stance tests and during gait trials. For stance trials, the patients lost their balance control prior to the end of the standard 20-second recording time. We conclude that a unilateral loss of otolith inputs due to nerve resection permanently impairs the ability to judge whether the support surface is horizontal, and leads to excessive trunk sway when standing on a compliant surface as well as excessive trunk roll sway during gait."

  "abstract": "Forward head posture (FHP) and neck mobility were objectively assessed in 25 patients with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) and 25 healthy controls. Side-view pictures were taken in a sitting position to measure the cranio-vertebral angle. A cervical goniometer was employed to measure the range of all cervical motions. Patients with CTTH showed a smaller cranio-vertebral angle (45.3 degrees +/- 7.6 degrees) than controls (54.1 degrees +/- 6.3 degrees), thus presenting a greater FHP (P < 0.001). Patients also had lesser neck mobility for all cervical movements, except for right lateral flexion (P < 0.01). There was a positive correlation between the cranio-vertebral angle and neck mobility. Within the CTTH group, a negative correlation was found between the cranio-vertebral angle and headache frequency, but neck mobility did not correlate with headache parameters. Further research is needed to define a potential role of FHP and restricted neck mobility in the origin or maintenance of TTH."

  "abstract": "Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects that an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury of the knee has on postural control and activity of neck, head and trunk muscles in order to investigate the existence of connections between the masticatory system and body posture.\nMethods: Surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity of the muscles and their asymmetry index, at mandibular rest position, and during maximal voluntary clenching (MVC), and posturometric and stabilometric measurements of 25 patients (mean age 28+/-9 years) having undergone ACL injury of the left knee were compared with a control non-pathologic group.\nResults: At rest, the patients showed a higher sEMG activity of the anterior temporalis, masseter, sternocleidomastoid and lower trapezius, compared with the control subjects (P<0.05). At MVC, the patients showed a lower sEMG activity of the right anterior temporalis and masseter and a higher sEMG activity of the lower trapezius, compared with the control subjects. For the stabilometric measurements, all the subjects showed a significant reduction in the Center of Pressure (CoP) path length during the test with eyes open and cotton rolls, compared with the test with eyes closed and mandibular rest position (P<0.05). In addition, the patients showed a significant displacement of the CoP in a forward direction (P<0.05) and to the righ side (P<0.05), compared with the control-subjects during each test.\nConclusions: ACL injury appears to be associated to a change in the sEMG activity of head, neck and trunk muscles and to a change in the position of the CoP of the body. Cotton rolls seem to improve the stability of the subject."

  "abstract": "Introduction: The aim of this project was to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of static and dynamic (measured during walking) measurements of head posture.\nMethods: The sample consisted of 50 subjects, 25 women and 25 men, 20 to 25 years of age. None had a history of orthodontic treatment, head or neck injury, or nasal breathing problems, and none wore eyeglasses to correct vision. Static measurement of head position was recorded by using the self-balance position. Dynamic measurements of head position were made with an inclinometer device with the subject walking in a relaxed manner for 5 minutes. The data, measured in degrees, were stored in a pocket data logger. Recorded static and dynamic head posture data were transferred to a computer for analysis. The means of the measurements were statistically compared with the t test (alpha = .05). The mean walking head position was tipped forward relative to the mean static head position.\nResults: The mean value of static position minus walking head position measurements was +4.60 degrees . The differences between the 2 recordings were statistically significant (P < .001).\nConclusions: Static and walking head position measurements are not interchangeable. Therefore, it might be advisable to use the mean dynamic measurement of head position to represent natural head position for positioning when taking case records such as lateral and posteroanterior cephalograms, clinical extraoral photography, or 3-dimensional imaging."

  "date": "2006 Mar",
  "abstract": "Background: Elongation-induced vertebral artery injury has been hypothesized to occur during non-physiological coupled axial rotation and extension of head. No studies have quantified dynamic vertebral artery elongation during head-turned rear impacts. Therefore, we evaluated effect of rotated head posture vs. forward head posture at the time of impact on dynamic vertebral artery elongation during simulated rear impacts.\nMethods: A whole cervical spine model with surrogate head and muscle force replication underwent either simulated head-turned (n = 6) or head-forward (n = 6) rear impacts of 3.5, 5, 6.5 and 8 g. Continuous dynamic vertebral artery elongation was recorded using custom transducer and compared to physiological values obtained during intact flexibility testing.\nFindings: Average (SD) peak dynamic vertebral artery elongation of up to 30.5 (2.6) mm during head-turned rear-impact significantly exceeded (P < 0.05) the physiological beginning at 5 g. Highest peak elongation of 5.8 (2.1) mm during head-forward rear impact did not exceed physiological limit. Head-turned rear impact caused earlier occurrence of average peak vertebral artery elongation, 84.5 (4.2) ms vs. 161.0 (43.8) ms, and higher average peak vertebral artery elongation rate, 1336.7 (74.5) mm/s vs. 211.5 (97.4) mm/s, as compared to head-forward rear impact.\nInterpretation: Elongation-induced vertebral artery injury is more likely to occur in those with rotated head posture at the time of rear impact, as compared to head-forward."

  "abstract": "Background: Spatial disorientation is an important problem in aviation. The mechanisms behind the sensation of roll tilt during coordinated turns are not well known. The present study aimed at elucidating what kind of semicircular canal information might cause tilts of the subjective horizontal during gondola centrifugation.\nMethods: The subjective visual horizontal (SVH) was measured by means of an adjustable visual line in darkness. Subjects (n = 8) underwent four centrifuge runs (2 G, 5 min), sitting in different positions, i.e., heading forwards, backwards, centripetally, and centrifugally. The roll position of the gondola (60 degrees at 2 G) was controlled so that the subject was always upright with respect to the resultant gravitoinertial force vector. Thus, the semicircular-canal stimulus components in yaw, pitch, and roll were varied to some extent independently of each other.\nResults: For the forward position the SVH was substantially tilted in a direction compensatory with respect to the inclination of the gondola. For the backward position there was also a tendency to a compensatory SVH tilt. In all subjects the magnitude of tilt was larger for the forward position than for the backward. The group means were +20.9 +/- 8.4 degrees and -6.9 +/- 10.5 degrees (positive sign designates a clockwise deviation of the SVH), p < 0.001, n = 8. There were no significant SVH tilts for the centripetal (+6.4 +/- 10.7 degrees) and centrifugal (+2.1 +/- 4.8 degrees) positions. The effects of deceleration of the centrifuge were very small for all positions.\nConclusion: These findings suggest that the substantial SVH tilt after acceleration heading forwards is not directly related to any single component of semicircular canal stimulation but depends on the ability of the brain to expediently process complex stimulus patterns."

CC was progressive and the major handicap for both patients after 1 and 1.5 years of follow-up, respectively. The therapeutic response was poor.

  "abstract": "Forward head posture may cause alterations in the stomatognathic system, including changes in the muscle activity of the masticatory muscles and dental occlusion alterations. Considering the need for further understanding of the relationship between the stomatognathic system and the cervical region, the purpose of this study was to analyse the head posture and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the anterior portion of temporal and masseter muscles bilaterally among bruxist's subjects with different dental occlusion classifications using the Angle method. The study consisted of 20 female volunteers, between the ages of 17 and 27 years. They were separated into two groups (class I and class II occlusions) according to a dentist-performed evaluation. An assessment of forward head posture was conducted using a photographic technique (angular calculus) combined with a clinical analysis. In the EMG analyses, active differential surface electrodes (Ag) were utilized and were placed bilaterally on the belly of masseter and temporal muscles, perpendicular to the muscles fibres. The EMG signal recorded during bilateral isotonic mastication, was presented using the Root Mean Square and was processed by Matlab software. The results indicated that the EMG responses of temporal and masseter muscles tend to be modified by occlusion alteration class II. Subjects with class II occlusion tended to present more occurrence of forward head posture with alterations in the muscle activity pattern between masseter and temporal muscles."

  "abstract": "In an earlier questionnaire study, dentists reported high experienced physical work load in their profession, but low to moderate complaints from their musculoskeletal system. The correlation between reported physical work load and pain from the musculoskeletal system was weak. This discrepancy could not be satisfactorily explained. Therefore, a second study was undertaken, in which the same 27 dentists who reported musculoskeletal problems were video recorded during one hour of clinical work, and the records were later analyzed using PEO (Portable Ergonomic Observation). PEO is a frequency analysis method which allows observation of work in real time using a portable computer or video recordings. PEO can be adjusted for registration of single or multiple work operations. Output data are presented as frequency, duration, and sequence of the various work operations. The aim of the present study was to investigate if there was a relation between observed work load recorded with PEO, and subjectively estimated work load and musculoskeletal complaints recorded with a questionnaire based on Visual Analogue Scales. Sitting and standing postures, and head, trunk and arm movements were analyzed. The PEO observations showed that dentists generally perform their clinical work in a sitting position, with the head bent forward almost half of the time. Only weak to moderate correlations (r =0.0-0.6) were found between observed physical work load and subjective estimations of experienced physical work load and musculoskeletal complaints. These findings support the results in our previous study, but they do not explain the large difference between the observed low work load and the subjectively experienced high work load. The study will be followed up by EMG measurements and free interviews, where both muscular load and psychosocial factors will be evaluated."

  "abstract": "Postural responses were utilized as measures of the effectiveness of a wide-angle visual flow display in determining perceived spatial orientation (SO). The general experimental setup included a 150 degrees x 34 degrees wide-field display showing flight over computer-generated ground with horizon. Simulated roll maneuvers on this display induced postural sway in the observer that was registered by a head-tracker system. Two experiments with 16 participants in each investigated the effects of visual flow, display exclusions in the central visual field, and display extensions into the visual periphery. Clear vestibular and proprioceptive suppression effects were demonstrated on postural sway with the inclusion of visual flow of forward ego motion in roll maneuvers. Compared with the full view, up to 20 degrees x 20 degrees central field omission either did not reduce the effect or reduced the effect but, frequently, only moderately. Limiting the display area to 45 degrees in the horizontal dimension reduced display effectiveness significantly, whereas a 105 degrees area did not, compared with the full view. Utilizing postural responses as indications of visual display resonance with our SO mechanism, actual or potential applications of this research include the design of an interface integrating flight-adapted visual flow to counteract or reduce pilot spatial disorientation."

  "abstract": "Conclusions: Postural responses differed according to the stimulus direction, i.e. vertical visual stimulation induced head rather than trunk displacements. Accordingly, it could be that center of foot pressure (COP) responses tended to underestimate the postural sway during visual stimulation.\nObjectives: To investigate head and body sway in response to vertical visual surround motion, and to examine the correlation between the displacements of head and body segments derived from video-motion analysis and COP measurements.\nMaterial and methods: Postural sway was assessed in 10 young female subjects by video-motion analysis of four different head and body segments, and by use of force-plate posturography. Head and body sway in the pitch plane was induced by rotating a random pattern of dots about the subject's inter-aural axis at a constant acceleration of 1 degree/s(2) or a constant velocity of 60 degrees/s in darkness.\nResults: Generally, head displacement was greater than that of other body parts during vertical optokinetic stimulation (OKS). In most subjects, maximum head displacements were induced in the same direction as the visual motion. Downward OKS induced a forward head and body sway. The COP trajectory correlated well with the displacements of each head and body segment during downward OKS. In contrast, postural responses to upward OKS were complicated in terms of their time course. The correlation coefficient between each head and body segment and the COP varied among individuals for upward OKS."

  "date": "2005 Dec",
  "abstract": "In clinical practice, postural correction is a common treatment approach for individuals with neck and shoulder pain. As chronic static muscle use is thought to be associated with the onset of some neck and shoulder pain syndromes, it is important to understand the impact a postural correction program might have on muscle activation amplitudes in the neck and shoulder regions. Normalized surface electromyographic data were recorded from the levator scapulae, upper trapezius, supraspinatus, posterior deltoid, masseter, rhomboid major, cervical erector spinae, and sternocleidomastoid muscles of the dominant side of each of eighteen healthy subjects. Subjects performed five repetitions of each of four seated typing postures (habitual, corrected, head-forward and slouched) and four standing postures (habitual, corrected, and head-forward and slouched). Repeated-measures analysis of variance models (alpha=0.05) revealed that in sitting postural correction tended to decreased the level of muscle activation required in all muscles studied during seated computer work, however this finding was not statistically significant. Corrected posture in sitting did, however produce a statistically significant reduction in muscle activity compared to forward head posture. Corrected posture in standing required more muscle activity than habitual or forward head posture in the majority of cervicobrachial and jaw muscles, suggesting that a graduated approach to postural correction exercises might be required in order to train the muscles to appropriately withstand the requirements of the task. A surprising finding was that muscle activity levels and postural changes had the largest impact on the masseter muscle, which demonstrated activation levels in the order of 20% maximum voluntary electrical activation."

  "date": "2005 Dec",
  "abstract": "Although the supplementary eye field (SEF) has been implicated in the control of head movements associated with gaze shifts, there is no direct evidence that SEF plays a role in the generation of head movements independent of gaze. If the SEF does, varying the duration of stimulation should selectively alter the head-movement kinematics during the postgaze-shift period. The duration of the stimulation was manipulated while head-unrestrained monkeys maintained stable head forward postures. The initial positions of the eyes in the orbits were systematically varied. Although combined movements of the eyes and head were produced in the majority of the trials, head movements were sometimes evoked in the absence of gaze shifts. These head-alone movements were most frequent when the initial eye position was contralateral to the stimulated side. When the stimulation produced eye and head movements, gaze onset was sometimes preceded by a relatively low-velocity phase of the head movement. Evoked head movements were primarily horizontal, unlike the gaze shifts, which typically had vertical components that varied according to the initial positions of the eyes in the orbits. The postgaze-shift head movements tended to be of low velocity and in many cases persisted until stimulation offset. In general, prolonging the stimulation resulted in improved centering of the eyes in the orbits. These findings suggest that, in addition to its previously described role in the generation of coordinated eye-head gaze shifts, the SEF is also involved in the control of head movements in the absence of a change of gaze."

  "title": "Heading in football. Part 1: development of biomechanical methods to investigate head response",
  "date": "2005 Aug",
  "abstract": "Objectives: There has been growing controversy regarding long term effects of repeated low severity head impacts such as when heading a football. However, there are few scientific data substantiating these concerns in terms of the biomechanical head response to impact. The present study aimed to develop a research methodology to investigate the biomechanical response of human subjects during intentional heading and identify strategies for reducing head impact severity.\nMethods: A controlled laboratory study was carried out with seven active football players, aged 20-23 and of average stature and weight. The subjects were fitted with photographic targets for kinematic analysis and instrumented to measure head linear/angular accelerations and neck muscle activity. Balls were delivered at two speeds (6 m/s and 8 m/s) as the subjects executed several specific forward heading manoeuvres in the standing position. Heading speeds up to 11 m/s were seen when the head closing speed was considered. One subject demonstrating averaged flexion-extension muscle activity phased with head acceleration data and upper torso kinematics was used to validate a biofidelic 50th percentile human model with a detailed head and neck. The model was exercised under ball incoming speeds of 6-7 m/s with parameter variations including torso/head alignment, neck muscle tensing, and follow through. The model output was subsequently compared with additional laboratory tests with football players (n = 3). Additional heading scenarios were investigated including follow through, non-active ball impact, and non-contact events. Subject and model head responses were evaluated with peak linear and rotational accelerations and maximum incremental head impact power.\nResults: Modelling of neck muscle tensing predicted lower head accelerations and higher neck loads whereas volunteer head acceleration reductions were not consistent. Modelling of head-torso alignment predicted a modest reduction in volunteer head accelerations. Exaggerated follow through while heading reduced volunteer head accelerations modestly.\nConclusion: Biomechanical methods were developed to measure head impact response. Changing the biomechanics of currently accepted heading techniques will have inconsistent benefits towards the reduction of head loading. Furthermore, mathematical modelling suggested an increased risk of neck loads with one alternative technique. No consistent recommendations can be made on the basis of the current study for altering heading techniques to reduce impact severity."

  "date": "2005 Jul-Aug",
  "abstract": "Changes in upper body posture, colloquially termed forward head posture (FHP), are considered to be an etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). The literature suggests that postural deviations associated with FHP follow distinct patterns involving an increase in the thoracic kyphosis angle and a downwardly rotated, anteriorly tilted, and protracted scapula, which in turn leads to increased compression in the subacromial space. These postural changes are thought to occur concurrently with an imbalance of the musculature, and conservative rehabilitation commonly involves addressing both posture and muscle imbalance. There is a paucity of evidence supporting the hypothesis that posture and muscle imbalance are involved in the etiology of SIS. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether FHP was associated with an increased thoracic kyphosis, an altered position of the scapula; and a reduction in glenohumeral elevation range. Selected sagittal and frontal plane postural measurements were made in 60 asymptomatic subjects and 60 subjects with SIS. The findings suggested that upper body posture does not follow the set patterns described in the literature, and further research is required to determine whether upper body and scapular posture and muscle imbalance are involved in the pathogenesis of SIS."

  "title": "Anticipatory locomotor adjustments of the trail limb during surface accommodation",
  "date": "2006 Apr",
  "abstract": "This paper explores anticipatory locomotor adjustments of the trail limb when stepping up to a new level. The kinematics and kinetics of the trail limb for nine subjects were compared across level gait and surface accommodation. The largest generation of new rotational energy was found at the trail ankle, during the latter part of stance (i.e. ankle 'push-off'). Accelerations of the head, arms and trunk (HAT) and foot segments during the same phase indicate that the ankle power acted to push the body and lead limb up onto the new level and drive the foot upwards at toe-off. The shank was more vertical at toe-off to ensure that the ankle energy would drive the limb upwards, rather than forward into the surface. The vertical hip translation energy increased over 300%, acting to pull upwards on the hip to increase trail limb elevation. The increased hip translational energy could be due to extension of the lead limb after it was placed on the surface and/or the piston-like drive of the increased rotational energy at the trail ankle during late stance. The findings add to the knowledge of whole body coordination strategies during anticipatory locomotor adjustments when the entire body is raised to a new level."

  "title": "Dropped head syndrome in severe intractable epilepsies with mental retardation",
  "date": "2005 Jun",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Dropped head syndrome is characterized by a gradual forward sagging of the head due to the isolated weakness of the neck extensor muscles. The syndrome has a relatively benign clinical course. To date, there have been no reports of dropped head syndrome in epileptic patients.\nMethods: Nine patients with intractable epilepsy (mean age, 33.6+/-9.91 years), each presenting with apparent dropped head, were evaluated. The duration of the drooping head symptom varied from 3 to 15 years (mean, 7.4+/-4.06 years), with a slowly progressing weakness in most of the patients. In all of the patients, extensive clinical, laboratory, electrophysiological, histopathological, and neuroimaging examinations were performed.\nResults: The weakness in all of the subjects was strictly limited to the cervical paraspinal muscles. Laboratory studies produced normal results from all subjects. EMG and muscle biopsy were normal or revealed subtle nonspecific myopathic changes without inflammation in the cervical paraspinal muscles. Polymyographic investigation revealed that none of the patients had convincing dystonic spasms of the anterior neck muscles. No atrophy or fatty changes of the neck extensor muscles were observed on CT or MRI. In most of the patients (7/9), altered L-carnitine concentrations were observed (four patients displayed a marked decrease in plasma carnitine concentrations, and three other patients showed abnormalities in urinary excretion of carnitine).\nConclusions: These findings seem to suggest that a secondary carnitine deficiency, induced by antiepileptic drugs (principally valproic acid), represents a plausible pathogenetic mechanism for the development of dropped head in some epileptic patients."

  "title": "Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome and the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene",
  "date": "2005 Jul",
  "abstract": "Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome was among the first of the X-linked mental retardation syndromes to be described (in 1944) and among the first to be regionally mapped on the X chromosome (in 1990). Six large families with the syndrome have been identified, and linkage studies have placed the gene locus in Xq13.2. Mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene (MCT8) have been found in each of the six families. One essential function of the protein encoded by this gene appears to be the transport of triiodothyronine into neurons. Abnormal transporter function is reflected in elevated free triiodothyronine and lowered free thyroxine levels in the blood. Infancy and childhood in the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome are marked by hypotonia, weakness, reduced muscle mass, and delay of developmental milestones. Facial manifestations are not distinctive, but the face tends to be elongated with bifrontal narrowing, and the ears are often simply formed or cupped. Some patients have myopathic facies. Generalized weakness is manifested by excessive drooling, forward positioning of the head and neck, failure to ambulate independently, or ataxia in those who do ambulate. Speech is dysarthric or absent altogether. Hypotonia gives way in adult life to spasticity. The hands exhibit dystonic and athetoid posturing and fisting. Cognitive development is severely impaired. No major malformations occur, intrauterine growth is not impaired, and head circumference and genital development are usually normal. Behavior tends to be passive, with little evidence of aggressive or disruptive behavior. Although clinical signs of thyroid dysfunction are usually absent in affected males, the disturbances in blood levels of thyroid hormones suggest the possibility of systematic detection through screening of high-risk populations."

  "title": "Head stabilization on a continuously oscillating platform: the effect of a proprioceptive disturbance on the balancing strategy",
  "date": "2005 Aug",
  "abstract": "When standing and balancing on a continuously and predictably moving platform, body equilibrium relies on both anticipatory control and proprioceptive feedback. We have vibrated different postural muscles of the body to assess any effect of confounding the proprioceptive input on balance during such unstable conditions. Low and high platform oscillation frequencies were used, because different strategies are used to withstand the two perturbations. Eyes open (EO) and closed (EC) conditions were also tested, to assess whether the stabilizing effect of vision is independent from the proprioceptive disturbance. Subjects (n = 14) performed two series of trials, EO and EC: (1) quiet erect stance, (2) stance on the platform translating at 0.2 or 0.6 Hz sinusoidally in the anteroposterior (A-P) direction (dynamic conditions). Continuous bilateral vibration (90 Hz) was produced by two vibrators fixed to the following homonymous muscles: dorsal neck, quadriceps, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and triceps surae. Acquisition of body segments' displacement began 10 s after the start of platform translation. From markers fixed to head, hip, and malleolus, we computed the A-P oscillation of head and hip, body orientation in space, and cross-correlation (CC) and time-delay between malleolus and head trajectories. The results were (a) the head A-P oscillation was smaller with EO than EC, under both quiet stance and dynamic conditions; (b) vibration of tibialis and triceps surae, but not of other muscles, slightly increased head and body A-P oscillation with EC under dynamic conditions; (c) at 0.2 Hz but not at 0.6 Hz, for all visual and vibration conditions, there was a significant association between head and feet; (d) at 0.2 Hz, EC, neck muscle vibration increased this association, whereas vibration of the other muscles induced a major time delay in the oscillation of head compared with feet; (e) vibration of either neck or tibialis induced forward body leaning, while vibration of either triceps surae or biceps femoris induced backward leaning, with both EO and EC, under both static and dynamic conditions; (f) the head A-P oscillation, however, under dynamic conditions was not dependent on body leaning. The relatively scarce effects of proprioceptive disturbance on head stabilization and multijoint coordination (in spite of effects on body orientation similar to those observed during stance) speak for a major role of anticipatory control in the dynamic equilibrium task. However, the significant vibration-induced time delay in segments' coordination at low translation frequency, EC, suggests that the normally patterned Ia input promotes continuous adjustments of the feed-forward control mode."

  "date": "2005 Mar-Apr",
  "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the presence of a \"functionally normal\" cervical lordosis and identify if this and the amount of forward head posture are related to neck complaints.\nMethods: Using the posterior tangent method, an angle of cervical lordosis was measured from C2 through C7 vertebrae on 277 lateral cervical x-rays. Anterior weight bearing was measured as the horizontal distance of the posterior superior body of the C2 vertebra compared to a vertical line drawn superiorly from the posterior inferior body of the C7 vertebra. The measurements were sorted into 2 groups, cervical complaint and noncervical complaint groups. The data were then partitioned into age by decades, sex, and angle categories.\nResults: Patients with lordosis of 20 degrees or less were more likely to have cervicogenic symptoms (P < .001). The association between cervical pain and lordosis of 0 degrees or less was significant (P < .0001). The odds that a patient with cervical pain had a lordosis of 0 degrees or less was 18 times greater than for a patient with a noncervical complaint. Patients with cervical pain had less lordosis and this was consistent over all age ranges. Males had larger median cervical lordosis than females (20 degrees vs 14 degrees) (2-sided Mann-Whitney U test, P = .016). When partitioned by age grouping, this trend is significant only in the 40- to 49-year-old range (2-sided Mann-Whitney U test, P < .01).\nConclusion: We found a statistically significant association between cervical pain and lordosis < 20 degrees and a \"clinically normal\" range for cervical lordosis of 31 degrees to 40 degrees. Maintenance of a lordosis in the range of 31 degrees to 40 degrees could be a clinical goal for chiropractic treatment."

  "abstract": "Objective: To describe the treatment of a patient with chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WADs) previously unresponsive to multiple physical therapy and chiropractic treatments, which resolved following Clinical Biomechanics of Posture (CBP) rehabilitation methods.\nClinical features: A 40-year-old man involved in a high-speed rear-impact collision developed chronic WADs including cervicothoracic, shoulder, and arm pain and headache. The patient was diagnosed with a confirmed chip fracture of the C5 vertebra and cervical and thoracic disk herniations. He was treated with traditional chiropractic and physical therapy modalities but experienced only temporary symptomatic reduction and was later given a whole body permanent impairment rating of 33% by an orthopedic surgeon.\nIntervention and outcome: The patient was treated with CBP mirror-image cervical spine adjustments, exercise, and traction to reduce forward head posture and cervical kyphosis. A presentation of abnormal head protrusion resolved and cervical kyphosis returned to lordosis posttreatment. His initial neck disability index was 46% and 0% at the end of care. Verbal pain rating scales also improved for neck pain (from 5/10 to 0/10).\nConclusion: A patient with chronic WADs and abnormal head protrusion, cervical kyphosis, and disk herniation experienced an improvement in symptoms and function after the use of CBP rehabilitation protocols when other traditional chiropractic and physical therapy procedures showed little or no lasting improvement."

  "title": "The vestibular control of balance after stroke",
  "date": "2005 May",
  "abstract": "Objectives: To examine vestibular control of balance in those who recovered the ability to stand after middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke.\nMethods: Sixteen patients with MCA stroke were compared with 10 age matched controls. Two additional patients were studied with isolated corticospinal tract lesions, one each at the level of the pons and medulla. Vestibular evoked postural responses were obtained using galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) while patients stood with their eyes closed and head facing forwards, equally loading both legs. The GVS response was characterised by measuring the amplitude of the stimulus evoked lateral forces acting through each leg and the lateral displacement of the axial skeleton.\nResults: Lateral displacement and net lateral force following GVS were significantly larger after stroke. Unlike controls, the lateral forces in the stroke group were asymmetrical, being enhanced on the side of the non-paretic limb and small on the side of the paretic limb. The degree of GVS evoked asymmetry correlated with corticospinal damage assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation. A similar asymmetrical response was seen in the patient with the pontine lesion but not the patient with the medullary lesion.\nConclusions: MCA stroke may disrupt corticobulbar projections to brainstem output pathways involved in vestibular control of balance. These projections are either collaterals of the corticospinal tract or lie close to that tract and terminate in the pons/upper medulla. This hypothesis accounts for the association between corticospinal tract damage and GVS response asymmetry, and the lack of GVS evoked asymmetry with corticospinal lesions below the rostral medulla."

  "date": "2005 Apr",
  "abstract": "The gain of the vertical angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) was adapted in side-down and prone positions in two monkeys and tested in four planes: left-/right-side down; forward/backward; and two intermediate planes that lie approximately in the planes of the vertical semicircular canal pairs, left anterior/right posterior (LA/RP) and right anterior/left posterior (RA/LP). Gain changes, expressed as a percent of preadapted values, were plotted as a function of head orientation in the planes of tilt, and fitted with sinusoids to obtain the gravity-dependent (amplitude) and gravity-independent (bias) components of adaptation. Gravity-dependent gain changes were always maximal when tested in a plane that included the head orientation in which the aVOR gain had been adapted. Changes were minimal when the head was tilted in a plane orthogonal to the plane of adaptation, and were smaller but still significant when tested in the two intermediate planes. Gravity-independent VOR gain changes were uniform over all planes of head tilt. Thus, the gravity-dependent and gravity-independent components could be separated experimentally. The aVOR gain changes from the head tilts in different directions were utilized to reconstruct the gain changes in three dimensions. They formed a continuous surface, which peaked in and around the position of adaptation. These studies support the postulate that gain adaptation has both gravity-independent and gravity-dependent components, and further show that these gain changes have a three-dimensional structure. These results are similar to those in humans, indicating that the gravity-dependent adaptation of the aVOR is likely to be a common phenomenon across species."

  "title": "Effects of initial seated position in low speed rear-end impacts: a comparison with the TNO rear impact dummy (TRID) model",
  "date": "2005 Mar",
  "abstract": "Injury-producing mechanisms associated with rear-end impact collision has remained a mystery not withstanding numerous investigations devoted to its scrutiny. Several criteria have been proposed to predict the injury-causing mechanism, but none have been universally accepted. The challenge lies in determining a set of testing procedures representative of real-world collisions, wherein the results obtained are not only the same as human testing, but remain consistent with various subjects and impact conditions. It is hypothesized that one of the most important considerations in the testing methodology is the effect of initial seated position (ISP) on occupant kinematics during a rear impact collision. This study involves two parts that evaluates the effects of ISP during rear-end impact. In the first part, head acceleration results of computer simulation using Hybrid III TNO rear impact dummy (TRID) are compared to physical impact testing (PIT) of humans. The second part focuses on the computer simulation using TRID to obtain different neck parameters such as NIC (Neck Injury Criterion), NIJ (Neck Injury Predictor), neck forces and moments to predict the level of neck injury such as whiplash associated disorder (WAD) during low speed rear-end impact. In PIT, a total of 17 rear-impact tests were conducted with a nominal 8-km/hour change in velocity to 5 subjects in four different seated positions comprising of a normal position (NP) and three out of positions (OOP). The first position was a NP, defined as torso against the seat back, looking straight ahead, hands on the steering wheel, and feet on the floor. The second position was a head flex position (HFP), defined as the normal position with head flexed forward approximately 20 degrees. The third position was a torso lean position (TLP), defined as the normal position with torso leaned forward approximately 10 degrees away from the seat back. Lastly, a torso lean head flex position (TLHFP), defined as the normal position with the head flexed forward approximately 20 degrees and torso leaned forward approximately 10 degrees. The head acceleration plots from PIT reveal that for the third and fourth positions (TLP and TLHFP) when the subject torso leaned forward, the peak head acceleration for the subject decreased and there was also a delay in reaching the peak. The Hybrid III-TRID anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD) was used in the same four different seated positions using computer simulation software MAthematical DYnamic MOdel (MADYMO 6.0) and the head acceleration results were compared to PIT. The comparison demonstrates that the Hybrid III-TRID ATD with MADYMO can be a reliable testing procedure during low-speed, rear-end impact for the four ISPs considered since the head acceleration plots deviated within the range of PIT head acceleration plots for different human subjects. This ensures that the second part of the study with neck injury using computer simulation results is a reliable testing procedure. It can be observed that MADYMO results have a greater error when compared to PIT when more than one OOP condition is employed as in TLHFP. All these observations would help in providing a tool to better understand the injury mechanisms and provide an accurate testing procedure for rear-end impact."

  "date": "2005 Jan",
  "abstract": "Although it is commonly accepted that there is an interrelationship between the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and head posture, few, if any, previous studies have quantified this effect. The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect of a change in the condyle fossa relationship of symptomatic temporomandibular joints on head posture. Charts of 51 patients (N=10 men and N=41 women) with symptomatic TMJ pathology were reviewed. The condyle fossa relationships were measured pre- and posttreatment using sagittal corrected hypocycloidal tomography. The amount of slant between the shoulder and external auditory meatus (EAM) was measured in pre- and posttreatment photographs as an indicator of forward head posture; less slant indicates better posture. Subjects ranged in age from 13-74 years (mean=43.1) and had been treated for an average of 5 months. Comparisons with pre-treatment measures showed that after treatment, the amount of retrodiskal space was significantly increased by an average of 1.67 mm on the left side (t=-10.11, p<0.0001) and 1.92 mm on the right (t=-9.62, p<0.0001). Comparisons also showed that after treatment, the amount of slant between the shoulder and EAM decreased by 4.43 inches on average which was also significant (t=13.08, p<0.0001). Improvement in the condyle fossa relationship was related to decreased forward head posture. This suggests that optimizing mandibular condyle position should be considered in the management of forward head posture (adaptive posture)."

  "date": "2005 May",
  "abstract": "Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from occipitoscapularis, semispinalis, and splenius neck muscles in five alert squirrel monkeys during 0.25-Hz rotations about horizontal axes oriented at 22.5 degrees intervals, including pitch, roll, and intermediate axes. The animals were oriented in either upright or upside down posture. In the upright posture, all monkeys exhibited compensatory EMG activity with maximal activation during rotations about axes between pitch in the pitch forward direction and contralaterally directed roll. Response timing varied across animals with EMG peaks ranging from near pitch forward head velocity to near pitch forward head position. When the head was upside down, response dynamics and directionality were altered to varying degrees in different monkeys. The greatest change in response to head inversion was seen in the monkey that had response phases closest to head position, the least in the animal with phases closest to head velocity. The monkey with EMG response peaks closest to position phase showed nearly 180 degrees inversion of responses when the head was upside down, suggesting that in this monkey a righting reflex mediated by utricular signals was activated in the upside down posture. The monkey with EMG response peaks closest to velocity phase may have lacked a righting response and exhibited only a canal-mediated compensatory vestibulocervical reflex in both upright and upside down postures. The results suggest that reflex contraction of neck muscles in response to passive head rotation includes an interplay of compensatory and righting responses that varies from animal to animal."

  "title": "Otolith and canal reflexes in human standing",
  "date": "2005 Feb 15",
  "abstract": "We used galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to identify human balance reflexes of the semicircular canals and otolith organs. The experiment used a model of vestibular signals arising from GVS modulation of the net signal from vestibular afferents. With the head upright, the model predicts that the GVS-evoked canal signal indicates lateral head rotation while the otolith signal indicates lateral tilt or acceleration. Both signify body sway transverse to the head. With the head bent forward, the model predicts that the canal signal indicates body spin about a vertical axis but the otolith signal still signifies lateral body motion. Thus, we compared electromyograms (EMG) in the leg muscles and body sway evoked by GVS when subjects stood with the head upright or bent forward. With the head upright, GVS evoked a large sway in the direction of the anodal electrode. This response was abolished with the head bent forward leaving only small, oppositely directed, transient responses at the start and end of the stimulus. With the head upright, GVS evoked short-latency (60-70 ms), followed by medium-latency (120 ms) EMG responses, of opposite polarity. Bending the head forward abolished the medium-latency but preserved the short-latency response. This is compatible with GVS evoking separate otolithic and canal reflexes, indicating that balance is controlled by independent canal and otolith reflexes, probably through different pathways. We propose that the short-latency reflex and small transient sway are driven by the otolith organs and the medium-latency response and the large sway are driven by the semicircular canals."

  "abstract": "Carpet weavers suffer from musculoskeletal problems mainly attributed to poor working postures. Their posture is mostly constrained by the design of workstations. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of 2 design parameters (weaving height and seat type) on postural variables and subjective experience, and to develop guidelines for workstation adjustments. At an experimental workstation, 30 professional weavers worked in 9 different conditions. Working posture and weavers' perceptions were measured. It was shown that head, neck and shoulder postures were influenced by weaving height. Both design parameters influenced trunk and elbows postures. The determinant factor for weavers' perception on the neck, shoulders and elbows was found to be weaving height, and on the back and knees it was seat type. Based on the results, the following guidelines were developed: (a) weaving height should be adjusted to 20 cm above elbow height; (b) a 10 degrees forward-sloping high seat is to be used at weaving workstations."

  "date": "2005 Mar",
  "abstract": "Spatial orientation is crucial when subjects have to accurately reach memorized visual targets. In previous studies modified gravitoinertial force fields were used to affect the accuracy of pointing movements in complete darkness without visual feedback of the moving limb. Target mislocalization was put forward as one hypothesis to explain this decrease in accuracy of pointing movements. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by determining the accuracy of spatial localization of memorized visual targets in a perturbed gravitoinertial force field. As head orientation is involved in localization tasks and carrying relevant sensory systems (visual, vestibular and neck muscle proprioceptive), we also tested the effect of head posture on the accuracy of localization. Subjects (n=10) were seated off-axis on a rotating platform (120 degrees s(-1)) in complete darkness with the head fixed (head-fixed session) or free to move (head-free session). They were required to report verbally the egocentric spatial localization of visual memorized targets. They gave the perceived target location in direction (i.e. left or right) and in amplitude (in centimeters) relative to the direction they thought to be straight ahead. Results showed that the accuracy of visual localization decreased when subjects were exposed to inertial forces. Moreover, subjects localized the memorized visual targets more to the right than their actual position, that was in the direction of the inertial forces. With further analysis, it appeared that this shift of localization was concomitant with a shift of the visual straight ahead (VSA) in the opposite direction. Thus, the modified gravitoinertial force field led to a modification in the orientation of the egocentric reference frame. Furthermore, this shift of localization increased when the head was free to move while the head was tilted in roll toward the center of rotation of the platform and turned in yaw in the same direction. It is concluded that the orientation of the egocentric reference frame was influenced by the gravitoinertial vector."

  "date": "2005 Apr",
  "abstract": "The dorsal side-up body orientation in quadrupeds is maintained by a postural control system. We investigated participation of the motor cortex in this system by recording activity of pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) from limb representations of the motor cortex during postural corrections. The cat was standing on the platform periodically tilting in the frontal plane, and maintained equilibrium at different body configurations: with the head directed forward (symmetrically alternating loading of the left and right fore limbs), or with the head voluntary turned to the right or to the left (asymmetrical loading). We found that postural corrective responses to tilts included an increase of the contact forces and activity of limb extensors on the side moving down, and their decrease on the opposite side. The activity of PTNs was strongly modulated in relation to the tilt cycle. Phases of activity of individual PTNs were distributed over the cycle. Thus the cortical output mediated by PTNs appeared closely related to a highly automatic motor activity, the maintenance of the body posture. An asymmetrical loading of limbs, caused by head turns, resulted in the corresponding changes of motor responses to tilts. These voluntary postural modifications were also well reflected in the PTNs' activity. The activity of a part of PTNs correlated well with contact forces, in some others with the limb muscle activity; in still others no correlation with these variables was observed. This heterogeneity of the PTNs population suggests a different functional role of individual PTNs."

  "date": "2005 Jul",
  "abstract": "Neck proprioceptive input, as elicited by muscle vibration, can produce destabilizing effects on stance and locomotion. Neck muscle fatigue produces destabilizing effects on stance, too. Our aim was to assess whether neck muscle fatigue can also perturb the orientation in space during a walking task. Direction and amplitude of the path covered during stepping in place were measured in 10 blindfolded subjects, who performed five 30-s stepping trials before and after a 5-min period of isometric dorsal neck muscle contraction against a load. Neck muscle electromyogram amplitude and median frequency during the head extensor effort were used to compute a fatigue index. Head and body kinematics were recorded by an optoelectronic system, and stepping cadence was measured by sensorized insoles. Before the contraction period, subjects normally stepped on the spot or drifted forward. After contraction, some subjects reproduced the same behavior, whereas others reduced their forward progression or even stepped backward. The former subjects showed minimal signs of fatigue and the latter ones marked signs of fatigue, as quantified by the dorsal neck electromyogram index. Head position and cadence were unaffected in either group of subjects. We argue that the abnormal fatigue-induced afferent input originating in the receptors transducing the neck muscle metabolic state can modulate the egocentric spatial reference frame. Notably, the effects of neck muscle fatigue on orientation are opposite to those produced by neck proprioception. The neck represents a complex source of inputs capable of modifying our orientation in space during a locomotor task."

  "abstract": "We have demonstrated that lower limb extensor muscle response to tibial nerve stimulation is significantly facilitated by whole head-and-body tilt in the forward direction. Our aim was to examine whether this reflex interaction is influenced by age. Reflexes were elicited in lower limb muscles by electrical stimulation (ES) of the right tibial nerve. We compared reflexes during supported stance (ESalone) and sudden forward tilting of the whole head-and-body (Tilt+ES) between 10 healthy subjects aged 66 +/- 4 years and 13 subjects aged 27 +/- 3 years. In young subjects the area of response evoked in the ipsilateral vastus lateralis (iVL) was significantly increased by 74% during Tilt+ES as compared with ESalone (p < 0.05). Moreover, the latency of contralateral VL and soleus muscle responses (cVL and/or cSO) was significantly shorter by 61 ms during Tilt+ES than ESalone (p < 0.01). In contrast, older subjects showed no significant increase in the excitability of iVL muscle response and cVL and/or cSO muscle responses during Tilt+ES as compared with ESalone, despite the application of similar intensity of ES and head acceleration as in young subjects. Our findings showed that the interaction between ES-evoked and tilt-evoked responses in lower limb extensor muscles is modified with age, which suggests modifications of sensorimotor integration involved in balance control."

  "abstract": "The treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) consists of a repositioning maneuver in order to remove otoliths from the posterior semicircular canal and subsequent postural restrictions to prevent debris from reentering the canal. However, the extent to which postural restrictions affect the final outcomes of BPPV is still uncertain. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of postural restrictions in the treatment of BPPV, which is caused by otoliths in the posterior semicircular canal, and to evaluate its usefulness as a therapy. Seventy cases diagnosed as BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal were studied. All patients were treated utilizing the modified Epley maneuver. They were divided into two groups. The first group (group A, 35 patients) was instructed to sleep in a semi-sitting position and to avoid moving their heads forward or backward, whereas no instructions were given to the second group (group B, 35 patients). The information gathered from the patients was analyzed by age of onset, gender, duration of the disease and cure rates or recurrence rates. In group A, the average age was 54.5 years and the mean duration of symptoms was 116.5 days, whereas in group B, these measurements were 54.8 years and 86.7 days. The cure rates were 91.4 and 94.3%, respectively. Symptoms recurred in 12.5% of group A patients, while in group B, there was a 9.1% recurrence rate. Our study did not show any significant difference between the two groups. Postural restriction therapy, practiced after the modified Epley repositioning maneuver, did not have a significant effect on the final outcomes of BPPV. Based on our results, we do not recommend this therapy since there was no significant benefit for the patients who utilized postural restrictions."

  "date": "2004 Sep",
  "abstract": "Objective: To use time course information to improve understanding of the vestibular contribution to postural control as one rises from a chair.\nMaterial and methods: A total of 24 healthy controls and 42 patients with varying degrees of vestibular dysfunction were studied. The time course of the angular motion of the body and head when rising from a chair with eyes open and closed was evaluated. The delay between the onset of the motions of the body and head was compared between subject groups. We also investigated transition points from forward lean of the body to backward reversion and from backward tilt of the head to forward reversion.\nResults: With regard to the onset of chair rise, we found a significant difference in the delay between head and body motion between healthy controls and subjects with bilaterally impaired vestibular deficiency only when the eyes were closed. The time between the transition points of the head and body was stable between these groups.\nConclusion: The mechanisms controlling the onset of head and body movements differ between normal subjects and those with bilateral vestibular deficits. In the latter, the loss of a reference of gravity causes a decrease in feed-forward postural control, which is compensated for by a somato-sensory feedback mechanism. Visual input seems to provide an alternative reference of gravity."

  "title": "Movement patterns and muscular demands during posterior transfers toward an elevated surface in individuals with spinal cord injury",
  "date": "2005 Feb",
  "abstract": "Study design: Three-dimensional kinematic analysis and surface electromyography (EMG) of 10 male adults with complete spinal cord injury (C7 to L2).\nObjective: To examine movement patterns and muscular demands in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) during posterior transfers.\nSetting: Pathokinesiology Laboratory at a Rehabilitation Centre, Montreal, Canada.\nMethods: Kinematic variables that described the positions and angular displacements of the head, trunk, shoulder and elbow were obtained by videotaping markers placed on the subject segments. EMG data were recorded for the biceps, triceps, anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and trapezius muscles of the dominant upper extremity during posterior transfers using surface electrodes. To quantify the muscular demand, the EMG data recorded during the transfers were normalized to values obtained during maximal static contractions (EMGmax). The mean muscular demand was calculated for every muscle during the lift phase of the transfers. The lift phase was determined by pressure-sensitive contacts.\nResults: All subjects were able to execute the posterior transfers on an even surface, whereas nine subjects completed at least one of the transfers to the elevated surface. A forward-flexion pattern at the head and trunk was observed when either one or two hands remained on the lower surface, whereas a lift strategy was seen when both hands were placed on the elevated surface. Transferring to the elevated surface with hands on the lower surface required inferior electromyographic muscular utilization ratio (EMUR) than the transfer on the even surface for all muscles. The lowest EMUR were calculated for the transfer to the elevated surface with hands on the lower surface (triceps (18%), pectoralis major (53.8%), trapezius (66%) and latissimus dorsi (24.5%)) while performing the same transfer with hands on the elevated surface generated the highest EMUR (triceps (40.2%), anterior deltoid (73.2%), trapezius (83.6%) and latissimus dorsi (55.3%)).\nConclusions: Subjects presented different movement characteristics and muscular demands during the posterior transfers. It is suggested that the forward-flexion pattern improves the dynamic trunk stability and reduces the muscular demand required to transfer. High muscular demand developed when hands were positioned on the elevated surface might be due to increased postural control demands on the upper limb and reduced angular momentum."

  "date": "2004 Jul-Aug",
  "abstract": "Objective: To discuss the management of upper crossed syndrome and cervicogenic headache with chiropractic care, myofascial release, and exercise.\nClinical features: A 56-year-old male writer had been having constant 1-sided headaches radiating into the right eye twice weekly for the past 5 years. Tenderness to palpation was elicited from the occiput to T4 bilaterally. Trigger points were palpated in the pectoralis major, levator scapulae, upper trapezius, and supraspinatus muscles bilaterally. Range of motion in the cervical region was decreased in all ranges and was painful. Visual examination demonstrated severe forward translation of the head, rounded shoulders, and right cervical translation.\nIntervention and outcome: The patient was adjusted using high-velocity, short-lever arm manipulation procedures (diversified technique) and was given interferential myofascial release and cryotherapy 3 times weekly for 2 weeks. He progressed to stretching and isometric exercise, McKenzie retraction exercises, and physioball for proprioception, among other therapies. The patient's initial headache lasted 4 days. He had a second headache for 1.5 days during his exercise training. During the next 7 months while returning to the clinic twice monthly for an elective chiropractic maintenance program, his headaches did not recur. He also had improvement on radiograph.\nConclusion: The principles of upper crossed syndrome and the use of exercise, chiropractic care, and myofascial release in the treatment of cervicogenic headache are discussed. A review of the literature indicates that analyzing muscle imbalance as well as vertebral subluxation may increase the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for cervicogenic headache."

  "title": "Shoulder posture and median nerve sliding",
  "date": "2004 Jul 28",
  "abstract": "Background: Patients with upper limb pain often have a slumped sitting position and poor shoulder posture. Pain could be due to poor posture causing mechanical changes (stretch; local pressure) that in turn affect the function of major limb nerves (e.g. median nerve). This study examines (1) whether the individual components of slumped sitting (forward head position, trunk flexion and shoulder protraction) cause median nerve stretch and (2) whether shoulder protraction restricts normal nerve movements.\nMethods: Longitudinal nerve movement was measured using frame-by-frame cross-correlation analysis from high frequency ultrasound images during individual components of slumped sitting. The effects of protraction on nerve movement through the shoulder region were investigated by examining nerve movement in the arm in response to contralateral neck side flexion.\nResults: Neither moving the head forward or trunk flexion caused significant movement of the median nerve. In contrast, 4.3 mm of movement, adding 0.7% strain, occurred in the forearm during shoulder protraction. A delay in movement at the start of protraction and straightening of the nerve trunk provided evidence of unloading with the shoulder flexed and elbow extended and the scapulothoracic joint in neutral. There was a 60% reduction in nerve movement in the arm during contralateral neck side flexion when the shoulder was protracted compared to scapulothoracic neutral.\nConclusion: Slumped sitting is unlikely to increase nerve strain sufficient to cause changes to nerve function. However, shoulder protraction may place the median nerve at risk of injury, since nerve movement is reduced through the shoulder region when the shoulder is protracted and other joints are moved. Both altered nerve dynamics in response to moving other joints and local changes to blood supply may adversely affect nerve function and increase the risk of developing upper quadrant pain."

  "title": "Effect of microgravity on spatial orientation and posture regulation during Coriolis stimulation",
  "date": "2004 May",
  "abstract": "Objective: To elucidate spatial orientation and posture regulation under conditions of microgravity.\nMaterial and methods: Coriolis stimulation was done with five normal subjects on the ground (1 g) and onboard an aircraft (under conditions of microgravity during parabolic flight). Subjects were asked to tilt their heads forward during rotation at speeds of 0, 50, 100 and 150 degrees/s on the ground and 100 degrees/s during flight. Body sway was recorded using a 3D linear accelerometer and eye movements using an infrared charge-coupled device video camera. Flight experiments were performed on 5 consecutive days, and 11-16 parabolic maneuvers were done during each flight. Two subjects boarded each flight and were examined alternately at least five times.\nResults: Coriolis stimulation at 1 g caused body sway, nystagmus and a movement sensation in accordance with inertial inputs at 1 g. Neither body sway, excepting a minute sway due to the Coriolis force, nor a movement sensation occurred in microgravity, but nystagmus was recorded.\nConclusions: Posture, eye movement and sensation at 1 g are controlled with reference to spatial coordinates that represent the external world in the brain. Normal spatial coordinates are not relevant in microgravity because there is no Z-axis, and the posture regulation and sensation that depend on them collapse. The discrepancy in responses between posture and eye movement under conditions of microgravity may be caused by a different constitution of the effectors which adjust posture and gaze."

The influence of reclining and anteversion, tilting and rotation of the head on the quality of the endoscopic images was determined.\nResults: The vocal tract became wider and the view onto the glottis could be improved by reclining the head and anteversion of the chin. On rotation of the head, the hypopharynx of the same side became narrower. This is well known and is used worldwide in the therapy of dysphagia.\nDiscussion: Positioning of the patient is important in laryngoscopy. Reclining the head and forward inclination of the trunk (horizontal axis of the mouth) seems to be the best position for obtaining an optimal view onto the glottis."

  "date": "2004 Apr",
  "abstract": "Forward dynamic simulations of a toe-rise task were developed to explore the outcomes of plantar fasciotomy, a surgery commonly performed to relieve heel pain. The specific objectives of this study were to develop such a simulation, validate its predictions, and simulate rising on toes using a model from which the plantar fascia had been removed. Root-mean squared differences between the intact model and measurements of healthy subjects were found to be 0.009 body weights (BW) and 0.055 BW for the horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces and 7.1 mm, 11.3 mm, and 0.48 deg for the horizontal, vertical and rotational positions of the pelvis. Simulated plantar fasciotomy increased passive arch torques by 7.4%, increased metatarsal head contact forces by 18%, and resulted in greater toe flexor activity. These simulations may explain the mechanisms behind plantar fasciotomy complications when patients perform activities that require loading of the plantarflexors and the longitudinal arch."

  "title": "Recovery of the locomotor function after prolonged microgravity exposure. I. Head-trunk movement and locomotor equilibrium during various tasks",
  "date": "2004 Sep",
  "abstract": "Recovery of locomotor function was investigated in seven cosmonauts exposed to microgravity for 6 months. Crew members executed a locomotor task with visual cues (eyes open, EO) and without them (eyes closed, EC). The locomotor task consisted of ascending a two-step staircase, jumping down from a 30-cm high platform, and finally walking 4 m in the straight-ahead direction. Subjects were tested before the flight (D-30), and on the second day (R+2) and the sixth day (R+6) after the flight. Cosmonauts succeeded in all locomotor sub-tasks as early as R+2. In particular, microgravity exposure did not prevent cosmonauts from producing a straight walking trajectory even when blindfolded (deviation at R+2 with EO 2.0+/-0.7 degrees, and with EC 4.7+/-1.9 degrees ). However, lateral movements of trunk were found to be increased at R+2 (16%), suggesting post-flight gait instability. Modifications of the timing of forward trunk movements were also detected at R+2. Unexpectedly, coordination patterns between head and trunk movements remained unchanged. The maximum amplitude of head pitches was 5 degrees or less. Yet, the cosmonauts held their heads at lower positions at R+2 in comparison with their pre-flight postures, and they lowered their heads even further during blindfolded locomotion. In general, comparable spatial and temporal modifications of head and trunk movements at R+2 were observed during the stair and gait cycles. Mean values of locomotor descriptors measured at R+6 did not deviate from the pre-flight baseline. When performing jumps after the return from their flight, cosmonauts decreased the amplitude and speed of head rotation by approximately 50% in comparison with the pre-flight values. In addition, the timing of head pitches was uncertain after weightlessness. All the above changes endured at R+6. Previous studies reported that prolonged exposure to microgravity adversely affects the motor performance in the initial hours upon re-entry to Earth. However, gait analysis revealed that cosmonauts recovered near-optimal locomotor abilities as early as the second day post-flight. Results suggest a notable capability of the central nervous system to rapidly accommodate to changing physical environment and body properties. The role of head stabilization at a lower position is conjectured to be an adaptive response to microgravity-induced motor disorders."

  "title": "The influence of artificially increased hip and trunk stiffness on balance control in man",
  "date": "2004 Aug",
  "abstract": "Lightweight corsets were used to produce mid-body stiffening, rendering the hip and trunk joints practically inflexible. To examine the effect of this artificially increased stiffness on balance control, we perturbed the upright stance of young subjects (20-34 years of age) while they wore one of two types of corset or no corset at all. One type, the \"half-corset\", only increased hip stiffness, and the other, the \"full-corset\", increased stiffness of the hips and trunk. The perturbations consisted of combined roll and pitch rotations of the support surface (7.5 deg, 60 deg/s) in one of six different directions. Outcome measures were biomechanical responses of the legs, trunk, arms and head, and electromyographic (EMG) responses from leg, trunk, and upper arm muscles. With the full-corset, a decrease in forward stabilising trunk pitch rotation compared to the no-corset condition occurred for backward pitch tilts of the support surface. In contrast, the half-corset condition yielded increased forward trunk motion. Trunk backward pitch motion after forwards support-surface perturbations was the same for all corset conditions. Ankle torques and lower leg angle changes in the pitch direction were decreased for both corset conditions for forward pitch tilts of the support-surface but unaltered for backward tilts. Changes in trunk roll motion with increased stiffness were profound. After onset of a roll support-surface perturbation, the trunk rolled in the opposite direction to the support-surface tilt for the no-corset and half-corset conditions, but in the same direction as the tilt for the full-corset condition. Initial head roll angular accelerations (at 100 ms) were larger for the full-corset condition but in the same direction (opposite platform tilt) for all conditions. Arm roll movements were initially in the same direction as trunk movements, and were followed by large compensatory arm movements only for the full-corset condition. Leg muscle (soleus, peroneus longus, but not tibialis anterior) balance-correcting responses were reduced for roll and pitch tilts under both corset conditions. Responses in paraspinals were also reduced. These results indicate that young healthy normals cannot rapidly modify movement strategies sufficiently to account for changes in link flexibility following increases in hip and trunk stiffness. The changes in leg and trunk muscle responses failed to achieve a normal roll or pitch trunk end position at 700 ms (except for forward tilt rotations), even though head accelerations and trunk joint proprioception seemed to provide information on changed trunk movement profiles over the first 300 ms following the perturbation. The major adaptation to stiffness involved increased use of arm movements to regain stability. The major differences in trunk motion for the no-corset, half-corset and full-corset conditions support the concept of a multi-link pendulum with different control dynamics in the pitch and roll planes as a model of human stance. Stiffening of the hip and trunk increases the likelihood of a loss of balance laterally and/or backwards. Thus, these results may have implications for the elderly and others, with and without disease states, who stiffen for a variety of reasons."

  "date": "2004 Apr",
  "abstract": "Mouth breathing may cause changes in muscle activity, because an upper airway obstruction leads may cause a person to extend his/her head forward, demanding a higher inspiratory effort on the accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoids). This purpose of this study is to compare, using electromyography (EMG), the activity pattern the sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscles in mouth breathing children and nasal breathing children. Forty-six children, ages 8-12 years, 33 male and 13 female were included. The selected children were divided into two groups: Group I consisted of 26 mouth breathing children, and Group II, 20 nasal breathing children. EMG recordings were made using surface electrodes bilaterally in the areas of the sternocleidomastoideus and upper trapezius muscles, while relaxed and during maximal voluntary contraction. The data were analyzed using the Kruskall-Wallis statistical test. The results indicated higher activity during relaxation and lower activity during maximal voluntary contraction in mouth breathers when compared to the nasal breathers. It is suggested that the activity pattern of the sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscles differs between mouth breathing children and nasal breathing children. This may be attributed to changes in body posture which causes muscular imbalance. Because of the limitations of surface EMG, the results need to be confirmed by adding force measurements and repeating the experiments with matched subjects."

  "title": "[Primary neurogenic and myogenic disorders of posture]",
  "date": "2004 May",
  "abstract": "Disturbance of posture may occur in a variety of neurological disorders and occasionally is the presenting or even the only sign. In the majority of cases, the head or the trunk or both are bent forward (bent spine syndrome, dropped head syndrome). A feature of these primary neurogenic or myogenic postural disturbances that is in contrast to antalgic contraction or ankylosis is that they are not fixed, but the trunk or head are easily erected by the examiner and show a characteristic sagging. Neuromuscular disorders are a frequent cause. They may be confined to the paraspinal muscles. Axial computed tomography of the spine, electromyography of the involved muscles, and muscle biopsy help to make the diagnosis. However, also central movement disorders may lead to a sagging of the head or trunk or of both due to a lessened tone of the head and trunk extensors. This is frequently seen in the various parkinsonian syndromes which may, however, occur in association with a focal myopathy of the paraspinal muscles. Occasionally, sagging of the trunk is seen as a side effect of neuropharmacologic medication. Sagging of the trunk or head should be differentiated from a pathologically increased innervation of the ventral muscles in dystonic movement disorders such as antecollis or camptocormia. Pathologic reclination of the head or trunk or both is a rare disturbance of posture. It may occur in dystonia (retrocollis) or, occasionally, as a consequence of musculotendinous contractures secondary to certain neuromuscular disorders such as the rigid spine syndrome."

  "title": "Gait analysis in patients with idiopathic scoliosis",
  "date": "2004 Aug",
  "abstract": "Introduction: The goal of this study was to observe scoliotic subjects during level walking to identify asymmetries--which may be related to a neurological dysfunction or the spinal deformity itself-and to correlate these to the severity of the scoliotic curve.\nMethods: We assessed the gait pattern of ten females (median age 14.4) with idiopathic scoliosis characterised by a left-lumbar and a right-thoracic curve component. Gait analysis consisted of 3D kinematic (VICON) and kinetic (Kistler force plates) measurements. The 3D-segment positions of the head, trunk and pelvis, as well as the individual joint angles of the upper and lower extremities, were computed during walking and static standing. Calculation of pertinent kinetic and kinematic parameters allowed statistical comparison.\nResults: All subjects walked at a normal velocity (median: 1.22 m/s; range:1.08-1.30 m/s; height-adjusted velocity: 0.75 m/s; range: 0.62-0.88 m/s). The timing of the individual gait phases was normal and symmetrical for the whole group. Sagittal plane hip, knee and ankle motion followed a physiological pattern. Significant asymmetry was observed in the trunk's rotational behaviour in the transverse plane. During gait, the pelvis and the head rotated symmetrically to the line of progression, whereas trunk rotation was asymmetric, with increased relative forward rotation of the right upper body in relation to the pelvis. This produced a torsional offset to the line of progression. Minimal torsion (at right heel strike) measured: median 1.0 degree (range: 5.1 degrees -8.3 degrees), and maximal torsion (at left heel strike) measured 11.4 degrees (range 6.9 degrees -17.9 degrees). The magnitude of the torsional offset during gait correlated to the severity of the thoracic deformity and to the standing posture, whereas the range of the rotational movement was not affected by the severity of the deformity. The ground reaction forces revealed a significant asymmetry of [Msz], the free rotational moment around the vertical axis going through the point of equivalent force application. On the right side, the initial endo-rotational moment was lower, followed by a higher exo-rotational moment than on the left. All the other force parameters (vertical, medio-lateral, anterior-posterior), did not show a significant side difference for the whole group. The use of a brace stiffened torsional motion. However the torsional offset and the asymmetry of the free rotational moment remained unchanged.\nConclusion: The most significant and marked asymmetry was seen in the transverse plane, denoted as a torsional offset of the upper trunk in relation to the symmetrically rotating pelvis. This motion pattern was reflected by a ground-reaction-force asymmetry of the free rotational moment. Further studies are needed to investigate whether this behaviour is solely an expression of the structural deformity or whether it could enhance the progression of the torsional deformity."

  "abstract": "Background: Children with fragile X syndrome (fraX) are at risk for manifesting abnormalities in social function that overlap with features of autism and social anxiety disorder. In this study, we analyzed brain activation in response to face and gaze stimuli to better understand neural functioning associated with social perception in fraX.\nMethods: Eleven female subjects with fraX, aged 10 to 22 years, were compared with age-matched female control subjects. Photographs of forward-facing and angled faces, each having direct and averted gaze (4 types of stimuli), were presented in an event-related design during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were instructed to determine the direction of gaze for each photograph. Activation in brain regions known to respond to face and gaze stimuli, the fusiform gyrus (FG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS), were compared between groups to isolate neural abnormalities in the perception of directed social stimuli.\nResults: The fraX subjects had decreased accuracy in determining the direction of gaze compared with controls. Region of interest analysis of the FG revealed a significant interaction between diagnostic group and face orientation. Specifically, control subjects had greater FG activation to forward than to angled faces, whereas fraX subjects had no difference in FG activation to forward and angled faces. Controls showed greater left STS activation to all stimuli compared with fraX subjects.\nConclusions: Our results suggest that gaze aversion in fraX subjects is related to decreased specialization of the FG in the perception of face orientation. Decreased STS activation in fraX suggests aberrant processing of gaze. These data suggest that gaze aversion in fraX may be related to dysfunction of neural systems underlying both face and gaze processing."

  "title": "Is the use of vestibular information weighted differently across the initiation of walking?",
  "date": "2004 Aug",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this experiment was to examine vestibular contributions at specific times during the initiation of walking in human subjects. Subjects began walking forward at the sound of an auditory tone, with vision present or occluded. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was delivered with the anode electrode on the right or left side at either: (1) onset of the anticipatory postural adjustment (APA), (2) toe-off of the first swing limb (TO) or (3) heel contact of the first swing limb (HC). Ground reaction forces and kinematic data were collected. Upper body (roll angles from head, trunk and pelvis) and lower body (foot placement) data were analysed to determine whether the timing and magnitude of the response to GVS, and therefore the level of vestibular contribution, was modulated at different points during the initiation of gait. With vision present and occluded, the magnitude of the lower body response varied depending on the event in the gait cycle at which the stimulation was delivered. These novel results demonstrate evidence that vestibular weighting during gait initiation is dependent upon the specific gait initiation events. Upper body roll also exhibited magnitude differences between events. However, these changes are proposed to occur due to the transition from a stationary position into a dynamic state, prompting the increased weighting of vestibular information. With vision present no significant changes were seen in the segment roll response. The observations suggest a distinction in vestibular regulation of upper body roll versus foot placement for successful completion of the gait initiation task. Changes in upper body roll are influenced by the dynamic nature of the task, whereas foot placement changes are modulated based on the event during gait initiation at which GVS is delivered."

  "date": "2003 Fall",
  "abstract": "We conducted 2 experiments to investigate the clutter-scan trade-off between the cost of increasing clutter by overlaying complex information onto the forward field of view using a helmet-mounted display (HMD) and the cost of scanning when presenting this information on a handheld display. In the first experiment, this trade-off was examined in terms of the spatial accuracy of target cuing data in a relatively sparse display; in the second, the spatial accuracy of the cue was varied more radically in an information-rich display. Participants were asked to detect and identify targets hidden in the far domain while performing a monitoring task in the near domain using either an HMD or a handheld display. The results revealed that on a sparse display, the reduced scanning from the HMD presentation of cuing out-weighed the costs of clutter for cued targets, regardless of cue precision, but no benefit was found for uncued targets. When the HMD displayed task-irrelevant information, however, target detection was hindered by the extraneous clutter in the forward field of view relative to the handheld display condition, and this cost of clutter increased as the amount of data that needed to be inspected increased. Potential applications of this research include the development of design considerations for head-up displays for aviation and military applications."

  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the head and trunk equilibrium strategies while walking forwards and backwards under different conditions (eyes open vs. closed, hard vs. soft surface) in a sample of 11 consenting healthy adult subjects. Nine markers placed on the subject allowed us to record the kinematics of the head, spine and pelvis segments while walking. The data were acquired and analyzed using an optical TV-image processor (ELITE system). For each locomotor trial, the walking speed as well as the absolute angular dispersions and the anchoring indexes (AI) of six segments around the roll and pitch axes were calculated to assess the head and trunk equilibrium strategies. A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to depict differences between the walking conditions. The results showed that the walking speed was affected by the locomotion tasks (P < 0.05) with values ranging from 1.10 +/- 0.21 m s(-1) for natural conditions (walking forwards on a hard surface, eyes open) to 0.79 +/- 0.15 m s(-1) for the most unusual conditions (walking backwards on a foam support, eyes closed). In general, walking backwards reduced the angular dispersion of the spine segments while the absolute angular dispersions of the head and pelvis did not vary significantly with any factors (P > 0.05). The AI around the roll axis indicated good stabilization in space of the head and pelvis with high positive values and this stability increased while the subject was walking backwards on a soft surface (foam). By contrast, the spinal segments were predominantly stabilized on the underlying segment (negative AI), and this stabilization even increased when the subjects walked backwards on a soft surface. Increasing the locomotion difficulty thus induced a generally rigid ('en bloc') functioning of the spinal segments and increased effectiveness of the head and pelvis stabilization strategies in space, especially when walking backwards on a soft surface."

Eight subjects with unilateral vestibular loss (100% Reduced Vestibular Response from the caloric test) resulting from surgery for vestibular schwannoma and 11 controls were selected for this study. Despite their known vestibulopathy, all VP subjects scored within the normal range on computerized dynamic posturography Sensory Organization Tests. During gait, subjects were given surface perturbations of the right support-phase foot in two possible directions (forward-right and backward-left) at two possible magnitudes (5 and 10 cm) that were randomly mixed with trials having no perturbations. M/L stability was quantified by estimating the length of the M/L moment arm between the support foot and the trunk, and the M/L accelerations of the sternum and the head. The VP group had greater changes (p < 0.05) in their moment arm responses compared to controls. The number of steps that it took for the moment arm oscillations to return to normal and the variability in the moment arms were greater for the VP group. Differences in the sternum and head accelerations between VP and control groups were not as consistent, but there was a trend toward greater response deviations in the VP group for all 4 perturbation types. Increased response magnitude and variability of the VP group is consistent with an increase in their sensory noise of vestibular inputs due to the surgical lesion. Another possibility is a reduced sensitivity to motion inputs. This perturbation approach may prove useful for characterizing subtle vestibulopathies and similar changes in the human orientation mechanism after exposure to microgravity."

  "title": "Preliminary evaluation of a behaviour-based system for assessment of post-operative pain in horses following arthroscopic surgery",
  "date": "2003 Jul",
  "abstract": "Objective: To develop a method for objective assessment of equine post-operative pain.\nStudy design: Prospective nonblinded clinical study.\nAnimals: Twelve adult horses: Group 1 (G1, n = 6), admitted for arthroscopy (under general anaesthesia, with multimodal analgesia); Group 2 (G2, n = 6), 'pain free' controls.\nMaterials and methods: Horses were filmed continuously (CVI, time-lapse video recorder) over 72 hours, from 24 hours pre-surgery (PS) to 48 hours post-recovery (PR) (G1), and over 24 hours (G2). Activity budgets were determined from 24 to 0 hours PS, 0-24 and 24-48 hours PR (G1) and for 24 hours (G2). Using direct observation (DO), active behaviours and postures were recorded at set time points PS and PR (G1) and at two time points (morning/evening) (G2). Heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) were recorded simultaneously. Statistical analysis investigated within-group and between-group time-related changes in behaviour, HR and RR.\nResults: There was no difference in HR or RR between G1 and G2 at any time point. Anaesthetic 'hangover' and hunger-related activity modulated behaviour from 0 to 6 hours PR, when abnormal postures and locomotion occurred in all G1 horses, but no G2 horses. Compared with G1 (0-24 hours PR), G2 spent more time eating (t = -3.34, p < 0.01), more time at the front of the stable (t = -2.42, p < 0.05), and less time exhibiting 'abnormal' behaviour (U = 56, p < 0.01). Comparing PS and PR behaviour, G1 spent less time exploring from 24 to 48 hours PR (t = 3.49, p < 0.05), less time in sternal recumbency (t = -3.8, p < 0.05) and less time moving (t = 3.19, p < 0.05). Horses tended (p < 0.07) to spend less time positioned in the front of the stable PR (less from 24 to 48 hours PR than from 0 to 24 hours PR). Comparing PR (evening) behaviour, G2 spent more time with head above withers (U = 21.5, p < 0.01), and ears forwards (U = 22, p < 0.01). G1 showed time-related changes (all p < 0.05) in time with lower lip tense (S = 15.8), eating (S = 17.08) and with head positioned above withers (S = 18.04). No differences in event behaviours were observed between G1 and G2. Within G1, only olfactory behaviour varied significantly with time (S = 14.52, p < 0.05).\nConclusions: Changes in equine behaviour suggestive of post-operative discomfort were identified using both DO and CVI. Analysis of activity budgets may be a more sensitive method of identifying behavioural changes indicative of equine discomfort than repeated DO of specific events and postures."

  "date": "2003 Aug 1",
  "abstract": "Study design: Trunk sway occurring during clinical stance and gait tasks was compared between a group of subjects with a chronic whiplash injury, resulting from an automobile collision, and a normal collective.\nObjectives: To examine if population specific trunk sway patterns for stance and gait could be identified for chronic whiplash injury patients.\nSummary of background data: Our previous work has established that it is possible to identify specific patterns of stance and gait deficits for vestibular loss (both acute and compensated) patients and those with Parkinson's disease. Our question was whether it was possible to use the same stance and gait tasks to identify patterns of trunk sway differences with respect to those of healthy subjects and individuals with a chronic whiplash injury.\nMethods: Twenty-five subjects with history of whiplash injury and 170 healthy age-matched control subjects participated in the study. Trunk sway angular displacements in chronic whiplash patients were assessed for a number of stance and gait tasks similar to those of the Tinetti and Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance (CTSIB) protocols. We used a lightweight, easy-to-attach, body-worn apparatus to measure trunk angular displacements and velocities in the roll (lateral) and the pitch (forward-backward) planes.\nResults: Data analysis revealed several significant differences between the two groups. A pattern could be identified, showing greater trunk sway for stance tasks and for complex gait tasks that required task-specific gaze control such as walking up and down stairs. Trunk sway was less, however, for simple gait tasks that demanded large head movements but no task-specific gaze control, such as walking while rotating the head.\nConclusions: Subjects who have a chronic whiplash injury show a characteristic pattern of trunk sway that is different from that of other patient groups with balance disorders. Balance was most unstable during gait involving task-specific head movements which possibly enhance a pathologic vestibulo-cervical interaction."

  "date": "2003 Aug",
  "abstract": "Background: Tai chi is a form of exercise derived from the martial art folk traditions of China. The force used in tai chi includes different principles of mechanical advantage. No studies on the kinematic features of tai chi exercise have been published.\nObjective: To analyse the kinematics and electromyographic characteristics of tai chi.\nMethods: An experienced tai chi master was asked to perform a sequence of basic movements: ward off, roll back, press, and push. The movements were videotaped and digitised using a motion analysis system. Electromyographic activities of the lumbar erector spinae, rectus femoris, medial hamstrings, and medial head of gastrocnemius were recorded by surface electrodes. The push movement data were analysed.\nResults: The medial hamstrings and medial head of gastrocnemius muscle groups maintained low activity, with higher electromyographic values in the lumbar erector spinae and substantially higher ones in the rectus femoris during the push movement. Both concentric and eccentric contractions occurred in muscles of the lower limbs, with eccentric contraction occurring mainly in the anti-gravity muscles such as the rectus femoris and the medial head of gastrocnemius. The forward and backward shifts in centre of gravity (CG) were mainly accomplished by increasing and decreasing respectively the joint angles of the bilateral lower limbs rather than by adopting a forward or backward postural lean. The path of the CG in the anteroposterior and mediolateral component was unique, and the sway or deviation from the path was small. The master maintained an upright posture and maintained a low CG (hips, knees, and ankles bent) while travelling slowly and steadily from one position to another.\nConclusion: The eccentric muscle contraction of the lower limbs in the push movement of tai chi may help to strengthen the muscles."

  "title": "Influence of neck proprioception on vibration-induced postural sway",
  "date": "2003 Jun",
  "abstract": "Objective: Several reports have shown that the direction of the postural responses induced by vestibular stimulation is affected by the positions of the neck and torso. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the postural responses to vibratory proprioceptive stimulation of the calf muscles are affected by the position of the head and thus by proprioceptive and vestibular information from the neck and head.\nMaterial and methods: Ten normal subjects were exposed to vibratory proprioceptive stimulation of the calf muscles when the head was maintained in five different positions: in a neutral position facing forwards, with the head turned to the right or left sides or with the head tilted backwards or forwards. Body movements were evaluated by analyzing the anteroposterior and lateral torques induced towards the supporting surface.\nResults: The analysis showed that only the anteroposterior body sway was significantly affected by the position of the head. The anteroposterior postural responses were primarily increased during the tests with the head tilted backwards or forwards, whereas the postural responses were unaffected by head torsion towards the sides. The lateral responses were primarily affected by vision and not by the position of the head.\nConclusions: The findings suggest that the responses evoked by vibratory proprioceptive stimulation of the calf muscles may be affected by different mechanisms, either by purely proprioceptive information or by an interaction between proprioceptive and vestibular information. Moreover, the increasing difference between the test conditions over time suggests that fatigue of the neck muscles may be one of the factors affecting the responses induced by the perturbations."

  "title": "Self-initiating a seated perturbation modifies the neck postural responses in humans",
  "date": "2003 Aug 14",
  "abstract": "When seated subjects are submitted to a linear acceleration, reports indicate that the kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) responses of the head-neck system can be modulated with the magnitude of the linear acceleration. There is no evidence, however, that head kinematics or neck EMG activity can be modulated when specific knowledge and active control about the onset of platform acceleration are available. Sixteen seated subjects were given forward linear accelerations in two different conditions nested within subjects: reactive and predictive. In the reactive condition, the acceleration was initiated following a variable delay unknown to the subjects whereas in the predictive condition, subjects manually self-initiated the perturbation. All neck muscle activities were decreased 50-100 ms after platform movement onset in the predictive condition relative to the reactive condition, whereas head and neck peak angular positions and velocities were not different between the two conditions. These results suggest that feedforward control could use the self-generated timing information of platform movement onset to scale the appropriate neck motor output."

  "date": "2000",
  "abstract": "The upper airway narrowing and changes in head posture and their relationship with apnea severity in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were investigated. In 86 male OSA patients and 37 healthy men, one-night polysomnographic examination was performed and a lateral cephalogram by digital image processing system was taken in each subject. Fifteen variables concerning the upper airway dimensions, area and head postures were measured by using a computer software (NIH Image). The results showed that upper airway dimensions in the OSA group at all levels were significantly smaller than those in the control group and the results hold true when the age and body mass index were well controlled in these two groups. Significant forward inclination of the cervical column was found in the patients with an apnea index (AI) greater than 35 episodes/h. And changes in the head posture variables in the whole study group were significantly correlated with AI and airway dimensions at various levels. It was suggested that there exist significant and extensive upper airway narrowing in OSA patients even in upright position and awake state; And as the apnea severity progresses, patients may assume certain compensatory head postures in an attempt to maintain an adequate airway patency."

  "abstract": "Objective: To describe a novel approach to correcting cervical hyperlordosis and forward head posture in the treatment of mid-thoracic pain using specific rehabilitative equipment\nClinical features: A 27-yr-old male patient had a chief complaint of intense, episodic mid-thoracic pain. A posture examination revealed several abnormalities, including apparent thoracic humping or buckling, along with significantly rounded shoulders. Radiological study resulted in a finding of a 52 degrees cervical lordosis and forward head posture (FHP) validated by 2 separate measurements.\nIntervention and outcome: Treatment included 10 visits in 24 days, consisting of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) combined with a 4-lb headweight device and a figure-8 clavicle brace, followed by positional traction on an intersegmental traction table. Specific instructions for home care were provided to the patient. Post-trial radiographs showed a reduced cervical lordosis of 40 degrees and a reduction in FHP of 12mm, according to 1 of the 2 FHP measurements. An incidental improvement was also recorded for the lumbar lordosis. Patient symptoms were alleviated by the end of the trial period.\nConclusion: This comprehensive approach appeared to correct specific posture abnormalities seen on x-ray, and had an apparent positive effect on the patient's chief complaint. Each procedure in this treatment method needs to be tested separately to determine which procedures had the greatest effect."

  "date": "2003 Jul",
  "abstract": "The trunk plays an obvious and important role in the prey capture behavior of many species of snake, yet trunk function during predatory strikes is poorly understood. Axial kinematics of three thamnophiine snakes (Thamnophis couchii, Thamnophis elegans and Nerodia rhombifer) were studied to quantify differences between sideways-directed and forward-directed attacks and to investigate strike diversity at relatively low phylogenetic levels. Feeding strikes were filmed at 60 Hz, and 13 points along the head and body were digitized. These points were used to calculate body segment displacement, rotation and velocity during predatory strikes. Kinematic analysis revealed significant differences in the foraging modes of these aquatic-feeding species. T. couchii displayed a stereotypical pre-strike posture in which the entire body was arranged in a series of loops directed towards the prey. Forward displacement of body segments sometimes occurred over the entire body in T. couchii but was restricted to the anterior one-third of the trunk in T. elegans and N. rhombifer. T. couchii and N. rhombifer both struck rapidly compared with T. elegans, although N. rhombifer typically had a short strike distance. N. rhombifer struck significantly faster than T. elegans. Aquatic prey capture diversity appears to reflect ecological diversity in thamnophiine snakes."

  "date": "2003 Apr",
  "abstract": "11 healthy young men served as subjects in two experiments on perceptibility of (1) large changes in foot pressure and muscle activity induced by body leaning and (2) sequential changes in pressure at the first toe and the head of the first metatarsalis when leaning forward. The effects of reduced sensitivity on that perceptibility were also studied by repeating the experiments while cooling localized plantar areas of the sole (the head of the first metatarsalis, the first toe, and the heel). Under the normal (noncooled) condition, all subjects accurately perceived maximum pressure at the head of the first metatarsalis, but most subjects misperceived the second large increase in pressure at the first toe and in muscle activity as the first large increase. Under the cooling condition, localized cooling did not affect the perceptibility of maximum pressure at the head of the first metatarsalis or the activity in the tibialis anterior, but the perceptibility of pressure at the first toe and activity of the abductor hallucis were reduced. There were individual differences in perceptibility of activity of the rectus femoris when the heel was cooled. Perceptibility of sequential changes in the pressure was affected differently by the localized cooling of each region. Given these findings, we discussed the role and interrelatedness of pressure sensation in perceiving large and sequential changes in somatosensory information while standing and leaning forward and backward."

  "abstract": "Objective: To study the natural head posture (NHP) of edentulous patients compared with dentate people and to understand NHP shift immediately inserting complete dentures and three months after denture wearing.\nMethods: The NHPs of twenty edentulous patients and twenty-two dentate subjects were recorded with cephalometric technique. The NTPs of edentulous patients were exposed three times, before inserting, right after inserting and three months after inserting dentures. The NHPs of dentate subjects were recorded once as a controlled group. Six angles measured from the radiographs were evaluated for the NHP and three angles and two linear measures for the mandibular position.\nResults: Compared with dentate subjects, the craniomandibular angles of the edentulous patients increased and the camber of the cervical columns decreased, but changes of the NHP were not significant. The mandible showed a significant upward moving (P < 0.05) and an insignificant forward moving. At the time of denture insertion, the camber of the cervical columns significantly increased (P < 0.05). Three months after using the dentures, the craniomandibular angles of the patients obviously decreased. (P < 0.05).\nConclusion: The shift of NHP after denture inserting does exist. The shifted NHP of the patients with dentures is a new balanced posture and closer to the normal position than the NHP of them without dentures."

  "title": "Development of postural adjustments during reaching in sitting children",
  "date": "2003 Jul",
  "abstract": "We evaluated the development of postural adjustments accompanying reaching movements in sitting children. Twenty-nine typically developing children aged, 2-11 years, and ten adults were studied with multiple surface electromyograms (EMGs) and kinematics during reaching in four conditions: sitting with the seat-surface oriented horizontally with and without an additional task load, and sitting with the seat-surface tilted 15 degrees forward and 15 degrees backward. The development of postural adjustments during reaching in a sitting position turned out to have a non-linear and protracted course, which is not finished by the age of 11 years. The development of these adjustments is characterised by variation, yet specific developmental sequences could be distinguished. Firstly, the development of postural adjustments during reaching from the age of 2 years onwards lacked a preference for an en bloc strategy, which consists of an in concert activation of the direction-specific neck and trunk muscles. Secondly, anticipatory postural muscle activity, which was consistently present in adults, was virtually absent between 2 and 11 years of age. Thirdly, the data demonstrated that with increasing age the head gradually becomes the dominant frame of reference. In addition, the study suggested that, in terms of postural control, the forward-tilted position is the most efficient one."

  "title": "Attenuation of human neck muscle activity following repeated imposed trunk-forward linear acceleration",
  "date": "2003 Jun",
  "abstract": "It has been suggested that, after a passive linear acceleration of a seated subject which resembles a small, rear-end car impact, sensory information from proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual systems elicit stabilizing neck muscular responses. These neck muscular responses are presumably reflex based and are modified with the magnitude of the perturbation. A key issue that remains is to determine whether the neck and head postural responses can be modulated by a previous experience of the acceleration and not only by the magnitude of the acceleration. This question is of interest because, contrary to cadaver studies, one could expect that humans apprehending a rapid trunk acceleration would adopt a bracing behavior to minimize head movements. The aim of the present experiment was to verify whether neck-muscle activities can be modulated when prior knowledge about whole-body acceleration onset, direction, and magnitude are unknown compared with when only acceleration onset is unknown. Nine seated subjects were submitted to 11 imposed, forward linear accelerations (1.1 g). For the first trial, subjects were completely unaware of the platform acceleration characteristics (onset, direction, amplitude, and acceleration magnitude). For the subsequent ten trials, subjects knew they would be submitted to a forward linear acceleration, but the onset of the acceleration was unknown. Head kinematics and EMG responses of the neck muscles to the first perturbation were similar for all subjects (6.2 degrees head extension, EMG activity starting from 55 to 72 ms after platform onset). Following the first trial, however, all subjects showed a decreased neck EMG activity. Moreover, subjects responded in one of two ways across trials: one group of subjects ( n=5) maintained a constant head angular position and velocity, whereas the other group ( n=4) showed an increased head angular position (up to 12.6 degrees ) and velocity. This suggests that the first perturbation trial revealed a completely reactive response. After this initial trial, the responses observed may present a mixture of feedforward and feedback control. It is likely that whiplash injuries occur under conditions resembling those observed for the first trial only. If this is the case, the behavior for the following trials cannot be representative of injury mechanisms occurring in whiplash-like motion. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that, following repeated trunk linear accelerations of a constant magnitude, the nervous system prefers to minimize muscle stress instead of adopting a bracing strategy."

  "title": "Human vestibular memory studied via measurement of the subjective horizontal during gondola centrifugation",
  "date": "2003 Jul",
  "abstract": "Measurements of the subjective visual horizontal (SVH) were made in a large swing-out gondola centrifuge. Rotation of the centrifuge was anti-clockwise, as seen from above. Test subjects were seated upright in the gondola, facing forwards. In front of the subject, at a straight-ahead eye-level position, there was a narrow luminous line, which could be rotated, by remote control, about the visual axis. At gravitoinertial force levels of 1.1-1.3G the subjects were asked to indicate, by repeatedly setting the line in darkness, what they perceived as horizontal (the SVH). During gondola centrifugation, the head and body length axis is always parallel with the resultant gravitoinertial force vector (vectorial sum of earth gravity force and the centrifugal force) i.e., the horizontal plane of the head or body does not change with respect to the gravitoinertial horizontal. Hence, the otolith organs, as well as the somatosensory system, continually signal upright position. However, the swing-out of the gondola during acceleration of the centrifuge (25 degrees at 1.1G) is a roll (frontal plane) change-in-position stimulus to the vertical semicircular canals, thus creating an otolith-semicircular canal conflict. After acceleration of the centrifuge, the SVH was initially tilted up to 20 degrees to the right relative to the gravitoinertial horizontal. Since there was no roll-tilt stimulus to gravity receptors, this SVH tilt must be related to stimulation of the semicircular canals. However, it decayed much more slowly than any known effects of angular-velocity stimulation of the semicircular canals. The decay was bi-phasic with two time constants, the smaller in the region of 1-2 min, the other being too large to be reliably estimated on the basis of data collected during only 10 min. This persistence of the SVH tilt suggests a memory for angular changes in roll head position detected by the semicircular canals-a position-storage mechanism. Further, the SVH seems to be dependent on two different mechanisms related to semicircular canal stimulation."

  "abstract": "To establish the relationship between the condition of the stomatognathic system and body posture, changes in the head position during clenching were observed and investigated when the occlusal supporting zone was lost unilaterally and bilaterally. The results were as follows: 1. Regardless of the occlusal conditions, the head position was changed by clenching; 2. The occlusal conditions did not affect the changed distance of the head position; 3. The head position was changed forward and down by clenching regardless of the condition of the occlusal supporting zone. The head position changed more laterally to the opposite side of the lost occlusal supporting zone by clenching with the occlusal supporting zone lost unilaterally rather than bilaterally. Based on this study, it is suggested that unilateral loss of the occlusal supporting zone may cause the neck muscles to become inharmonious and thus affect body posture."

S1 and S2 showed a greater head-forward position than T (differences between the mean values, S1: 6.5 degrees, P=.008; S2: 6.3 degrees, P=.013).

  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the movement patterns and the muscular demand during a posterior transfer maneuver on a level surface in individuals with spinal cord injuries.\nDesign: Six participants with high-level spinal cord injury (C7 to T6) were compared to five participants with low-level spinal cord injury (T11 to L2) with partial or complete control of abdominal musculature.\nBackground: Developing an optimal level of independence for transfer activities figures among the rehabilitation goals of individuals with spinal cord injury. There has been no biomechanical study which specifically describes the posterior transfer maneuver.\nMethods: Tridimensional kinematics at the elbow, shoulder, head and trunk, as well as surface electromyographic data of the biceps, triceps, anterior deltoid, posterior deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, trapezius and rectus abdominus muscles were recorded during the posterior transfer. To quantify the muscular demand, the electromyographic data were amplitude normalized to the peak value obtained from maximum voluntary contractions. The transfer was divided into pre-lift, lift, and post-lift phases for analysis.\nResults: The duration of the lift phase was significantly shorter (P<0.05) for the high-level spinal cord injury (1.24; SD, 0.37 s) when compared to the low-level spinal cord injury (1.74; SD, 0.39 s). The patterns and magnitudes of the angular displacements were found similar between groups (P values: 0.45-0.98). However, the high-level spinal cord injury initiated the task from a forward flexed posture, whereas the low-level spinal cord injury adopted an almost upright alignment of the trunk. Higher muscular demands were calculated for all muscles among high-level spinal cord injury participants during the transfer when compared to the low-level spinal cord injury. However, only the anterior deltoid (high level=92.4%; low level=34.2%) and the pectoralis major (high level=109.8%; low level=25.6%) reached statistical significance during the lift phase.Conclusions. Participants with high-level spinal cord injury presented different movement characteristics and higher muscular demands during the posterior transfer than low-level spinal cord injury ones. This is probably to compensate for the additional trunk and upper limb musculature impairment.\nRelevance: The findings of this study may help to develop guidelines of specific strengthening programs for the thoracohumeral, scapulothoracic and shoulder muscles designed to restore optimal transfer capacity in individuals with spinal cord injury. Furthermore, innovative rehabilitation programs targeting the ability to control the trunk could be beneficial for these individuals."

  "abstract": "Study design: Human subjects were exposed experimentally to a single whiplash-like perturbation.\nObjective: To determine how awareness of the presence and timing of a whiplash-like perturbation affects the onset and amplitude of the neck muscle response and the peak magnitude of head and neck kinematics.\nSummary of background data: Although most whiplash injuries are sustained in rear-end collisions, which occur without warning, most studies of whiplash injury have used subjects aware of the imminent perturbation.\nMethods: Seated subjects (35 women and 31 men) underwent a single forward horizontal perturbation (peak acceleration, 1.5 g). Surface electromyography measured the sternocleidomastoid and cervical paraspinal muscle activity. Three awareness conditions were tested: a countdown for subjects alerted to their perturbation, a perturbation without an alert for subjects who expected it within 60 seconds, and an unexpected perturbation for surprised subjects who were deceived.\nResults: The muscle and kinematic responses of aware (alerted and unalerted) subjects were not significantly different. Sternocleidomastoid activation occurred 7 ms later in surprised subjects than in aware subjects (P < 0.0002). Cervical paraspinal amplitudes were 260% larger and angular head accelerations in flexion were 180% larger in surprised male subjects than in alerted male subjects. Surprised female subjects exhibited a 25% larger head retraction and a 30% lower forward acceleration of the mastoid process than aware female subjects.\nConclusions: The larger retractions observed in surprised females likely produce larger tissue strains and may increase injury potential. Aware human subjects may not replicate the muscle response, kinematic response, or whiplash injury potential of unprepared occupants in real collisions."

  "date": "2003 Spring",
  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of Pettibon spinal manipulation and anterior headweighting for correct cervical hypolordosis and forward head posture, quantified by measurements taken from pre and post intervention lateral cervical radiographs.\nMethods: A total of 15 subjects were selected for investigation at random. An initial seated lateral cervical radiograph was taken to evaluate forward head posture and the amount of cervical lordosis. A series of 3 manipulative procedures were performed, followed immediately by introduction of an anterior headweight device. This headweight device was worn for 5 minutes while walking on a treadmill. A post intervention seated lateral cervical radiograph was taken while each subject wore the headweight. Measurements of cervical lordosis and forward head posture were again quantified and compared to the initial radiographs.\nResults: The average overall decrease in forward head posture among all subjects was 0.83 inches. The largest reduction in forward head posture was 1.25 inches. One subject failed to show any reduction. The largest and smallest improvements in the cervical lordosis were 23 degrees and 4 degrees , respectively. The average increase in cervical lordosis for all subjects was 9.9 degrees .\nConclusions: This specific protocol was able to provide measurable improvement in cervical lordosis and reduction of forward head posture after only 1 session. However, it is not known which component, the spinal manipulation or the anterior headweighting, made the biggest impact. This study shows the immediate effects of spinal manipulation and headweighting combined. Future research should focus on the headweighting effects over a longer period of time. Additionally, anterior headweighting alone needs to be tested to evaluate its effectiveness as a sole treatment intervention."

  "abstract": "We examined the stability and strategies used by balance impaired (vestibular hypofunction, VH: n=25; cerebellar damage, CB: n=20) patients and healthy (HE: n=52) controls during planned gait termination. Upper body strategies (during final stride and final step) were investigated using peak positive kinetic power (KP((+)): kinetic energy increasing), and peak negative kinetic power (KP((-)): kinetic energy decreasing) of the head-arms-trunk segment. Compared to HE controls (P<0.05): CB patients' medio-lateral KP((+)) and KP((-)) and were 53 and 71% higher during final stride, respectively; VH patients medio-lateral KP((+)) and KP((-)) was 78 and 57% higher during final step, respectively, and; during the final, standing stage VH patients were 32% less stable (from phase plane analysis) in the frontal plane. The excessive energy transfers in final stride for CB patients was likely due to poor eccentric muscle control when preparing for the stop. VH patients had difficulty controlling lateral stability during final step and once they had stopped walking, probably due to the lack of vestibular feedback regarding forward velocity changes. A better understanding of these abnormal movement patterns or compensatory strategies may assist in rehabilitation of patients with balance dysfunction."

  "date": "2003 Apr",
  "abstract": "Understanding reactive recovery responses to slipping is fundamental in falls research and prevention. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the unperturbed limb and arms in the reactive recovery response to an unexpected slip. Ten healthy, young adults participated in this experiment in which an unexpected slip was induced by a set of steel free-wheeling rollers. Surface electromyography (EMG) data were collected from the unperturbed limb (i.e., the swing limb) rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and the medial head of gastrocnemius, and bilateral gluteus medius, erector spinae, and deltoids. Kinematic data were also collected by an optical imaging system to monitor limb trajectories. The first slip response was significantly different from the subsequent recovery responses to the unexpected slips, with an identifiable reactive recovery response and no proactive changes in EMG patterns. The muscles of the unperturbed limb, upper body, and arms were recruited at the same latency as those previously found for the perturbed limb. The arm elevation strategies assisted in shifting the center of mass forward after it was posteriorly displaced with the slip, while the unperturbed limb musculature demonstrated an extensor strategy supporting the observed lowering of the limb to briefly touch the ground to widen the base of support and to increase stability. Evidently a dynamic multilimb coordinated strategy is employed by the CNS to control and coordinate the upper and lower limbs in reactive recovery responses to unexpected slips during locomotion."

  "date": "2003 Mar",
  "abstract": "The pitch vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is accurate and symmetrical when tested in the normal upright posture, where otolith organ and central velocity storage signals supplement the basic VOR mediated by the semicircular canals. However, when the animal and rotation axis are together repositioned by rolling 90 degrees to one side, head forward pitch rotations that excite the anterior semicircular canals elicit a more accurately timed VOR than do oppositely directed rotations that excite the posterior canals. This suggests that velocity storage of posterior canal signals is lost when the head is placed on its side. We recorded from 47 VOR relay neurons, second-order vestibulo-ocular neurons, of alert cats to test whether asymmetries are evident in the responses of neurons in the medial and superior vestibular nuclei during earth-horizontal axis rotations in the normal upright posture. Neurons were identified by antidromic responses to oculomotor nucleus stimulation and orthodromic responses to labyrinth stimulation, and were classified as having primarily anterior, posterior, or horizontal canal input based on response directionality. Neuronal response gains and phases were recorded during 0.5 Hz and 0.05 Hz sinusoidal oscillations in darkness. During 0.5 Hz rotations, anterior canal second-order vestibulo-ocular neurons responded approximately in phase with head velocity (mean phase re head position, +/- SE, 80 degrees +/- 3 degrees, n=18), as did posterior canal second-order vestibulo-ocular neurons (mean phase 81 degrees +/- 1 degree, n=25). Lowering the rotation frequency to 0.05 Hz resulted in only slight advances in response phases of individual anterior canal second-order vestibulo-ocular neurons (mean phase 86 degrees +/- 6 degrees, mean advance 7 degrees +/- 5 degrees, n=12). In contrast, posterior canal second-order vestibulo-ocular neurons behaved more like semicircular canal afferents, with responses markedly phase-advanced (mean advance 28 degrees +/- 5 degrees, n=14) by lowering rotation frequency to 0.05 Hz (mean phase 111 degrees +/- 5 degrees, n=14). In summary, low frequency responses of anterior and posterior canal second-order vestibulo-ocular neurons recorded during horizontal axis pitch correspond to the VOR they excite during vertical axis pitch. These results show that velocity storage is evident at anterior but not posterior canal second-order vestibulo-ocular neurons. We conclude that responses of posterior canal second-order vestibulo-ocular neurons are insufficient to explain the accurate low frequency VOR phase observed during backward head pitch in the upright posture, and that velocity storage or otolith signals required for VOR accuracy are carried by other neurons."

  "date": "2003 Mar",
  "abstract": "Computer simulation was used to predict the extent to which age-related muscle atrophy may adversely affect the safe arrest of a forward fall onto the arms. The biomechanical factors affecting the separate risks for wrist fracture or head impact were examined using a two-dimensional, 5-link, forward dynamic model. The hypothesis was tested in older females that age-related loss in muscular strength renders the use of the arms ineffective in arresting a forward fall without either a torso impact exceeding 0.5m/s or distal forearm loads sufficient to fracture the wrist. The results demonstrate that typical age-related decline in arm muscle strength substantially reduces the ability to arrest a forward fall without the elbows buckling and, therefore, a risk of torso and/or head impact. The model predicted that older women with below-average bone strength risk a Colles fracture when arresting typical falls, particularly with an extended arm."

  "date": "2003 Feb",
  "abstract": "While much is known about reflex and mechanical contributions to the control of head stability, little is known about predictive control. The goal of this experiment was to determine the contribution of predictive mechanisms to head stability in space, in the pitch plane, during forward trunk perturbations. Eleven standing healthy subjects had their trunk pulled forward by a load-pulley apparatus. The perturbation was either self-triggered or imposed (triggered by the experimenter). Subjects were exposed to two loads: 2% and 4% of their body weight. The contributions of torques acting on the head-neck system were inferred from head and trunk kinematics, neck muscle EMG, and the torques acting on the head, which were computed using inverse dynamics. The results showed that both the head and trunk moved less during the self-triggered than imposed condition during both loads for most of the participants. There was no evidence of predictive neck countertorque or increased neck muscle co-contraction during the self-triggered condition. These findings suggest that most of the subjects improved head stability in the self-triggered condition by reducing trunk motion and the associated interactive torque that perturbed the head."

This has led to an increase of positional plagiocephaly. The aim of this study was to describe this condition and to recommend a preventive treatment.\nMaterial and methods: This is a retrospective registration of 133 children with positional plagiocephaly seen in the period from 1994 to 2000.\nResults: The number of children with positional plagiocephaly increased from two in 1994 to a maximum of 43 in 1999. 83 were males and 50 were females. 84 were dextral and 49 were sinistral. In seven (14%) of the sinistral and three (4%) of the dextral, we found a physical explanation of the head turning. In 51 children, X-rays of the skull were performed, but no synostosis was found.\nDiscussion: The back-sleeping position of infants is a promotive factor to positional plagiocephaly which may be prevented by simple alternating head positioning. Otherwise early (< 6 months of age) corrective physiotherapy and positioning or an orthoplastic helmet must be considered. The diagnosis of positional plagiocephaly is based on clinical observations. There is a favourite head turning, an ipsilateral occipital flattening, an ipsilateral frontal bossing, and the ipsilateral ear is moved forward."

  "title": "Vestibular actions on back and lower limb muscles during postural tasks in man",
  "date": "2003 Jan 15",
  "abstract": "The vestibular system was activated by galvanic electrical stimulation in 19 normal subjects. With the head turned to one side so that the stimulating anode was on the posterior mastoid process, stimulation caused standing subjects to sway backwards in the sagittal plane. Electromyography showed bilateral activation of erector spinae, gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, soleus and intrinsic foot (toe flexor) muscles. When head direction or electrode polarity was reversed so that the anode was anterior, all those muscles became less active and the subjects swayed forwards. With the head facing forward, stimulation caused sideways sway in the coronal plane, towards the anode, with excitation of the erector spinae on the anode side and reduced activity on the cathode side. The limb muscles were activated on the side opposite the anode and showed complex responses on the anode side. Responses were detectable in the erectores spinae muscles in sitting subjects. No responses in limb muscles were detected in the sitting posture. Subject responses in erector spinae recorded at L3/L4 had latencies from 59 to 110 ms, using a 2 mA stimulus. Latencies in lower limb muscles were longer. The results suggest a role for the vestibular system and descending brain stem motor pathways to the erectores spinae muscles in the control of postural orientation of the back when sitting and standing. The conduction velocity in the motor pathway was estimated to be 13 +/- 10 m s(-1) (mean +/- S.D., n = 12 subjects)."

  "date": "2002 Oct",
  "abstract": "Many practitioners will recognize that subjects with a large mandibular plane inclination are characterized by an extended head posture and a forward inclined cervical column, i.e. an extended cranio-cervical posture. It is also typical that subjects with a short-face morphology often carry their heads somewhat lowered, and have a markedly backward-curved upper cervical spine, i.e. cervical lordosis. The aim of the paper is to link together the findings of a series of studies that attempt to clarify this relationship, and bring into focus cranio-cervical posture, which is a functional factor that seems to be involved in many clinical orthodontic problems. To provide a background for the article, the concept of standardized posture of the head and the cervical column is developed, and procedures for recording this posture, as well as categories of cephalometric variables that express the different postural relationships, are described. Findings that relate cranio-cervical posture to upper airway obstruction, to craniofacial morphology, and to malocclusion are surveyed, and a post-natal developmental mechanism that explains the findings and leads to further questions is discussed. Recent findings of a relationship between extended cranio-cervical posture and signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders further emphasize the biological importance of this functional parameter."

  "date": "2002 Oct",
  "abstract": "Self-motion detection requires the interaction of a number of sensory systems for correct perceptual interpretation of a given movement and an eventual motor response. Parietal cortical areas are thought to play an important role in this function, and we have thus studied the encoding of multimodal signals and their spatiotemporal interactions in the ventral intraparietal area of macaque monkeys. Thereby, we have identified for the first time the presence of vestibular sensory input to this area and described its interaction with somatosensory and visual signals, via extracellular single-cell recordings in awake head-fixed animals. Visual responses were driven by large field stimuli that simulated either backward or forward self-motion (contraction or expansion stimuli, respectively), or movement in the frontoparallel plane (visual increments moving simultaneously in the same direction). While the dominant sensory modality in most neurons was visual, about one third of all recorded neurons responded to horizontal rotation. These vestibular responses were typically in phase with head velocity, but in some cases they could signal acceleration or even showed integration to position. The associated visual responses were always codirectional with the vestibular on-direction, i.e. noncomplementary. Somatosensory responses were in register with the visual preferred direction, either in the same or in the opposite direction, thus signalling translation or rotation in the horizontal plane. These results, taken together with data on responses to optic flow stimuli obtained in a parallel study, strongly suggest an involvement of area VIP in the analysis and the encoding of self-motion."

  "date": "2002 Oct",
  "abstract": "Objectives: To show that so-called compensatory ocular countertorsion (static ocular counterrolling) does not exist and to describe the torsional eye movements that occur while the head is tilting.\nMethods: Two miniature video cameras, a fiberoptic light source, and a fixation target were suspended from a headband. The cameras, fixation target, and light source moved in synchrony with the head. One camera videorecorded iris and conjunctival landmarks, and the other recorded head movement and position. The video frames were digitized and analyzed using computer algorithms.\nResults: The eyes showed no compensatory ocular countertorsion in any stabilized head tilt position. During head tilt, periodic torsional eye movements occurred. These movements included a tonic counterlag followed by a saccadic forward torsion that rotated the eyes prior to the head; this was followed by a saccadic countertorsion that realigned and synchronized the eyes with the head, bringing the eyes and head into equilibrium.\nConclusions: Compensatory ocular countertorsion does not exist. Torsion occurs only during head tilt. The eyes are oriented to the brain and not to the horizon. When the head stabilizes in any tilted position, the retinas assume the same dynamic state of equilibrium with the brain that they assume in every other position. The main function of the oblique muscles is to stabilize the retinas in relation to the brain in all held head positions and directions of gaze. During head tilt, the oblique muscles produce involuntary torsional movements of small amplitude (up to approximately 10 degrees ) that appear to anticipate the final head position and prepare the eyes for obtaining retinal correspondence. These torsional movements may protect the retinas by dampening the effect of the head movement on this sensitive tissue."

  "date": "2002 Oct",
  "abstract": "We report neck muscle activity and head movements evoked by electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus (SC) in head-unrestrained monkeys. Recording neck electromyography (EMG) circumvents complications arising from the head's inertia and the kinetics of muscle force generation and allows precise assessment of the neuromuscular drive to the head plant. This study served two main purposes. First, we sought to test the predictions made in the companion paper of a parallel drive from the SC onto neck muscles. Low-current, long-duration stimulation evoked both neck EMG responses and head movements either without or prior to gaze shifts, testifying to a SC drive to neck muscles that is independent of gaze-shift initiation. However, gaze-shift initiation was linked to a transient additional EMG response and head acceleration, confirming the presence of a SC drive to neck muscles that is dependent on gaze-shift initiation. We forward a conceptual neural architecture and suggest that this parallel drive provides the oculomotor system with the flexibility to orient the eyes and head independently or together, depending on the behavioral context. Second, we compared the EMG responses evoked by SC stimulation to those that accompanied volitional head movements. We found characteristic features in the underlying pattern of evoked neck EMG that were not observed during volitional head movements in spite of the seemingly natural kinematics of evoked head movements. These features included reciprocal patterning of EMG activity on the agonist and antagonist muscles during stimulation, a poststimulation increase in the activity of antagonist muscles, and synchronously evoked responses on agonist and antagonist muscles regardless of initial horizontal head position. These results demonstrate that the electrically evoked SC drive to the head cannot be considered as a neural replicate of the SC drive during volitional head movements and place important new constraints on the interpretation of electrically evoked head movements."

  "abstract": "We measured tracheal flow from tracheal sounds to estimate tidal volume, minute ventilation (VI), respiratory frequency, mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI), and duty cycle (TI/Ttot). In 11 normal subjects, 3 patients with unstable airway obstruction, and 3 stable asthmatic patients, we measured tracheal sounds and flow twice: first to derive flow-sound relationships and second to obtain flow-volume relationships from the sound signal. The flow-volume relationship was compared with pneumotach-derived volume. When subjects were seated, facing forward and with neck rotation, flexion, and standing, flow-volume relationship was within 15% of pneumotach-derived volume. Error increased with neck extension and while supine. We then measured ventilation without mouthpiece or nose clip from tracheal sounds during quiet breathing for up to 30 min. Normal results +/- SD revealed tidal volume = 0.37 +/- 0.065 liter, respiratory frequency = 19.3 +/- 3.5 breaths/min, VI = 6.9 +/- 1.2 l/min, VT/TI = 0.31 +/- 0.06 l/s, and TI/Ttot = 0.37 +/- 0.04. Unstable airway obstruction had large VI due to increased VT/TI. With the exception of TI/Ttot, variations in ventilatory parameters were closer to log normal than normal distributions and tended to be greater in patients. We conclude that phonospirometry measures ventilation reasonably accurately without mouthpiece, nose clip, or rigid postural constraints."

  "date": "2002 Jun",
  "abstract": "Evidence is presented for a clinical classification of central vestibular syndromes according to the three major planes of action of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR): yaw, pitch, and roll. The plane-specific vestibular syndromes are determined by ocular motor, postural, and perceptual signs. Yaw plane signs are horizontal nystagmus, horizontal past pointing, rotational and lateral body falls to the right or to the left, and horizontal deviation of perceived straight-ahead. Pitch plane signs are upbeat/downbeat nystagmus, forward/backward tilts and falls, and upward or downward deviations of the perceived horizontal. Roll plane signs are torsional nystagmus, skew deviation, ocular torsion, tilts of head, body, and perceived subjective visual vertical. The VOR syndromes defined in this way allow a precise topographic analysis of brainstem lesions according to their level and side. The lesional sites of yaw syndromes are restricted to the pontomedullary level (vestibular nucleus). A tone imbalance in pitch indicates bilateral (paramedian) lesions of the medullary or pontomesencephalic brainstem or bilateral dysfunction of the flocculus. A tone imbalance in roll indicates unilateral lesions, ipsiversive at the pontomedullary level (vestibular nuclei) and contraversive at the pontomesencephalic level (MLF and INC). A unilateral lesion (or stimulation) of the graviceptive pathways, which transduce input from vertical semicircular canals and otolith, affects function in roll, whereas bilateral lesions affect function in pitch."

  "date": "2002",
  "abstract": "This study considers the subjective evaluation of ride quality during ambulance transportation using an actively-controlled stretcher (ACS). The ride quality of a conventional stretcher and an assistant driver's seat is also compared. Braking during ambulance transportation generates negative foot-to-head acceleration in patients and causes blood pressure to rise in the patient's head. The ACS absorbs the foot-to-head acceleration by changing the angle of the stretcher, thus reducing the blood pressure variation. However, the ride quality of the ACS should be investigated further because the movement of the ACS may cause motion sickness and nausea. Experiments of ambulance transportation, including rapid acceleration and deceleration, are performed to evaluate the effect of differences in posture of the transported subject on the ride quality; the semantic differential method and factor analysis are used in the investigations. Subjects are transported using a conventional stretcher with head forward, a conventional stretcher with head backward, the ACS, and an assistant driver's seat for comparison with transportation using a stretcher. Experimental results show that the ACS gives the most comfortable transportation when using a stretcher. Moreover, the reduction of the negative foot-to-head acceleration at frequencies below 0.2 Hz and the small variation of the foot-to-head acceleration result in more comfortable transportation. Conventional transportation with the head forward causes the worst transportation, although the characteristics of the vibration of the conventional stretcher seem to be superior to that of the ACS."

  "abstract": "The biomechanical influences of head posture on the cervical column and craniofacial complex during masticatory simulation were quantified using three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA). Three types of finite element model (FEM) were designed to examine relationships between the position of the head and malocclusion. Model A was constructed to have a standardized cervical column curve, model B a forward inclined posture, and model C a backward inclined posture. The results of the spinal displacements revealed that model B moved in a forward direction and model C in a backward direction during masticatory simulation. The stress distributions on the cervical column (C1-C7) for models A, B, and C showed differences; stress converged at the atlas in model A, high-level stresses were observed at the spinous processes of C6 and C7 in model C, and the stress converged at the anterior edge in the vertebral body of C4 of model B. Stress distribution on the occlusal plane and maxillofacial structure did not show absolute differences among the three models. Alteration of head posture was directly related to stress distribution on the cervical column, but may not always directly influence the occlusal state."

  "date": "2002 Sep",
  "abstract": "In order to investigate the ways in which sensory channels interact to control balance, we measured the postural response evoked by galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in a rare subject (I. W.) with a large-fibre sensory neuronopathy. I. W. has no sensations of cutaneous light touch and movement/position sense below the neck, and without vision he has no knowledge of where his limbs and body are in space. He was tested with and without vision while seated. With eyes closed, I. W.'s responses to pure vestibular stimuli were an order of magnitude larger than those of healthy controls. In other respects his responses were normal. Part of this phenomenon may have been due to lack of response modification by somatosensory feedback. However, the initial development of his ground reaction force, which is the earliest mechanical indicator of the response, differed from that of a control subject from its beginning. Similarly, opening his eyes resulted in a reduction (>50%) of the response from its beginning. We propose that these early changes reflect changes in initial response selection, possibly by alterations in the gain of vestibulopostural channels. We suggest that similar gain changes operate in healthy subjects and occur through a fast dynamic process. A model is put forward in which the weight of each sensory channel is adjusted continuously in a competitive manner according to the balance-relevant information content of the other sensory channels. As a secondary issue, the nature of I. W.'s head and trunk tilt response provides insight into the question of which vestibular afferents are recruited by GVS. I. W.'s responses consisted of an initial, relatively fast tilt followed by a slower, continuous tilt. When the stimulus was turned off, his body partially tilted back at an intermediate velocity. We modelled this behaviour as the algebraic sum of a position response and a constant velocity response. We suggest that these two components arise from stimulation of otolith and semicircular canal afferents, respectively."

  "title": "Jumping in a winged stick insect",
  "date": "2002 Aug",
  "abstract": "The Thailand winged stick insect (Sipyloidea sp.) flees rapidly from a disturbance by jumping forwards when stimulated on the abdomen and backwards when stimulated on the head. The mechanisms underlying these fast movements were analysed by measuring movements of the body and legs from images captured at 250 Hz. A forward jump of both adults and nymphs involves movements of the abdomen and the middle and hind pairs of legs. The abdomen is raised and swung forwards by flexion at the joint with the metathorax and at the joint between the meso- and metathorax. At the same time, the tibiae of the hind and middle legs are extended and their femora depressed. The femoro-tibial joints of the legs are not fully flexed before a jump, and no structures in these joints appear to store muscular energy. The whole jumping sequence takes approximately 100 ms and results in take-off angles of 10-35 degrees at velocities of 0.6-0.8 m s(-1) and with an acceleration of 10 m s(-2). The abdominal angular velocity was 2000 degrees s(-1) and the tip of the abdomen moved at linear velocities of some 1 m s(-1), while the maximum rate of tibial extension was 4000 degrees s(-1). Rapid backward movements result either in the collapse of the body onto the ground, with a displacement away from the stimulus of approximately half a body length, or in the propulsion of the insect off its perch. Neither movement involves curling of the abdomen. From a horizontal posture, the forward jumps result in a displacement of a few body lengths. More lift can be generated in adults by elevating the hind wings as the abdomen is swung forwards and depressing them as the legs lose contact with the ground. In this way, jumps can lead directly to flapping flight. Take-off into flight can, however, be achieved without the abdominal movements seen during jumping. From a vertical posture, a forward jump propels the insect upwards and backwards before it falls to the ground horizontally displaced from its perch. Backward movements result in the insect falling with little horizontal displacement from its perch."

  "abstract": "Objective: To demonstrate the benefits of reducing forward head posture and restoring the cervical lordosis as a novel approach to treating a patient with mechanical thoracic pain.\nClinical features: The patient had thoracolumbar junction pain bilaterally that failed to respond to previous sessions of spinal manipulative therapy. Treatment included both manipulative and rehabilitative procedures designed to correct the forward head posture and cervical kyphosis. Treatment progress was quantified on pre and post lateral cervical radio-graphs.\nIntervention and outcome: The treatment plan was 30 sessions over an 8-week period that included spinal manipulative therapy, used in concert with a new headweight device applied immediately after the manipulation was performed at each session. The patient was also instructed on the performance of certain rehabilitative procedures to be performed in the home setting. The patient experienced significant symptomatic relief after the 3rd week of care. The cervical lordosis was restored by 144% and the forward head posture was decreased by 56% at the end of the trial period.\nConclusion: Restoration of the cervical curve and reduction of forward head posture appears to have beneficial effects beyond the cervical spine. The addition of active rehabilitative procedures seems to enhance the effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy in the correction of forward head posture and cervical kyphosis."

  "title": "Influence of laptop computer design and working position on physical exposure variables",
  "date": "2002 Jun",
  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the impact of two laptop designs (with or without palm rest) and two work situations (on desk or lap) on neck and upper limb posture, muscle activity and productivity.\nDesign and methods: Eight healthy subjects performed a standardized typing task of 15 min duration. During the last 5 min of each test, the neck, upper arm and trunk postures were captured by a three-dimensional video system, wrist motion was measured by a biaxial electrogoniometer and muscle activity of four neck and upper limb muscles was recorded.\nResults: Only minor differences in postures, wrist positions and productivity were observed when comparing the two laptop designs in the same situation. Larger differences were found when comparing the two situations (desk or lap). In the desk situation, the subjects bent their heads forward less, had less backward trunk inclination and wrist extension, but more elevation of the upper arm. Higher electromyographic (EMG) levels in the trapezius and deltoid muscles and lower EMG levels in the wrist extensors were also found in the desk situation.\nConclusions: Our findings do not favor one particular laptop design because only small differences in physical exposure were found. However, the workstation set up influenced the physical exposure variables, and was pinpointed as the main determinant to be considered when doing laptop work even-though no ideal situation was found. Greater physical (muscular and articular) constraints seem to be imposed to the shoulder region in the desk situation whereas the head-neck and wrist segments appear to be more stressed in the lap situation.\nRelevance: Laptop computers are often used although the physical exposure in laptop work and the impact of different laptop designs have not been systematically assessed. A better understanding of these factors may help formulate some recommendations for laptop users."

  "title": "A study on the prevalence of and risk factors for neck pain among university academic staff in Hong Kong",
  "date": "2002 Jun",
  "abstract": "The 1-year prevalence of neck pain and possible risk factors among university academic staff were investigated. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to all the full-time academic staff in one of the universities in Hong Kong. The 1-year prevalence of neck pain was investigated. The relationship between individual factors, job nature, psychosocial factors, and neck pain were also analyzed. The 1-year prevalence of neck pain among after being an academic staff was 46.7%. A significant association was found between gender and neck pain (p = 0.02). The percentage of female academic staff with neck pain (62%) was higher than that in male staff (38%). This matched the results of other studies, which demonstrated that neck pain was more prevalent in women. There was a significant association between head posture during computer processing and neck pain (p = 0.02). Among those with neck pain during computer processing, 60.5% had a forward head posture. However, a low correlation between psychosocial factors and neck pain was demonstrated (r = 0.343). Academic staff in tertiary institutions could be considered as a high-risk group of job-related neck pain."

  "title": "Estimated natural head position and facial morphology",
  "date": "2002 Apr",
  "abstract": "Estimated natural head position, or natural head orientation (NHO), has been proposed as a preferred reference position for assessing facial morphology. However, because this position is subjectively defined by the orthodontist, it could be influenced by facial form, which would be an undesirable attribute. The aim of this study was to assess whether NHO is influenced by facial morphology. Lateral photographs of 14 patients were used. Each was warped to produce 2 new images, with the chin positioned backwards or forwards relative to the original (+/-2 degrees change of the soft tissue N-Pg line). All 42 images were placed in circular frames and shown to 7 experienced orthodontists, who were asked to orient them to NHO. Image orientation between the 3 chin positions was measured and compared. The results showed that NHO depended on chin position. Images with protrusive chins were positioned with the head rotated more downwards (Frankfort plane 3.10 degrees relative to horizontal) than were images with retrusive chins (Frankfort plane 4.98 degrees ). The difference in head orientation measurements was half of the difference in chin position (1.88 degrees for a chin change of 4 degrees ). These findings call into question the validity of NHO for diagnosis because it depends on the same factor it aims to assess. Use of NHO would result in underestimating the true skeletal relationships."

  "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the features of BP, HR, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and heart rate variation (HRV) during sequential head-up tilt table test (HUT) and provide information for methodology of testing tendency to syncope in pilots.\nMethod: Sixteen healthy male were exposed to HUT +45 degrees 20 min, +60 degrees 20 min, and +75 degrees 20 min respectively with 5 min rests in between. CBFV, HR, HRV, BP were measured with transcranial doppler image (TCI), 12-Lead in phase ECG.\nResult: 1) As the tilt angle became larger, HR and DBP increased gradually (P<0.05), with SBP, PP and CBF Velocity (Vs,Vm,Vd) descended. There were significant differences among the various conditions. CV became smaller before +75 degrees, and then it began to increase. 2) Correlation between physiological indices and techno-indices were analyzed. At the point of 1 min, tilt angle was significantly positively correlated with SBP, DBP, MAP, Vd, and sdRR (P<0.01); At the point of 20 min, tilt angle was significantly positively correlated with HR and sdRR (P<0.01), but negatively correlated with SBP, PP, Vs and mRR (P<0.01), time of exposure was positively correlated with HP (P< 0.01), but negatively correlated with Vm, Vd, and mRR (P<0.01). 3) Correlation among physiological indices were also analyzed. HR were negatively correlated with SBP, Vs, Vm and Vd (P<0.01), SBP were significantly positively correlated with Vd, and mRR (P<0.01). Vs, Vm, Vd were significantly positively correlated with mRR and sdRR (P< 0.01).\nConclusion: By investigating HR, BP, HRV and CBFV during of different angles, some advises for evaluating the tendency to syncope in pilots were put forward."

  "title": "Adolescent standing postural response to backpack loads: a randomised controlled experimental study",
  "date": "2002 Apr 17",
  "abstract": "Background: Backpack loads produce changes in standing posture when compared with unloaded posture. Although 'poor' unloaded standing posture has been related to spinal pain, there is little evidence of whether, and how much, exposure to posterior load produces injurious effects on spinal tissue. The objective of this study was to describe the effect on adolescent sagittal plane standing posture of different loads and positions of a common design of school backpack. The underlying study aim was to test the appropriateness of two adult 'rules-of-thumb'-that for postural efficiency, backpacks should be worn high on the spine, and loads should be limited to 10% of body weight.\nMethod: A randomised controlled experimental study was conducted on 250 adolescents (12-18 years), randomly selected from five South Australian metropolitan high schools. Sagittal view anatomical points were marked on head, neck, shoulder, hip, thigh, knee and ankle. There were nine experimental conditions: combinations of backpack loads (3, 5 or 10% of body weight) and positions (backpack centred at T7, T12 or L3). Sagittal plane photographs were taken of unloaded standing posture (baseline), and standing posture under the experimental conditions. Posture was quantified from the x (horizontal) coordinate of each anatomical point under each experimental condition. Differences in postural response were described, and differences between conditions were determined using Analysis of Variance models.\nResults: Neither age nor gender was a significant factor when comparing postural response to backpack loads or conditions. Backpacks positioned at T7 produced the largest forward (horizontal) displacement at all the anatomical points. The horizontal position of all anatomical points increased linearly with load.\nConclusion: There is evidence refuting the 'rule-of-thumb' to carry the backpack high on the back. Typical school backpacks should be positioned with the centre at waist or hip level. There is no evidence for the 10% body weight limit."

  "title": "Ontogenetic study of the skull in modern humans and the common chimpanzees: neotenic hypothesis reconsidered with a tridimensional Procrustes analysis",
  "date": "2002 May",
  "abstract": "Heterochronic studies compare ontogenetic trajectories of an organ in different species: here, the skulls of common chimpanzees and modern humans. A growth trajectory requires three parameters: size, shape, and ontogenetic age. One of the great advantages of the Procrustes method is the precise definition of size and shape for whole organs such as the skull. The estimated ontogenetic age (dental stages) is added to the plot to give a graphical representation to compare growth trajectories. We used the skulls of 41 Homo sapiens and 50 Pan troglodytes at various stages of growth. The Procrustes superimposition of all specimens was completed by statistical procedures (principal component analysis, multivariate regression, and discriminant function) to calculate separately size-related shape changes (allometry common to chimpanzees and humans), and interspecific shape differences (discriminant function). The results confirm the neotenic theory of the human skull (sensu Gould [1977] Ontogeny and Phylogeny, Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Alberch et al. [1979] Paleobiology 5:296-317), but modify it slightly. Human growth is clearly retarded in terms of both the magnitude of changes (size-shape covariation) and shape alone (size-shape dissociation) with respect to the chimpanzees. At the end of growth, the adult skull in humans reaches an allometric shape (size-related shape) which is equivalent to that of juvenile chimpanzees with no permanent teeth, and a size which is equivalent to that of adult chimpanzees. Our results show that human neoteny involves not only shape retardation (paedomorphosis), but also changes in relative growth velocity. Before the eruption of the first molar, human growth is accelerated, and then strongly decelerated, relative to the growth of the chimpanzee as a reference. This entails a complex process, which explains why these species reach the same overall (i.e., brain + face) size in adult stage. The neotenic traits seem to concern primarily the function of encephalization, but less so other parts of the skull. Our results, based on the discriminant function, reveal that additional structural traits (corresponding to the nonallometric part of the shape which is specific to humans) are rather situated in the other part of the skull. They mainly concern the equilibrium of the head related to bipedalism, and the respiratory and masticatory functions. Thus, the reduced prognathism, the flexed cranial base (forward position of the foramen magnum which is brought closer to the palate), the reduced anterior portion of the face, the reduced glabella, and the prominent nose mainly correspond to functional innovations which have nothing to do with a neotenic process in human evolution. The statistical analysis used here gives us the possibility to point out that some traits, which have been classically described as paedomorphic because they superficially resemble juvenile traits, are in reality independent of growth."

  "title": "Vestibular control of sympathetic activity. An otolith-sympathetic reflex in humans",
  "date": "2002 Apr",
  "abstract": "It has been proposed that a vestibular reflex originating in the otolith organs and other body graviceptors modulates sympathetic activity during changes in posture with regard to gravity. To test this hypothesis, we selectively stimulated otolith and body graviceptors sinusoidally along different head axes in the coronal plane with off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) and recorded sympathetic efferent activity in the peroneal nerve (muscle sympathetic nerve activity, MSNA), blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. All parameters were entrained during OVAR at the frequency of rotation, with MSNA increasing in nose-up positions during forward linear acceleration and decreasing when nose-down. MSNA was correlated closely with blood pressure when subjects were within +/-90 degrees of nose-down positions with a delay of 1.4 s, the normal latency of baroreflex-driven changes in MSNA. Thus, in the nose-down position, MSNA was probably driven by baroreflex afferents. In contrast, when subjects were within +/-45 degrees of the nose-up position, i.e., when positive linear acceleration was maximal along the naso-ocipital axis, MSNA was closely related to gravitational acceleration at a latency of 0.4 s. This delay is too short for MSNA changes to be mediated by the baroreflex, but it is compatible with the delay of a response originating in the vestibular system. We postulate that a vestibulosympathetic reflex, probably originating mainly in the otolith organs, contributes to blood pressure maintenance during forward linear acceleration. Because of its short latency, this reflex may be one of the earliest mechanisms to sustain blood pressure upon standing."

  "title": "Vestibular contributions across the execution of a voluntary forward step",
  "date": "2002 Mar",
  "abstract": "This work addressed the influence of information arising from the vestibular system on the dynamic control of a forward step. Six subjects performed the stepping task with their eyes closed under three conditions of bipolar, binaural galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), including (1) no GVS, (2) GVS with the anode electrode on the side of the swing limb, and (3) GVS with the anode electrode on the side of the stance limb. GVS was delivered 1,500 ms prior to a cue to step. Ground reaction forces were collected from three force platforms and movement was recorded from IRED markers placed bilaterally on the body. The results showed that, following slight deviations caused by GVS onset, the step initiation behaviour was unaffected, but lateral deviations were found during the latter, more dynamic, phases of stepping for centre of mass trajectories, time integrals of the centre of pressure displacement and upper body roll. These findings showed that vestibular information is used differently across the execution of a step without vision. While the initiation phase is run in a feedforward manner without vestibular influence, vestibular information appears to be upregulated during the more dynamic phases. Also, the level of up-regulation may be different across step execution."

This study assesses which of three head positions commonly used to instil nose drops resulted in the highest coverage of this area. Discomfort levels were also studied using a visual analogue scale for each position. Five volunteers were studied in: (i) head back (HB); (ii) head forward and down (HFD); and (iii) lying head back (LHB) positions. Betamethasone nose drops, dyed with fluorescein, were instilled into each nostril and the distribution was studied endoscopically. The middle meatus area distribution was highest in the LHB position (55.51%), followed by HFD (31.55%) and HB (6.87%) positions. Comparison of distribution between HB and LHB (P = 0.002) and between HB and HFD (P = 0.045) was statistically significant. The HFD position was most uncomfortable (mean discomfort score 8.8) whereas the HB (2.4) and LHB (2.6) were similar. The LHB would, therefore, appear to be the most suitable position for instillation of steroid nose drops."

  "abstract": "This study evaluated whether changes in jaw and neck position caused substantial airway resistance (Raw) changes in normal controls and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) subjects. Subject groups included 12 male nocturnal polysomnographically diagnosed OSA patients and 16 healthy male control subjects. Raw was assessed plethysmographically and measured under the following conditions: neutral head posture with 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, or 3/3 of the subjects maximum forward jaw position; normal jaw (0/3 forward) with fully flexed, extended, right or left rotated head position. Both groups showed a similar significant decrease in Raw upon jaw protrusion. OSA patients showed a significantly higher baseline (normal jaw, neutral head posture). Raw and both subject groups also had a clear increase in their airway resistance with flexion and to a lesser extent with neck rotation and extension. These data document that airway resistance can be significantly influenced by head and jaw positioning with protrusion of the jaw reducing Raw and flexing the neck increasing Raw."

  "date": "2001 Dec",
  "abstract": "A cephalometric evaluation of the changes in the horizontal and vertical placement of the hyoid bone and of those in the position of the head over the cervical spine after surgical mandibular advancement was undertaken. Seven linear and one angular measurement were investigated in 60 patients, 17 males and 43 females, before and one year after surgical mandibular advancement. The hyoid bone moved forwards horizontally in 78 per cent of the subjects, backwards in 17 per cent, and in 5 per cent of patients it retained its pre-operative position. It moved vertically downwards in 32 per cent of subjects, and in 63 per cent it moved upwards and closer to the body of mandible. The amount of horizontal and vertical change of the hyoid bone was associated with the corresponding change of the mandible after surgery. The vertical change was more distinct in females compared with males. There was variation in the position of the head over the cervical spine; it showed extension in 26.7 per cent of the sample, flexion in 71.7 per cent, and remained the same in only 1.6 per cent after surgery. The results show that with surgical mandibular advancement the hyoid bone follows mainly the advancement of the mandible and moves closer to the body of the mandible. However, there are variations in the changes of hyoid bone and head position that are difficult to predict."

  "abstract": "A pattern of sound-induced paroxysms of the eye and head and other spinal motor neuron synkinesis (Tullio's phenomenon) in human subjects always implies either a pathological contiguity of the tympano-ossicular chain and membranous labyrinth or a dehiscence of the bone overlying the superior semicircular canal. However, it has become clear in the last decade that sound-evoked vestibular stimulation is not only a sign of disease but also a physiological phenomenon, The examination of such physiologically sound-induced vestibular (saccular) responses contributes today to the clinical testing of the vestibular organ, mainly in the form of vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials. In this study it was observed that, in a group of 20 normal subjects, a 500 Hz tonal stimulus of high intensity (105 dB HL = 118.5 dB SPL), applied monoaurally, elicited postural responses. Each subject was studied under 4 different conditions: (i) head facing forwards, eyes open; (ii) head facing forwards, eyes closed; (iii) head rotated approximately 90 degrees to the right, eyes closed: and (iv) head rotated approximately 90 degrees to the left, eyes closed. Body sway, measured using a force platform, was recorded in all subjects, with eyes either open or closed. Postural responses, which were also elicited with a 250 Hz tonal stimulus, were not observed with a tone of 2000 Hz, with legs slightly flexed or with binaural stimulation. The postural sway (head facing forwards, eyes open or closed) was in a lateral direction towards the stimulated ear: with the stimulus applied to the right ear the subject had postural sway towards the right, with the stimulus applied to the left ear towards the left. When the head was rotated approximately 90 degrees sideways and the stimulus was given facing forwards (i.e. head rotated contralaterally to stimulated ear) the postural sway was in a forward direction; when the head was rotated approximately 90 degrees sideways and the stimulus was given facing backwards (i.e. head rotated ipsilaterally to stimulated ear) the postural sway was in a backward direction. The mean values (mm) of body sway obtained with the head facing forwards and the eyes closed were higher than those with the eyes open (21.7 and 22.8 vs 15.7 and 14.7 for the right and left ears, respectively); higher mean values were obtained with the head turned to the side contralateral to the ear stimulated and the eyes closed (29.3 and 24.8 for the right and left ears, respectively). Under this condition the body sway was mainly in a forward direction. The sound-evoked vestibulopostural reflex seems to be a useful test for exploring the saccular function and, as a click-evoked vestibulocollic reflex, can be considered a physiological Tullio phenomenon."

  "abstract": "Background and purpose: People with peripheral vestibular pathology demonstrate motor impairments when responding and adapting to postural platform perturbations and during performance of sit-to-stand and locomotor tasks. This study investigated the influence of unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction on voluntary arm movement.\nSubjects and methods: Subjects without known neurological impairments and subjects with vestibular impairments performed 3 voluntary arm movements: an overhead reach to a target, a sideward reach to a target, and a forward flexion movement through 90 degrees. Subjects performed these tasks under precued and choice reaction time conditions. During all tasks, body segment motion was measured. Head velocity measurements were calculated for the side task only.\nResults: Subjects with vestibular loss restricted upper body segment motion within the frontal and transverse planes for the 90-degree and overhead tasks. Average angular head velocity was lower for the group with vestibular hypofunction. Task uncertainty (the introduction of a choice reaction time paradigm) differentially influenced the groups regarding head velocity at target acquisition.\nDiscussion and conclusion: Individuals with vestibular loss altered their performance of voluntary arm movements. Such alterations may have served to minimize the functional consequences of gaze instability."

  "date": "2001 Apr",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence of oral jaw behaviors concomitant to bruxism in TMD+bruxing behavior patients and in nonbruxer controls. Clinical examination, questionnaires, and specific criteria to allocate patients to mild, moderate, and severe groups of TMD and bruxers were used. The sample consisted of 274 TMD+bruxing behavior patients and 52 control non-bruxing behavior groups evaluated at the Center for the Study of TMD. The mean age of the TMD+bruxing behavior group was about 33.11 years old (range 16.66, SD = 11.52) as compared to 34.90 years old (range 17-67, SD = 14.26) in the control group. Oral jaw behaviors were assessed in the mild, moderate, and severe TMD+bruxing groups, and in the corresponding control group. It was found that the prevalence of oral jaw behaviors was higher in the TMD+bruxing behavior group as compared to the control. Hence, concomitant oral jaw behaviors predominated in bruxers and increased with its severity. The data reinforce the need to assess TMD patients in terms of the presence of bruxism, its severity, and concomitant oral jaw habits. Such approach will enable the clinician to have better understanding about the role of these behaviors in TMD. Epidemiological data was also provided regarding jutting the jaw forward (a rarely-described oral jaw habit) in a relatively large sample of TMD+bruxing patients, suggesting a more clinical intervention in children and adolescents. This study is the first to document the prevalence of specific oral jaw habits in a relatively large sample of TMD+bruxing behavior classified by degree of severity. Results suggest that TMD+bruxing patients may present many other additional oral jaw habits which may concur to increase masticatory muscle activity thus leading to TMD signs and symptoms. Factors responsible for the increased frequency of oral jaw habits with the severity of bruxism behavior remain unknown and therefore further studies are needed."

The two all female subject groups reported significantly different discomfort scores across five trials repeated in a single working day. The results of repeated video capture and two-dimensional motion analysis showed that there were trends for increased head tilt and neck flexion postures in the symptomatic subjects (n = 8), compared to the asymptomatic subjects (n = 8). Symptomatic subjects also tended to have more protracted acromions compared with asymptomatic subjects and showed greater movement excursions in the head segment and the acromion. All subjects demonstrated an approximately 10% increase in forward head posture from their relaxed sitting postures when working with the computer display, but there were no significant changes in posture as a result of time-at-work."

  "date": "2001 Dec",
  "abstract": "Postural responses to head displacements are triggered by the vestibular system; responses to body displacements are triggered by the somatosensory system. We examined the interaction of responses to combinations of head and support surface perturbations. Head displacements were always in the opposite direction of body displacements. The time between head and support surface perturbations was varied. We measured amplitude and latency of gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior EMGs for various head backward/body forward and head forward/body backward displacement combinations. These responses were compared to head-only or body-only displacement trials, which served as controls. Relative to controls, the latency of somatosensory-evoked responses to body displacement was longer and vestibular-evoked responses were absent or of low amplitude for combinations where head and support surface perturbations were presented closely in time (10-50 ms apart). These results illustrate complex integration of vestibular and somatosensory information, suggesting that the vestibulospinal and somatosensory-spinal pathways are not two isolated systems independently driving motor neurons. Rather, these pathways may influence one another at premotoneuronal levels where common circuitry may be shared by both systems."

  "title": "Understanding work-related upper extremity disorders: clinical findings in 485 computer users, musicians, and others",
  "date": "2001 Mar",
  "abstract": "Four hundred eighty five patients whose chief complaints were work related pain and other symptoms received a comprehensive upper-body clinical evaluation to determine the extent of their illness. The group had a mean age of 38.5 years. Sixty-three percent of patients were females. Seventy percent were computer users, 28% were musicians, and 2% were others engaged in repetitive work. The time between the onset of symptoms and our initial visit ranged from 2 weeks to over 17 years. A majority sought care within 30 months with the greatest number of them seeking care before 12 months. Fifty nine percent of subjects were still working when seen despite increasing pain and symptoms such as weakness, numbness, tingling, and stiffness. Following a history, a physical assessment utilizing commonly employed clinical tests were performed including evaluation of joint range of motion, hyperlaxity, muscle tenderness, pain, strength, and imbalance. Neurologic tests included Tinel's sign performed in wrist, elbow, tricipital sulcus, and neck and tests for thoracic out syndrome (TOS). Specific tests such as Finkelstein's test for deQuervain's tenosynovitis, Phalen's test for carpal tunnel syndrome and grip strengths were included in the examination protocol. Significant findings included postural misalignment with protracted shoulders (78%), head forward position (71%), neurogenic TOS (70%), cervical radiculopathy (0.03%), evidence of sympathetic dysfunction (20%), and complex regional pain syndrome (RSD) (0.6%). Hyperlaxity of fingers and elbows was found in over 50%, carpal tunnel syndrome in 8%, radial tunnel syndrome in 7%, cubital tunnel in 64%, shoulder impingement in 13%, medial epicondylitis in 60%, lateral epicondylitis in 33%, and peripheral muscle weakness in 70%. We conclude that despite initial presentation distally, work-related upper-extremity disorders are a diffuse neuromuscular illness with significant proximal upper-body findings that affect distal function. While neurogenic TOS remains a controversial diagnosis, the substantial number of patients with positive clinical findings in this study lends weight to the concept that posture related neurogenic TOS is a key factor in the cascading series of physical events that characterize this illness. A comprehensive upper-body examination produces findings that cannot be obtained through laboratory tests and surveys alone and lays the ground work for generating hypotheses about the etiology of work related upper-extremity disorders that can be tested in controlled investigations."

  "abstract": "The responses of neurons in the medial column of the inferior olive to translational and rotational optic flow were recorded from anaesthetized pigeons. Panoramic translational or rotational flowfields were produced by mechanical devices that projected optic flow patterns onto the walls, ceiling and floor of the room. The axis of rotation/translation could be positioned to any orientation in three-dimensional space such that axis tuning could be determined. Each neuron was assigned a vector representing the axis about/along which the animal would rotate/translate to produce the flowfield that elicited maximal modulation. Both translation-sensitive and rotation-sensitive neurons were found. For neurons responsive to translational optic flow, the preferred axis is described with reference to a standard right-handed coordinate system, where +x, +y and +z represent rightward, upward and forward translation of the animal, respectively (assuming that all recordings were from the right side of the brain). t(+y) neurons were maximally excited in response to a translational optic flowfield that results from self-translation upward along the vertical (y) axis. t(-y) neurons also responded best to translational optic flow along the vertical axis but showed the opposite direction preference. The two remaining groups, t(-x+z) and t(-x-z) neurons, responded best to translational optic flow along horizontal axes that were oriented 45 degrees to the midline. There were two types of neurons responsive to rotational optic flow: rVA neurons preferred rotation about the vertical axis, and rH135c neurons preferred rotation about a horizontal axis at 135 degrees contralateral azimuth. The locations of marking lesions indicated a clear topographical organization of the six response types. In summary, our results reinforce that the olivo-cerebellar system dedicated to the analysis of optic flow is organized according to a reference frame consisting of three approximately orthogonal axes: the vertical axis, and two horizontal axes oriented 45 degrees to either side the midline. Previous research has shown that the eye muscles, vestibular semicircular canals and postural control system all share a similar spatial frame of reference."

  "title": "Modulation of the soleus H-reflex in prone human subjects using galvanic vestibular stimulation",
  "date": "2001 Nov",
  "abstract": "Objectives: To determine if vestibular-evoked modulation of the soleus H-reflex can be achieved in a muscle that is not being used for postural support.\nMethods: Ten healthy subjects lay prone while the right leg was supported. In this position soleus H-reflex amplitudes were measured with the head facing forward, coupled with ipsilateral monopolar monaural galvanic stimulation (anode or cathode). To evaluate the interval between the onset of the galvanic stimulus and tibial nerve stimulation, the timing was varied between 0 and 200 ms in 20 ms intervals. A two-way ANOVA and student's t-test was performed to compare the mean amplitudes of the test and conditioned H-reflexes.\nResults: Galvanic stimulation significantly modified the amplitude of the H-reflex in a prone lying subject (P<0.05). Furthermore, the peak inhibitory and facilitatory effect occurred when the galvanic vestibular stimulus was delivered 100 ms prior to the H-reflex stimulus.\nConclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that galvanic stimulation can modulate the excitability of the soleus motoneuron pool when the muscle is not being used posturally. This suggests that in certain situations, it may be possible to use this type of vestibular stimulation to examine the integrity of descending vestibulospinal pathways in prone human subjects."

  "title": "The association between cervical excursion angles and cervical short flexor muscle endurance",
  "date": "1998",
  "abstract": "This study employed a randomly selected sample of 427 never-injured subjects to examine the relationship between poor posture and deep cervical short flexor muscle endurance. Poor posture was described as extreme angular excursion of both the upper and lower aspects of the cervical spine. For both men and women, poor deep cervical short flexor muscle endurance was associated only with extremely large excursion angles traced by the upper cervical spine, that is, head posture associated with excessive cervical lordosis rather than a forward translated head position. Further research is needed to clearly define poor cervical posture, and to investigate the specific relationship of deep short cervical flexor endurance with head on neck posture, in order that postural correction is specific to the underlying biomechanics."

  "title": "Motor coordination in weightless conditions revealed by long-term microgravity adaptation",
  "date": "2001 Aug-Nov",
  "abstract": "The functional approach to studying human motor systems attempts to give a better understanding of the processes behind planning movements and their coordinated performance by relying on weightlessness as a particularly enlightening experimental condition. Indeed, quantitative monitoring of sensorimotor adaptation of subjects exposed to weightlessness outlines the functional role of gravity in motor and postural organization. The recent accessibility of the MIR Space Station has allowed for the first time experimental quantitative kinematic analysis of long-term sensorimotor and postural adaptation to the weightless environment though opto-electronic techniques. In the frame of the EUROMIR'95 Mission, two protocols of voluntary posture perturbation (erect posture, EP; forward trunk bending, FTB) were carried out during four months of microgravity exposure. Results show that postural strategies for quasistatic body orientation in weightlessness are based on the alignment of geometrical body axes (head and trunk) along external references. A proper whole body positioning appears to be recovered only after months of microgravity exposure. By contrast, typically, terrestrial strategies of co-ordination between movement and posture are promptly restored and used when performing motor activities in the weightless environment. This result is explained under the assumption that there may be different sensorimotor integration processes for static and dynamic postural function and that the organisation of coordinated movement might rely stably on egocentric references and kinematics synergies for motor control."

  "title": "Postural stability using different neck positions in normal subjects and patients with neck trauma",
  "date": "2000 Mar",
  "abstract": "Subjects with neck problems, such as whiplash injuries, often complain of disturbed equilibrium and, in some instances, provocation of the neck position can elicit such problems. The importance of neck proprioceptors for maintaining balance is gaining increased interest, moreover the function or malfunction of the otoliths may disturb equilibrium in certain head positions. The aim of the study was to create a reference material for postural control and its dependence on head position in healthy subjects and to compare this with a set of patients with known neck problems and associated vertiginous problems. A total of 32 healthy subjects (16 men, 16 women, age range 21-58 years) as well as 10 patients age range 27-62 years (mean 44 years) with neck problems and associated balance problems since a whiplash injury were tested for postural control using the EquiTest dynamic posturographic model. The normal subjects were initially split into four age groups in order to estimate the effects of age on performance. The postural stability was evaluated for dependence of support surface conditions (stable or sway-referenced), visual input (eyes open or closed) and head position (neutral, left rotated, right rotated, extended backwards or flexed forward) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc test in case of a significant factor effect. As expected, visual cues as well as stable support surface improve postural stability (p < 0.001). Postural stability is statistically different in the head extended backwards condition compared with the other four head positions (p < 0.001 in all cases) in both patients and controls. Eliminating this test condition from the analysis, only a slight (p < 0.05) difference between head forwards and head turned left remained. This pattern of results remained if the normal subjects were only split into two age groups instead of four. Finally, the patient group exhibited significantly lower postural performance than all the groups of normal subjects (p <0.01), but none of the normal groups differed significantly from each other. It is concluded that the postural control system is significantly challenged in the head extended backwards condition in both normal subjects and patients with previous whiplash injury and persistent neck problems. The patient group differed statistically from all groups of normal subjects. This suggests that neck problems impair postural control, and that the head extended position is a more challenging task for the postural system to adapt to. Whether this is due to utricular malpositioning, central integrative functions or cervical proprioceptive afferents is not within the scope of this study to answer."

  "date": "2000 May",
  "abstract": "This study evaluates the process of relapse after mandibular setback surgery by an analysis of the role of craniofacial morphology, hyoid position, pharyngeal airway and head posture. Subjects examined were 62 patients who received the sagittal split ramus osteotomies (SSRO). Changes of the craniofacial and related structures were evaluated from the serial cephalograms up to 3 years after the surgery. Results indicated that mandibular relapse represented by Pg occurred mostly within 6 months after the surgery. A net setback of the mandible was 9.1 mm and the superior move was 1.7 mm, with a reduction of 7.2 mm in mandibular length, 4.2 mm in ramus height, 3.7 mm in posterior face height, 2.6 degrees in gonial angle, an increase of 2.9 degrees in mandibular plane angle (MPA) by the last examination. Hyoid bone moved backward and downward and head posture was raised. The forward relapse of Pg was correlated with the changes of ANB, MPA, ramus height and hyoid position. Only hyoid position was predictably correlated with mandibular morphology and head posture. These findings suggest that mandibular setback alters the relationship among the hyoid position, pharyngeal airway and the head posture. It might be critical, therefore, relapse is closely monitored and controlled before the full healing of fragments and new muscular balance is established."

Standing posture measured from the sagittal and frontal planes of 13 students was recorded photographically under several load carrying conditions. Cervical and shoulder position angles were calculated and compared. Results revealed that both backpack weight and time carried influenced cervical and shoulder posture. Forward head posture increased when carrying a backpack, especially one with a heavy load. Carrying a backpack weighing 15% of body weight appeared to be too heavy to maintain standing posture for adolescents. These findings have implications for future load carrying studies in adolescents."

  "abstract": "Background: The upper extremities are often used to protect the head and torso from impact with an object or with the ground. We tested the null hypotheses that neither age nor gender would affect the time required for healthy adults to move their upper extremities into a protective posture.\nMethods: Twenty young (mean age 25 years) and twenty older (mean age 70 years) volunteers, with equal gender representation, performed a seated arm-movement task under three conditions: Condition 1, in which subjects were instructed to raise the hands upon cue as quickly as possible from thigh level to a shoulder height target; Condition 2, in which subjects were instructed as in Condition 1 with the addition of intercepting a swinging pendulum at the prescribed hand target; and Condition 3, in which subjects were instructed as in Condition 2 but were asked to wait as long as possible before initiating hand movement to intercept the pendulum. Arm movements were quantified using standard kinematic techniques.\nResults: Age (p <.01) and gender (p <.05) affected hand movement times. In Conditions 1 and 2, the older women required 20% longer movement times than the other subject groups (335 vs 279 milliseconds; p <.01). In Condition 3, shorter movement times were achieved by young men (20%; p =.002) and older women (10%; p =.056) as compared with their respective performance in Conditions 1 and 2 because they did not fully decelerate their hands. The other groups slowed their movements in Condition 3.\nConclusions: Age, gender, and perceived threat significantly affected movement times. However, even the slowest movement times were well within the time available to deploy the hands in a forward fall to the ground."

  "date": "2001 Aug",
  "abstract": "The present study addressed the question whether the deviant postural adjustments in children with spastic diplegia can be attributed to their crouched sitting position or primarily to their neural deficit. Postural adjustments during sitting in an erect and in a crouched position on a movable platform were assessed in 10 children, aged 3 to 7 years 6 months, with mild-to-severe forms of spastic diplegia and 10 age- and sex-matched control children. Multiple surface EMGs of neck, trunk, and leg muscles and kinematics of head, body sway, and pelvis were recorded during forward and backward translations. The children with normal motor development showed a distinct adaptation of postural adjustments to sitting position. The children with cerebral palsy (CP) had a deficient adaptational capacity which was more pronounced in the erect than in the crouched position. Thus, the crouched sitting position did not induce postural deficiency but seemed to offer a solution to the sensory-motor problem of the instability experienced. Children with severe diplegia exhibited a lack of direction specificity in the leg muscles during backward body sway, which points to a basic deficit in postural control. In addition, these children showed marked dysfunctions in the precise tuning of the postural adjustments to task-specific conditions. In the children with mild-to-moderate forms of CP the basic level of control was intact."

  "date": "2001 Apr",
  "abstract": "The present study examined the associations between craniofacial dimensions, head posture, bite force, and symptoms and signs of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). The sample comprised 96 children (51F, 45M) aged 7-13 years, sequentially admitted for orthodontic treatment of malocclusions entailing health risks. Symptoms and signs of TMD were assessed by 37 variables describing the occurrence of headache and facial pain, clicking, jaw mobility, tenderness of muscles and joints, and the Helkimo Anamnestic and Dysfunction indices. Craniofacial dimensions (33 variables), and head and cervical posture (nine variables) were recorded from lateral cephalometric radiographs taken with the subject standing with the head in a standardized posture (mirror position). Dental arch widths were measured on plaster casts and bite force was measured at the first molars on each side by means of a pressure transducer. Associations were assessed by Spearman correlations and multiple stepwise logistic regression analyses. The magnitudes of the significant associations were generally low to moderate. On average, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction was seen in connection with a marked forward inclination of the upper cervical spine and an increased craniocervical angulation, but no firm conclusion could be made regarding any particular craniofacial morphology in children with symptoms and signs of TMJ dysfunction. Muscle tenderness was associated with a 'long face' type of craniofacial morphology and a lower bite force. Headache was associated with a larger maxillary length and increased maxillary prognathism. A high score on Helkimo's Clinical Dysfunction Index was associated with smaller values of a number of vertical, horizontal, and transversal linear craniofacial dimensions and a lower bite force."

  "abstract": "One hundred male obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients were classified into 2 groups, on the basis of Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), as severe (AHI > or = 50) and non-severe (AHI < 50). A comprehensive cephalometric analysis of cervicocraniofacial skeletal morphology and upper airway soft tissue morphology was performed in 51 non-severe OSA patients, 49 severe OSA patients, and 36 controls with the purpose of examining the different features among these 3 groups. Sixty-eight cephalometric variables were compared among these 3 groups by 1-way analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni test. The results showed that both OSA groups had aberrations of cervicocraniofacial skeletal morphology and upper airway soft tissue morphology versus the controls. Severe OSA patients demonstrated increased maxillo-mandibular retrognathism, with a high mandibular plane angle resulting from increased anterior lower facial height and decreased posterior lower facial height, versus the non-severe OSA group. The craniocervical extension, forward head posture, inferiorly positioned hyoid bone, and the enlarged and elongated soft palate and upright tongue posture were more exaggerated as well. These findings imply that there should be different treatment regimens for the 2 subgroups of OSA patients to achieve treatment success. Cephalometric analysis is therefore highly recommended to verify the aberrant cervicocraniofacial morphology in severe and non-severe OSA patients."

  "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether head movement in response to a sudden platform translation differs between healthy young subjects and healthy elderly with and without, bipedal sensory loss.\nDesign: A cross-sectional study with four-way comparison on subject grouping and three test conditions.\nBackground: Head movement has been used as a measure of balance in the elderly during voluntary movements. Studies during involuntary movement, however, are limited. Moreover, it is not clear how head movement during involuntary activities relates to postural balance and susceptibility to falls.\nMethods: Head movement during a sudden base translation was measured in three subject groups: 9 healthy young, 10 healthy elderly adults and 10 elderly adults with vibratory sensation loss under the feet. The surface compliance of the supporting base, the direction of the base translation and the visual condition were all varied.\nResults: There were significant differences among the three groups in head range of excursion (5 degrees, 9 degrees, 13 degrees for the young, elderly, and elderly with severe vibratory sensation loss, respectively), onset time (120, 150, 180 ms), and the time from peak to peak (38, 29, 25 ms). A backward base movement increased the head movement more than a forward base movement.\nConclusions: During sudden base translation balance tasks, head movement is significantly increased in the elderly, especially in those elderly adults who are susceptible to falls. The results suggest that an increased head movement in the elderly might be an indication of increased risks for falls."

  "abstract": "Background: We tested the hypothesis that in humans, hypertension/tachycardia and hypotension/bradycardia nonbaroreflex sequences that occur within spontaneous arterial pressure (AP) and R-R interval fluctuations are an expression of positive feedback mechanisms neurally regulating the cardiovascular system.\nMethods and results: We studied 15 spinal cord-injured (SCI) subjects (8 tetraplegics and 7 paraplegics) and 8 healthy subjects. The occurrence of nonbaroreflex (NBseq) and baroreflex (Bseq) sequences, ie, hypertension-bradycardia and hypotension-tachycardia sequences, was assessed during rest and head-up tilt (HUT). The ratio between Bseq and NBseq (B/NB ratio) was also calculated. In resting conditions, the occurrence of NBseq was significantly lower (P:<0.05) in tetraplegics (7.9+/-1.5) than in paraplegics (16.2+/-3.2) and normal subjects (19.0+/-3.5), whereas the occurrence of Bseq was not significantly different between the 3 groups (38.6+/-11.9 versus 45.4+/-6.0 versus 47.0+/-11.9). In tetraplegics, the B/NB ratio showed a marked, significant decrease (from 8.4+/-4.2 to 1.9+/-0.8, P:<0.05) in response to HUT, whereas in normal subjects, it showed a significant increase (from 3.5+/-0.7 to 9.4+/-2.7, P:<0.05). In paraplegics, the B/NB ratio did not change significantly in response to HUT (from 4.5+/-1.6 to 4.8+/-1.1).\nConclusions: Our data suggest that nonbaroreflex sequences occur in humans and might represent the expression of an integrated, neurally mediated, feed-forward type of short-term cardiovascular regulation that is able to interact dynamically with feedback mechanisms of baroreflex origin."

  "date": "2000",
  "abstract": "We present a clinical classification of central vestibular syndromes according to the three major planes of action of the vestibulo-ocular reflex: yaw, roll, and pitch. The plane-specific syndromes are determined by ocular motor, postural, and perceptual signs. Yaw plane signs are horizontal nystagmus, past pointing, rotational and lateral body falls, deviation of perceived straight-ahead to the left or right. Roll plane signs are torsional nystagmus, skew deviation, ocular torsion, tilts of head, body, and perceived vertical in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Pitch plane signs are upbeat/downbeat nystagmus, forward/backward tilts and falls, deviations of the perceived horizon. The thus defined vestibular syndromes allow a precise topographic analysis of brainstem lesions according to their level and side. Special emphasis is placed on the vestibular roll plane syndromes of ocular tilt reaction, lateropulsion in Wallenberg's syndrome, thalamic and cortical astasia and their association with roll plane tilt of perceived vertical. Recovery is based on a functionally significant central compensation of a vestibular tone imbalance, the mechanism of which is largely unknown. Physical therapy may facilitate this central compensation, but this has not yet been proven in prospective studies."

  "date": "2001 Jan",
  "abstract": "During forward locomotion, guinea pigs adopted a posture which, although different, was as stereotyped as at rest. The whole extent of the vertebral column was extended, parallel to the earth-horizontal plane. This result supports the hypothesis that, in mammals, gaze and postural control by the central nervous system would be simplified by the adoption of a limited number of skeletal configurations. They would be optimized for energy saving, biomechanical efficacy and limitation of the number of degrees of freedom of the skeletal apparatus. Transition between rest and forward locomotion displayed two prominent characteristics: the head was stabilized versus space throughout the whole transition and the modifications of the skeletal geometry were confined to the median plane and to two major articular regions. Such an organization revealed a fourth characteristic of the guinea pig postural control: the skeletal configurations retained by evolution would ensure that smooth transitions take place between rest and the various activities of its motor repertoire. Finally, our purely descriptive data shed new light on the architecture of the neuronal network which underlies the vestibular control of gaze and posture."

  "abstract": "This study was conducted in order to determine the effect of head and neck position on bilateral electromyographic (EMG) activity of the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The study was performed on 16 patients with myogenic cranio-cervical-mandibular dysfunction (CMD) and 16 healthy subjects. EMG recordings at rest and during swallowing of saliva and maximal voluntary clenching were performed by placing surface electrodes on the right and left sternocleidomastoid muscles. EMG activity was recorded in the left lateral decubitus position, in a darkened room and with the individual's eyes closed, under the following experimental conditions: 1. Head, neck, and body horizontally aligned; 2. Head and neck upwardly inclined with respect to the body, simulating the effect of a thick pillow, 3. Head and neck downwardly inclined with respect to the body, simulating the effect of a thin pillow. Variation of head and neck positions was determined by measuring the distance from the angle of neck and shoulder and the apex of the shoulder (SND = shoulder-neck distance) of each individual. Then, head and neck were forward or downwardly inclined with respect to the body at one-third of SND. A significantly higher contralateral EMG activity and a more asymmetric EMG activity were observed in the CMD group than in the healthy subjects (Kruskal-Wallis Test). These results suggest a different behavior of bilateral sternocleidomastoid EMG activity in CMD patients than in healthy subjects depending on the positioning of the head and neck."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of FHP on the initial occlusal contact pattern (IOCP) in order to provide further clarification on this important topic. Thirty-nine healthy subjects, 10-74 years old, underwent a series of tests in which the IOCP was recorded in four different head positions using the T-Scan Occlusal Diagnostic System. Three tests each were performed in military posture (MP), natural sitting posture (NP), FHP, and maximal forward head posture (MFHP) for a total of twelve trials. A repeated measures analysis of variance failed to demonstrate a correlation between FHP and IOCP; however, a multiple linear regression analysis revealed a relationship between age and the IOCP. This study raises questions about the relationship between FHP and occlusion."

Any statistically significant differences between the groups thoracic hyperkyphosis and thoracic hypokyphosis--were analysed using Student's t test. Subjects with thoracic hyperkyphosis had a larger atlantocervical angle (At/ CVT, P < 0.01) than subjects with thoracic hypokyphosis. However, head position (NSL/VER) was similar in both groups, probably owing to the visual perception control of craniovertical relation. There was no statistically significant difference in craniofacial morphologyy between the groups."

  "date": "2000 Aug",
  "abstract": "We proposed to study and quantify the anteroposterior component, on top of the lateral one, of the body sway induced by different configurations of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in order to advance the understanding of the orientation of the response. Four stimulation configurations were used in two separate experiments: monaural, binaural, and opposite double monaural in the first experiment (11 subjects); monaural and double monaural in the second (13 subjects). The postural response of the subjects, standing with their eyes closed, to the stimulus (0.6 mA, 4 s) was assessed by measuring the displacement of the center of pressure (CoP) using a force platform. As usual, binaural GVS induced a strictly lateral deviation of the center of pressure. The opposite double monaural condition induced a similar lateral sway to that obtained in the binaural mode, although with a very different stimulation configuration. Monaural GVS induced an oblique, stereotyped deviation in each subject. The anteroposterior component comprised a forward deviation when the anode was on the forehead and a backward deviation when the anode was on the mastoid. The lateral component, directed towards the anode as in the binaural design, was twice as large in the binaural than in the monaural mode. The second experiment showed that double monaural stimulation elicited an anteroposterior deviation (backwards when the anode was on the mastoids and forwards when it was on the forehead) that was equivalent to the addition of two complementary monaural configurations. The present results show that monaural stimulation activates one side of the vestibular apparatus and induces reproducible, stereotyped deviations of the CoP in both the anteroposterior and lateral plane. Secondly, binaural GVS appears to result from the addition of two complementary monaural stimulations. Lateral components of the response to each stimulation, being in the same direction, are summed, whilst anteroposterior components, being in opposite directions, cancel each other out. The opposite happens when both labyrinths are polarized in the same way, as in the double monaural configuration. We suggest that the orientation of the response to GVS is a function of the imbalance between right and left vestibular polarization, rather than a function of the actual position of the electrodes."

  "title": "Coordination of a step with a reach",
  "date": "2000",
  "abstract": "Although natural reaching behavior can easily include forward body movement, most laboratory studies of reaching have constrained the body to be stationary. Recently, however, it has been shown that normal subjects exhibit a different pattern of errors when attempting to pinpoint remembered target locations, depending on whether or not the reach includes a step. In the study of Flanders et al., these errors appeared to be due to the strategy of eye/head/hand coordination which normally comes into play when the body is moving toward the target. Since the spatial positioning of the head was found to partially explain the errors in hand placement, the present study examined the movements of patients with bilateral vestibular deficits in order to further analyze the whole-body coordination. Somewhat surprisingly, the patients exhibited the same pattern of head movement and the same errors in hand placement as did the control subjects. Nevertheless, the patients' movements clearly exhibited evidence for an abnormal decomposition of elbow extension and trunk rotation. Furthermore the patients' (spatial) hand paths were significantly more curved than those of control subjects and, only in the patients, paths to remembered targets were significantly more curved than paths to visible targets. Thus for movements to remembered targets, the patients tended to move the hand to the same incorrect spatial positions as control subjects but spatiotemporal aspects of the arm and body movement differed. The results are consistent with the idea that vestibular patients are overly dependent upon visual cues, and support the hypothesis that this stepping and reaching behavior is largely dependent upon a visual reference signal."

  "title": "[Nasal respiration and recurrence]",
  "date": "2000 Apr",
  "abstract": "Cause and effect relationships existing between \"nasal breathing impairment\" and \"relapse\" have inherited from controversies which have animated the debate between the different schools of orthodontics for more than a century. Those differences of opinion seem to have their origin in the lack of accuracy inherent with the general acceptance of the two concepts of \"normal nasal ventilation\" and \"relapse\". Rather than retracing their history, we would like to put forward a few proposals aimed at getting rid of the doubtful trouble the present difficulty confronts us with. We have therefore endeavored: 1. to define most exactly our concepts of \"optimal nasal ventilation\" and \"relapse\"; 2. to determine, afterwards, the mechanics responsible for facial shape alterations due to nasal obstruction; 3. hence, to deduce the therapeutic behavior enabling us to master those alterations more extensively. Bearing in mind that, in order to legitimate the risk of a treatment, acknowledge its benefit and justify its cost (which may become prohibitive because of relapse), the clinician has to base his options on a body of consistent arguments."

  "date": "2000 Jun",
  "abstract": "The torsional eye movements induced by the right and left ear-down position are known as \"ocular counter-rolling\" but the mechanism of the horizontal and vertical eye movements has not been clarified. The vertical eye movements induced by backward tilt are known as the \"doll reflex\", but clear eye movements are induced by forward tilt. The mechanism of horizontal and torsional eye movements are unclear. To detect 3D eye movements in the roll and pitch planes, we performed 3D analysis of eye movements by our video-oculographic method. During roll tilt, counter-torsional eye movements were clearly induced, but no definite, eye movements were observed in the horizontal and vertical components of eye movements. During pitch tilt, downward eye movements were observed following backward tilt, but no clear eye movements were observed following forward tilt. Moreover, no clear horizontal or torsional eye movements were observed during pitch tilt. These results suggest that the response to pitch tilt depends on the saccular input."

  "title": "Neck muscle vibration makes walking humans accelerate in the direction of gaze",
  "date": "2000 Jun 15",
  "abstract": "We studied the effect of the continuous vibration of symmetrical dorsal neck muscles in seven normal subjects during (a) quiet standing, (b) stepping in place movements and (c) walking on the treadmill. The experiments were performed in a darkened room and the subjects were given the instruction not to resist the applied perturbation. In one condition the velocity of the treadmill was controlled by feedback from the subject's current position. Head, trunk and leg motion were recorded at 100 Hz. In normal standing, neck vibration elicited a prominent forward body sway. During stepping in place, neck vibration produced an involuntary forward stepping at about 0.3 m s-1 without modifying the stepping frequency. If the head was turned horizontally 45 and 90 deg to the right or to the left, neck muscle vibration caused stepping approximately in the direction of the head naso-occipital axis. For lateral eye deviations, the direction of stepping was roughly aligned with gaze direction. In treadmill locomotion, neck vibration produced an involuntary step-like increase of walking speed (by 0.1-0.6 m s-1), independent of the initial walking speed. During backward locomotion, the walking speed tended to decrease during neck vibration. Thus, continuous neck vibration evokes changes in the postural reference during quiet standing and in the walking speed during locomotion. The results suggest that the proprioceptive input from the neck is integrated in the control of human posture and locomotion and is processed in the context of a viewer-centred reference frame."

  "date": "2000 May",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study was conducted to compare craniofacial relationships, position, and curvature of the cervical spine between children with cleft lip and cleft palate who had been operated on and children without clefts.\nMethod: This study was performed in 28 children with mixed dentition. They were divided into two groups. The study group included 14 children with unilateral operated cleft lip and cleft palate, ranging in age from 6 to 12 years, who clinically presented with a short upper lip, abnormal lip seal, and inhibition of sagittal development of the midface that was radiographically assessed. The control group included 14 children without clefts, ranging in age from 8 to 11 years. All of them had normal lip seal, nasal breathing, and a clinically normal body posture.\nDesign: A lateral craniocervical radiograph in a self-balanced natural head position in an erect posture, and without using a head holder, was taken for each child of both groups, with the mandible in maximum intercuspation and lips in habitual posture. The true vertical was marked on all the films. Specific angular and linear dimensions were used to assess the craniocervical relationships, as were the position of the cervical spine, its curvature, or both.\nResults and conclusions: The study group presented a significant increase in the extension of the head on the neck, forward position of the cervical spine, and a decrease in the curvature of the cervical spine in comparison with the children without clefts. These results are more relevant considering that the study group also presented higher significant values of lower facial height than children without clefts."

  "date": "2000 Apr",
  "abstract": "The influence of head posture on movement paths of the incisal point (IP) and of the mandibular condyles during free open-close movements was studied. Ten persons, without craniomandibular or cervical spine disorders, participated in the study. Open close mandibular movements were recorded with the head in five postures, viz., natural head posture, forward head posture, military posture, and lateroflexion to the right and to the left side, using the Oral Kinesiologic Analysis System (OKAS-3D). This study showed that in a military head posture, the opening movement path of the incisal point is shifted anteriorly relative to the path in a natural head posture. In a forward head posture, the movement path is shifted posteriorly whereas during lateroflexion, it deviates to the side the head has moved to. Moreover, the intra-articular distance in the temporomandibular joint during closing is smaller with the head in military posture and greater in forward head posture, as compared to the natural head posture. During lateroflexion, the intra-articular distance on the ipsilateral side is smaller. The influence of head posture upon the kinematics of the mandible is probably a manifestation of differences in mandibular loading in the different head postures."

  "date": "2000 May",
  "abstract": "Catalepsy, a symptom of Parkinson's disease and related disorders can be produced in rats and other laboratory animals by the blockade of nigrostriatal dopamine using dopaminergic antagonists such as haloperidol. When haloperidol-induced cataleptic rats are placed facing downward on an inclined plane, they will brace against the resulting downward force by pushing backwards, and if they lose postural stability, or their position on the inclined plane, they will jump forward. Females, however, jump from the inclined plane at a significantly lower angle than do males. Frame-by-frame analysis of the jumping sequences revealed that females and males use a different combination of postural adjustments to maintain their position on the inclined plane prior to jumping. Furthermore, gonadal hormone manipulations at birth and in adulthood reveal that these sex differences in postural adjustments are dependent on the organizational effects of gonadal hormones in the perinatal period. These results provide evidence for sex differences in postural support mechanisms and suggest that the sex of subjects, or their hormonal state, must be considered when studying the behavioral aspects of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease which include a postural component."

  "title": "Effects of reversible inactivation of the primate mesencephalic reticular formation. I. Hypermetric goal-directed saccades",
  "date": "2000 Apr",
  "abstract": "Single-neuron recording and electrical microstimulation suggest three roles for the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) in oculomotor control: 1) saccade triggering, 2) computation of the horizontal component of saccade amplitude (a feed-forward function), and 3) feedback of an eye velocity signal from the paramedian zone of the pontine reticular formation (PPRF) to higher structures. These ideas were tested using reversible inactivation of the MRF with pressure microinjection of muscimol, a GABA(A) agonist, in four rhesus monkeys prepared for chronic single-neuron and eye movement recording. Reversible inactivation revealed two subregions of the MRF: ventral-caudal and rostral. The ventral-caudal region, which corresponds to the central MRF, the cMRF, or nucleus subcuneiformis, is the focus of this paper and is located lateral to the oculomotor nucleus and caudal to the posterior commissure (PC). Inactivation of the cMRF produced contraversive, upward saccade hypermetria. In three of eight injections, the velocity of hypermetric saccades was too fast for a given saccade amplitude, and saccade duration was shorter. The latency for initiation of most contraversive saccades was markedly reduced. Fixation was also destabilized with the development of macrosaccadic square-wave jerks that were directed toward a contraversive goal in the hypermetric direction. Spontaneous saccades collected in total darkness were also directed toward the same orbital goal, up and to the contraversive side. Three of eight muscimol injections were associated with a shift in the initial position of the eyes. A contralateral head tilt was also observed in 5 out of 8 caudal injections. All ventral-caudal injections with head tilt showed no evidence of vertical postsaccadic drift. This suggested that the observed changes in head movement and posture resulted from inactivation of the caudal MRF and not spread of the muscimol to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC). Evidence of hypermetria strongly supports the idea that the ventral-caudal MRF participates in the feedback control of saccade accuracy. However, development of goal-directed eye movements, as well as a shift in the initial position following some of the cMRF injections, suggest that this region also contributes to the generation of an estimate of target or eye position coded in craniotopic coordinates. Last, the observed reduction in contraversive saccade latency and development of macrosaccadic square-wave jerks supports a role of the MRF in saccade triggering."

The rotation test was performed with the subject's head in the primary position (upright) and with the head 30 degree pitched down. Computerized electronystagmography was used to measure the maximum slow component velocity of the horizontal nystagmus and to calculate gain, phase and asymmetry. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain obtained during rotation with the head in the primary position was significantly higher than with the head bent 30 degree forward. No other significant differences were found."

  "abstract": "Background: Many practitioners have found that posture training has a positive impact on temporomandibular, or TMD, symptoms. The authors conducted a study to evaluate its effectiveness.\nMethods: Sixty patients with TMD and a primary muscle disorder were randomized into two groups: one group received posture training and TMD self-management instructions while the control group received TMD self-management instructions only. Four weeks after the study began, the authors reexamined the subjects for changes in symptoms, pain-free opening and pressure algometer pain thresholds. In addition, pretreatment and posttreatment posture measurements were recorded for subjects in the treatment group.\nResults: Statistically significant improvement was demonstrated by the modified symptom severity index, maximum pain-free opening and pressure algometer threshold measurements, as well as by the subjects' perceived TMD and neck symptoms. Subjects in the treatment group reported having experienced a mean reduction in TMD and neck symptoms of 41.9 and 38.2 percent, respectively, while subjects in the control group reported a mean reduction in these symptoms of 8.1 and 9.3 percent. Within the treatment group, the authors found significant correlations between improvements in TMD symptoms and improvements in neck symptoms (P < .005) as well as between TMD symptom improvement and the difference between head and shoulder posture measurements at the outset of treatment (P < .05).\nConclusions: Posture training and TMD self-management instructions are significantly more effective than TMD self-management instructions alone for patients with TMD who have a primary muscle disorder.\nPractice implications: Patients with TMD who hold their heads farther forward relative to the shoulders have a high probability of experiencing symptom improvement as a result of posture training and being provided with selfmanagement instructions."

  "date": "2000 Jan",
  "abstract": "The aim of the present investigation was to see whether the kinematic synergy responsible for equilibrium control during upper trunk movement was preserved in absence of gravity constraints. In this context, forward trunk movements were studied during both straight-and-level flights (earth-normal gravity condition: normogravity) and periods of weightlessness in parabolic flights (microgravity). Five standing adult subjects had their feet attached to a platform, their eyes were open, and their hands were clasped behind their back. They were instructed to bend the trunk (the head and the trunk together) forward by approximately 35 degrees with respect to the vertical in the sagittal plane as fast as possible in response to a tone, and then to hold the final position for 3 s. The initial and final anteroposterior center of mass (CM) positions (i.e., 200 ms before the onset of the movement and 400 ms after the offset of the movement, respectively), the time course of the anteroposterior CM shift during the movement, and the electromyographic (EMG) pattern of the main muscles involved in the movement were studied under both normo- and microgravity. The kinematic synergy was quantified by performing a principal components analysis on the hip, knee, and ankle angle changes occurring during the movement. The results indicate that 1) the anteroposterior position of the CM remains minimized during performance of forward trunk movement in microgravity, in spite of the absence of equilibrium constraints; 2) the strong joint coupling between hip, knee, and ankle, which characterizes the kinematic synergy in normogravity and which is responsible for the minimization of the CM shift during movement, is preserved in microgravity. It represents an invariant parameter controlled by the CNS. 3) The EMG pattern underlying the kinematic synergy is deeply reorganized. This is in contrast with the invariance of the kinematic synergy. It is concluded that during short-term microgravity episodes, the kinematic synergy that minimizes the anteroposterior CM shift is surprisingly preserved due to fast adaptation of the muscle forces to the new constraint."

  "abstract": "Objective: To develop a new sitting spinal model and an optimal driver's seat by using review of the literature of seated positions of the head. spine, pelvis, and lower extremities.\nData selection: Searches included MEDLINE for scientific journals, engineering standards, and textbooks. Key terms included sitting ergonomics, sitting posture, spine model, seat design, sitting lordosis, sitting electromyography, seated vibration, and sitting and biomechanics.\nData synthesis: In part I, papers were selected if (1) they contained a first occurrence of a sitting topic, (2) were reviews of the literature, (3) corrected errors in previous studies, or (4) had improved study designs compared with previous papers. In part II, we separated information pertaining to sitting dynamics and drivers of automobiles from part 1.\nResults: Sitting causes the pelvis to rotate backward and causes reduction in lumbar lordosis, trunk-thigh angle, and knee angle and an increase in muscle effort and disc pressure. Seated posture is affected by seat-back angle, seat-bottom angle and foam density, height above floor, and presence of armrests.\nConclusion: The configuration of the spine, postural position, and weight transfer is different in the 3 types of sitting: anterior, middle, and posterior. Lumbar lordosis is affected by the trunk-thigh angle and the knee angle. Subjects in seats with backrest inclinations of 110 to 130 degrees, with concomitant lumbar support, have the lowest disc pressures and lowest electromyography recordings from spinal muscles. A seat-bottom posterior inclination of 5 degrees and armrests can further reduce lumbar disc pressures and electromyography readings while seated. To reduce forward translated head postures, a seat-back inclination of 110 degrees is preferable over higher inclinations. Work objects, such as video monitors, are optimum at eye level. Forward-tilting, seat-bottom inclines can increase lordosis, but subjects give high comfort ratings to adjustable chairs, which allow changes in position."

  "title": "Does 2 years' nocturnal treatment with a mandibular advancement splint in adult patients with snoring and OSAS cause a change in the posture of the mandible?",
  "date": "1999 Dec",
  "abstract": "The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of 2 years' nocturnal treatment with a mandibular advancement splint in adult patients with snoring and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with respect to possible development of a forward position of the mandible or other dentofacial changes. Thirty snoring and sleep apnea patients, mean age 55.3 years (SD, 8.61; range, 46.5 to 79.8 years), referred from the Ear, Nose, and Throat Department, were treated with an acrylic splint with full tooth coverage that advanced the mandible 5 to 8 mm (70% of maximal protrusion) and used 5 mm opening vertically. The splint was used 6 to 8 hours per night and 5 to 7 nights per week. Two lateral head radiographs were taken in centric occlusion, 1 before and 1 after 2 years of treatment. A small but statistically significant forward and downward change in mandibular position was found after treatment; mean was 0.4 mm (SD, 0.53; range, 0.0 to 2.0 mm; P <.001) and 0.3 mm (SD, 0.43; range, 0. 0 to 1.5 mm; P <.001), respectively. The forward and downward movement of the mandible was accomplished by a statistically significant increase in mandibular length-mean was 0.4 mm (SD, 0.62; range, 0.0 to 2.5 mm; P <.01)-and a significant decrease in overjet (P <.001) and overbite (P <.05). However, none of the patients reported any permanent sense of altered occlusion, and the anteroposterior distance between habitual occlusion (intercuspal position) and centric relation (retruded position) did not exceed 1. 0 mm in any of the patients either before or after the treatment. The change in mandibular position might be a result of a condylar and/or glenoid fossa remodeling or condylar position changes within the fossa as a compensatory reaction to the advancement of the mandible (bite jumping). However, to visualize and analyze such possible changes in detail, additional studies using lateral tomography of the temporomandibular joints or magnetic resonance imaging are required. Furthermore, because the treatment of snoring and OSAS patients is considered to be lifelong, long-term studies are needed to analyze if the small change in mandibular position will continue with further treatment."

Results indicated that vision affects the deterministic structure (in degree and complexity) of COP motions and that differential optical flow structure (radial versus lamellar flow) induced by spontaneous sway under different head orientations affects COP nonstationarity. Implications of these findings and the sensitivity of RQA to subtle time-evolutionary properties of the COP are discussed."

  "title": "Does the coordination between posture and movement during human whole-body reaching ensure center of mass stabilization?",
  "date": "1999 Nov",
  "abstract": "The whole-body center of mass (CoM) has been classically regarded as the stabilized reference value for human voluntary movements executed upon a fixed base of support. Axial synergies (opposing displacements of head and trunk with hip segments) are believed to minimize antero-posterior (A/P) CoM displacements during forward trunk movements. It is also widely accepted that anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) create forces of inertia that counteract disturbances arising from the moving segment(s). In the present study, we investigated CoM stabilization by axial synergies and APAs during a whole-body reaching task. Subjects reached towards an object placed on the ground in front of them in their sagittal plane using a strategy of coordinated trunk, knee, and hip flexion. The reaching task imposed constraints on arm-trajectory formation and equilibrium maintenance. To manipulate equilibrium constraints, differing conditions of distance and speed were imposed. The comparison of distance conditions suggested that axial synergies were not entirely devoted to CoM stabilization: backward A/P hip displacements reduced as head and trunk forward A/P displacements increased. Analysis of upper- and lower-body centers of mass in relation to the CoM also showed no strict minimization of A/P CoM displacements. Mechanical analysis of the effects of APAs revealed that, rather than acting to stabilize the CoM, APAs created necessary conditions for forward CoM displacement within the base of support in each condition. The results have implications for the CoM as the primary stabilized reference for posture and movement coordination during whole-body reaching and for the central control of posture and voluntary movement."

In this study, postural control was investigated in high and low thoracic SCI people and in able-bodied controls, using a bimanual forward-reaching task. Muscle activity was recorded bilaterally from the erector spinae (ES) at level L3, T9 and T3, latissimus dorsi (LD), ascending part of the trapezius muscle (TPA), serratus anterior (SA), sternocostal head of the pectoralis major (PM) and the oblique abdominal muscles (OA) by means of surface electromyography. Sitting balance was monitored by measuring the changes in the location of the centre of pressure (CP) using a force platform. Muscle activity analyzed in different phases of the movement showed that SCI people adopt different postural adjustments to face the balance changes due to the reaching movement. SCI people make alternative use of non-postural muscles like the LD and TPA to maintain their sitting balance."

There were significant sex differences in craniocervical angulations and these were abnormal in two thirds of subjects studies. The Forward Head Position is characterized by a cervical compensation with head inclination. This abnormal postural position showed a dolichofacial growth and an alteration of hyoid angle.\nConclusions: The craniocervical position appeared to be related to a vertical craniofacial growth pattern."

  "date": "1999 Jun",
  "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of head posture on mandibular habitual closing movement. Ten healthy subjects were examined. Head posture was evaluated as a sagittally viewed inclination of the head, and was changed from 25 degrees forward bending up to 30 degrees backward bending in 5 degrees increments. The mandibular opening and closing movement was measured at each head posture. As the head bended forward, the closing path approached the maximum intercuspal position from the anterior region, and as the head was bent backward, the closing path approached the maximum intercuspal position from the posterior region. However, the limit of this relationship was found when the head was bent forward to some extent. There was also a correlation between the head posture and the stability of the closing movement. The forward bending of the head decreased the stability of the closing path, and conversely, the backward bending increased the stability of the closing path. It was concluded that the head posture affects the direction and stability of the mandibular closing movement. Possible underlying reasons for these findings are masticatory muscle activity and the tension and resistance of inframandibular soft tissue varying with the change of head posture."

  "title": "Canal and otolith afferent activity underlying eye velocity responses to pitching while rotating",
  "date": "1999 May 28",
  "abstract": "Pitching the head while rotating (PWR) combines periodic activation of the semicircular canals and the otoliths to generate pitch and roll eye deviations and continuous horizontal nystagmus. Monkeys were tested after individual pairs of semicircular canals were plugged and single units were recorded in the vestibular nerve while the animals were sinusoidally pitched 20-40 deg about a spatial horizontal axis with 5- and 16-s periods and simultaneously rotated about a spatial vertical axis at 30-120 deg/s. As previously shown, the steady-state horizontal response disappeared after plugging the vertical semicircular canals, but was maintained when the lateral canals were plugged. When the left anterior and right posterior canal (LARP) pair was left intact, the steady-state response depended on the axis about which the pitching took place. When the axis was normal to the LARP plane, there was no steady-state response. When the pitching axis was perpendicular to the LARP normal, the response was maximal. Firing rates of otolith units were approximately in phase with pitch position, and the addition of rotation about a vertical axis did not change the response. Lateral canal units did not have a steady-state modulation during pitch or constant velocity rotation. During PWR, they oscillated at twice the pitch frequency. This corresponded to the frequency at which the canal was maximally activated as it aligned with the plane of rotation. The amplitude of modulation increased proportionally to rotational velocity, but the phase remained the same. These characteristics were unchanged during roll while rotating (RWR), which induces little continuous nystagmus. Anterior and posterior canal units were maximally excited near pitch-velocity maxima and minima, respectively, during pure pitching. During PWR, however, the phases of both components simultaneously shifted toward each other and toward being in phase with otolith units. The peak excitation tended toward a forward-pitch position when the rotation was to the ipsilateral side, and toward a backward pitch position when the rotation was to the contralateral side. With 120-deg/s rotation during a 16-s pitch period, the phase difference between anterior and posterior canal units was as small as 17 deg. These data support the postulate that the correlation between vertical canal and otolith units is the critical factor in generating continuous unidirectional horizontal nystagmus during PWR."

  "abstract": "The purpose of the present experiment was to investigate the extent to which subjects can perceive, at very slow velocities, an angular rotation of the support surface about the medio-lateral axis of the ankle, knee, hip, or neck joint when visual cues are not available. Subjects were passively displaced on a slowly rotating platform at .01, .03, and .05 deg/sec. The subjects' task was to detect movements of the platform in four different postural conditions allowing body oscillations about the ankle, knee, hip, or neck joint. In Experiment 1, subjects had to detect backward and forward rotation (pitching). In Experiment 2, they had to detect left and right rotations of the platform (rolling). In Experiment 3, subjects had to detect both backward/forward and left/right rotations of the platform, with the body fixed and the head either fixed or free to move. Overall, when the body was free to oscillate about the ankle, knee, or hip joints, a similar threshold for movement perception was observed. This threshold was lower for rolling than for pitching. Interestingly, in these postural conditions, an unconscious compensation in the direction opposite to the platform rotation was observed on most trials. The threshold for movement perception was much higher when the head was the only segment free to oscillate about the neck joint. These results suggest that, in static conditions, the otoliths are poor detectors of the direction of gravity forces. They also suggest that accurate perception of body orientation is improved when proprioceptive information can be dynamically integrated."

  "title": "Cardiovascular responses elicited by linear acceleration in humans",
  "date": "1999 Apr",
  "abstract": "Although activation of otolith receptors is known to elicit cardiovascular responses in animals, it is unclear whether vestibular stimulation can evoke changes in blood pressure and heart rate (which are independent of motion sickness) in humans. In the present study, ten normal subjects and three patients with profound bilateral reduction in vestibular function, who were seated upright with the torso aligned with the gravitation vector, were subjected to fore, aft, or lateral linear acceleration (approximately 0.2 g, attaining approximately 2 m/s in 900 ms, and decelerating for 3 s at 0.07 g). The head was fixed in the upright position, pitched maximally downward (chin on chest) or maximally backward (approximately 40-50 degrees) during the accelerations. In normal subjects, all directions of linear acceleration produced an average increase in systolic blood pressure of approximately 7-9 mm Hg and a rapid decrease in the interval between R-waves of the electrocardiogram of 14-27 ms; these responses persisted for only a few seconds. In contrast, the cardiovascular responses in patients with vestibular dysfunction were much smaller (e.g., the maximal pressor response to forward linear acceleration was <4 mm Hg). Head position during accelerations had little effect on the cardiovascular responses that were elicited in the population of normal subjects. However, although the population response was similar across directions of acceleration and head positions, many individuals exhibited larger cardiovascular changes during some stimulus conditions than during others. These data suggest that vestibular stimulation during linear accelerations can produce cardiovascular responses in humans and support the hypothesis that the vestibular system contributes to maintaining stable blood pressure during movement and changes in posture."

  "date": "1999 Feb",
  "abstract": "Study design: A within-subjects repeated measures design.\nObjectives: To determine differences in the amount of vertical opening of the mandible among 3 different head positions.\nBackground: Results from several studies have suggested that the position of the head and neck may affect temporomandibular joint function. Presently no standardized position of the head and neck has been recommended for measuring vertical opening of the mandible.\nMethods and measures: Twenty males and 20 females (32.9 +/- 8.3 years) participated in the study. We obtained 3 measurements of vertical mandibular opening using a millimeter ruler on each subject in the forward, neutral, and retracted head positions.\nResults: A 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by pairwise comparisons indicated that the vertical mandibular opening was significantly greater in the forward head position (44 +/- 5.3 mm) than in the neutral head position (41.5 +/- 4.8 mm) and in the retracted head position (36.2 +/- 4.5 mm). In addition, vertical mandibular opening was significantly greater in the neutral head position than in the retracted head position. Interclass correlation coefficients for the 3 head positions ranged from 0.90 to 0.97 for intrarater, interrater, and day-to-day reliability.\nConclusions: Head position is an important factor in determining the amount of vertical mandibular opening in healthy adults."

  "title": "Postural responses to vibration of neck muscles in patients with uni- and bilateral vestibular loss",
  "date": "1998 May 1",
  "abstract": "Postural responses to vibration applied unilaterally to the dorsal neck muscles were recorded with a sway platform in 11 patients with bilateral vestibular loss (BLD), 13 patients with unilateral vestibular lesions (ULD) and 19 normal subjects. In the normals, the vibration induced a forward postural deviation. Vibration failed to induce postural sway in the BLD patients but induced a backwards head movement in 7 patients. In the ULD patients, vibration contralateral to the lesion induced normal forward sway, whereas ipsilateral vibration resulted in sway directed to the side of the lesion and backwards. The findings demonstrate the importance of concurrent vestibular signals in determining the behavioural response to neck afferent input. We propose that in normal subjects the intact vestibular signal gives no confirmation that a head movement has occurred so it is assumed that the lower body has tilted forwards which provokes a compensatory sway. In the total absence of vestibular function the neck signal may represent a real head movement so the preferential response is a head tilt to restore upright posture. The vestibular imbalance in the ULD patients is roughly equivalent to the asymmetrical signals obtained in a normal subject during head rotation to the intact side. The stretch signal induced by ipsi-lesional vibration confirms possible head rotation, thus provoking a compensatory postural sway. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved"

  "date": "1999 Mar",
  "abstract": "Behavioural sleep during the first 2 weeks of life was investigated in female chicks reared with an imprinting object or in social (visual) isolation. Binocular sleep tended to decrease and monocular sleep to increase with age in both rearing conditions. In chicks reared with an imprinted object. during the first week, monocular sleep with either right or left eye closure occurred with approximately the same frequency, except that on day 5 in which right eye closure dominated; during the second week, however, there was a clear bias towards more monocular sleep with left eye closure. During the second week, the pattern of monocular sleep was similar in both rearing conditions, but during the first week chicks reared with the imprinting object showed relatively more right eye closure compared to chicks reared without the imprinting object, an effect that might tentatively be associated with consolidation of imprinting memories in the left hemisphere. Binocular sleep occurred in all four body postures adopted by chicks during sleep: standing sleep, sleep with bill forward, sleep with bill on the ground, and sleep with head on the ground. Monocular sleep, in contrast, only occurred when chicks adopted the bill forward posture. When the colour of the imprinting object was suddenly changed on day 8, a striking shift towards predominant right eye closure during monocular sleep was observed. The same occurred when the imprinting object was suddenly removed from the home-cage on day 8, but not with other types of changes (i.e., when a novel different object was inserted into the home-cage or when a novel-coloured imprinting object was inserted into the home-cage together with the original one). It is argued that this phenomenon could be associated with right hemisphere involvement in response to novelty."

  "title": "The effects of stochastic galvanic vestibular stimulation on human postural sway",
  "date": "1999 Feb",
  "abstract": "Galvanic vestibular stimulation serves to modulate the continuous firing level of the peripheral vestibular afferents. It has been shown that the application of sinusoidally varying, bipolar galvanic currents to the vestibular system can lead to sinusoidally varying postural sway. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that stochastic galvanic vestibular stimulation can lead to coherent stochastic postural sway. Bipolar binaural stochastic galvanic vestibular stimulation was applied to nine healthy young subjects. Three different stochastic vestibular stimulation signals, each with a different frequency content (0-1 Hz, 1-2 Hz, and 0-2 Hz), were used. The stimulation level (range 0.4-1.5 mA, peak to peak) was determined on an individual basis. Twenty 60-s trials were conducted on each subject - 15 stimulation trials (5 trials with each stimulation signal) and 5 control (no stimulation) trials. During the trials, subjects stood in a relaxed, upright position with their head facing forward. Postural sway was evaluated by using a force platform to measure the displacements of the center of pressure (COP) under each subject's feet. Cross-spectral measures were used to quantify the relationship between the applied stimulus and the resulting COP time series. We found significant coherency between the stochastic vestibular stimulation signal and the resulting mediolateral COP time series in the majority of trials in 8 of the 9 subjects tested. The coherency results for each stimulation signal were reproducible from trial to trial, and the highest degree of coherency was found for the 1- to 2-Hz stochastic vestibular stimulation signal. In general, for the nine subjects tested, we did not find consistent significant coherency between the stochastic vestibular stimulation signals and the anteroposterior COP time series. This work demonstrates that, in subjects who are facing forward, bipolar binaural stochastic galvanic stimulation of the vestibular system leads to coherent stochastic mediolateral postural sway, but it does not lead to coherent stochastic anteroposterior postural sway. Our finding that the coherency was highest for the 1- to 2-Hz stochastic vestibular stimulation signal may be due to the intrinsic dynamics of the quasi-static postural control system. In particular, it may result from the effects of the vestibular stimulus simply being superimposed upon the quiet-standing COP displacements. By utilizing stochastic stimulation signals, we ensured that the subjects could not predict a change in the vestibular stimulus. Thus, our findings indicate that subjects can act as \"responders\" to galvanic vestibular stimulation."

  "title": "Cervical root compression monitoring by flexor carpi radialis H-reflex in healthy subjects",
  "date": "1999 Jan 15",
  "abstract": "Study design: One-group, pretest-postest experimental research with repeated measures.\nObjective: To determine the effect of head postural modification on the flexor carpi radialis H-reflex in healthy subjects.\nSummary of background data: H-reflex testing has been reported to be useful in evaluating and treating patients with lumbosacral and cervical radiculopathy. The idea behind this technique is that postural modification can cause further H-reflex inhibition, indicating more compression of the impinged nerve root, or recovery, indicating decompression of the root. Such assumptions cannot be supported unless the influence of normal head postural modification on the H-reflex in healthy subjects is studied.\nMethods: Twenty-two healthy subjects participated in this study (14 men, 8 women; mean age, 39 +/- 9 years). The median nerve of the subjects at the cubital fossa was electrically stimulated (0.5 msec; 0.2 pulses per second [pps] at H-max), whereas the flexor carpi radialis muscle H-reflex was recorded by electromyography. The H-reflexes were recorded after the subject randomly maintained the end range of head-forward flexion, backward extension, rotation to the right and the left, lateral bending to the right and the left, retraction and protraction. These were compared with the H-reflex recorded during comfortable neutral positions. Data were recorded after the subject maintained the position for 30 seconds, to avoid the effect of dynamic postural modification on the H-reflex. Four traces were recorded in each position. During recording, the H-reflex was monitored by the M-response to avoid any changes in the stimulation-recording condition.\nResults: Repeated multivariate analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of the difference among the H-reflex, amplitude, and latency, in various head positions. The H-reflex amplitude showed statistically significant changes (P < 0.001) with head postural modification. All head positions, except flexion, facilitated the H-reflex. Extension, lateral bending, and rotation toward the side of the recording produced higher reflex facilitation than the other positions. These results indicate that H-reflex changes may be caused by spinal root compression-decompression mechanisms. It may also indicate that relative spinal root decompression occurs in most head-neck postures except forward flexion.\nConclusions: Head postural modification significantly influences the H-reflex amplitude but not the latency. This indicates that the H-reflex is a more sensitive predictor of normal physiologic changes than are latencies. The H-reflex modulation in various head positions may be-caused by relative spinal root compression-decompression mechanisms."

  "title": "[Contemporary postural and segmental modification of forced voice]",
  "date": "1998",
  "abstract": "The forced voice corresponds with increased peri-laryngeal tension during phonation caused by inappropriate muscle action. It is usually accompanied by a characteristic posture (the face thrust forwards, tension in the neck muscles etc...). This posture may cause dysfunction of the cords themselves, leading to dysphonia, and perhaps requiring laryngeal microsurgery. Our project aimed to put forward and validate a system of objective, non-invasive measurements of the postural features of the forced voice, in order to improve the management of these patients. The study was prospective, comparing a control group with no previous vocal problems with a group of patients with problems of laryngeal dysfunction. We carried out a number of simultaneous measurements of postural and segmental activity during phonation, using in parallel an accelerometer, a method of cine-analysis, and a postural platform. Recordings were made during phonation, but only analysed during the resting phase. It turned out that the speed of displacement of the centre of gravity was the most useful discriminating factor. The mean value was 0.07 (displacement type 0.126) for the control group, and 0.32 (displacement type 0.211) for the patient group. The discrimination between these two groups was significant (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). The reliability of this measurement allows us to envisage the inclusion into the clinical investigation package of measurements of the postural and segmental changes in the forced voice."

She had sustained a trauma 5 years previously, causing the inability to look forward or to open the jaw adequately. An examination demonstrated fixed flexion and rotation of the cervical spine, with no neurological deficit. Radiologically, there was fusion of C1, C2, and the clivus.\nTechnique: The upper cervical vertebrae were exposed via a midline posterior incision, the posterior arch of C1 was excised, and the vertebral arteries were mobilized. A wedge osteotomy was performed through the lateral masses of C1 and subsequently through the odontoid. The head was repositioned, and C1-C2 lateral mass screws and a Ransford loop were inserted.\nConclusion: It is possible to gain sufficient surgical access to the odontoid process via a posterior approach. The technique described is of benefit when the alternative anterior approaches to the upper cervical spine are technically difficult or impossible."

  "title": "A modified crash brace position for aircraft passengers",
  "date": "1998 Oct",
  "abstract": "Background: In 1989, a Boeing 737-400 aircraft crashed at Kegworth, near Nottingham, England. The survivors suffered a large number of pelvic and lower limb injuries, and approximately one-third of the passengers died. Subsequent research has suggested that the \"brace-for-impact\" position that passengers are advised to adopt prior to a crash landing might be modified in order to reduce the incidence of such injuries. The aim of this research was to evaluate biomechanically such a modified crash brace position.\nHypothesis: A modified brace position would help to prevent injuries to some passengers in the event of an impact aircraft accident.\nMethods: Impact testing on forward-facing seats was performed at the Royal Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine, Farnborough, England. Aircraft seats, mounted on a sled, were propelled down a track to impact at -16 Gx. A test dummy was used as the experimental model. Four dummy positions were investigated: a) upper torso braced forward and lower legs inclined slightly rearward of the vertical; b) upper torso braced forward and lower legs inclined forward; c) upper torso upright and lower legs inclined slightly rearward of the vertical; and d) upper torso upright and lower legs inclined forward. The impact pulses used were based on Federal Aviation Administration guidelines. Transducers located in the head, spine, and lower limbs of the dummy recorded the forces to which each body segment was exposed during the impact. These forces were compared for each brace position.\nResults: Impact testing revealed that the risk of a head injury as defined by the head injury criterion was greater in the upright position than in the braced forward position. The risk of injury to the lower limbs was dependent in part on the flailing behavior of the limbs. Flailing did not occur when the dummy was placed in a braced, legs-back position.\nConclusions: A modified brace position would involve passengers sitting with the upper torso inclined forward so that the passenger's head rested against the structure in front, if possible. The legs would be positioned with the feet resting on the floor in a position slightly behind the knee. The position differs from those previously recommended in that the feet are positioned behind the knee. This study suggests that such a position would reduce the potential for head and lower limb injury in some passengers, given that only a single seat type and single size of occupant have been evaluated. Standardization to such a position would improve passenger understanding and compliance. Such a recommendation should not obscure the fact that an occupant seated in a forward-facing aircraft seat, restrained only by a lap belt, is exposed to considerable forces during an impact accident. Such forces are capable of producing injuries in the femur, pelvis, and lumbar spine."

  "date": "1998 Jun",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to describe the kinematics of normal knees in vivo, assessed in deep flexion, using bi-planar radiographs. Antero-posterior and lateral views were obtained from five healthy males during three sequential positions of kneeling. In the first position, the subject knelt with the knees fully flexed (deep flexion between 150 and 165 degrees) and torso upright. In the second position, the subject bowed forward to an intermediate position (about 120 degrees of knee flexion). In the third position, the subject bowed further until his head touched the floor, supporting the upper torso with hands and with the knees flexed at about 90 degrees. The results show that past 135 degrees of knee flexion, the patella cleared the femoral groove and was in contact only with the condyles. For these particular postures, and during deep flexion, motion of the femur on the tibia did not reveal the classical femoral 'roll back'. Rather the lateral femoral condyle rolled further over the postero medial aspect of the lateral tibial plateau while contact of the medial femoral condyle occurred more anteriorly, but still in the posterior part of the medial plateau. This asymmetric rolling motion indicated an element of internal tibial rotation. Furthermore, the tibia was found to articulate with the femur at the most proximal points of the condyles in deep flexion. These data on the kinematics and contact characteristics of the tibio-femoral joint must be considered in any approach to design for a Deep Flexion Knee Implant."

Cervical spine posture was quantified by the angle of a reference line, composed of reference points of the upper six cervical vertebrae, with the horizontal axis. The curvature of the cervical spine was classified visually as lordotic, straight or reversed.\nResults: A relationship was found between posture and curvature of the cervical spine (p = .006); a more forward posture of the cervical spine was related to a partly reversed curvature; and a more upright posture was related to a lordotic curvature. Moreover, men more often exhibited a straight curvature, and women more often exhibited a partly reversed curvature.\nConclusion: The curvature of the cervical spine is related to the subject's posture and gender."

Various sizes of PC-FPDs can now be seen in the occupational setting as an alternative to the desktop computers. However, the increasing popularity of this relatively new technology may not be without any accompanying problems. The present study was designed to evaluate the use of PC-FPDs in terms of postural changes, muscle load, subjective complaints and performance of the subjects. Ten subjects, 5 males and 5 females, were asked to perform a text-entry task for 5 minutes using each of the 5 types of personal computers--1 desktop and 4 PC-FPDs of various sizes. Results showed that the posture assumed by the subjects while using the PC-FPDs was significantly more constrained than that assumed during work with the desktop computer. Viewing and neck angles progressively lowered and the trunk became more forward inclined. The EMG results also revealed that the activities of the neck extensor in PC-FPDs were significantly higher than in the desktop computers. Trends of increasing discomfort and difficulty of keying with the use of smaller PC-FPDs were noted. Performance was significantly lower for smaller PC-FPDs. This study shows that PC-FPDs have ergonomic attributes different from the desktop computer. An ergonomic guideline specific for PC-FPDs users is needed to prevent the surge in health disorders previously seen among desktop computer users."

  "date": "1998 Apr",
  "abstract": "Enlarged tonsils, adenoids, and chronic respiratory problems have been associated with the compensatory adaptations of natural head posture (NHP) in children. Recently, it has been shown that adult patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) also tend to exhibit a craniocervical extension (CCE) with a forward head posture (FHP). This study was designed to search for some characteristics of OSA patients that may be related to these adaptive changes in NHP. Overnight polysomnographic, demographic, and cephalometric records of 252 adult male subjects with various types of skeletal patterns and dental conditions were examined. Apnoea Index (AI) and Apnoea + Hypopnoea Index (AHI) variables were assessed to separate the non-apnoeic snorers (n = 35), and mild (n = 101), moderate (n = 63), and severe (n = 53) OSA groups. Results of the Tukey tests revealed that severe OSA patients had a greater tendency to exhibit a CCE with a FHP (P < or = 0.05 to P < or = 0.001). Differences in head extension (NSL.VER) between groups could not be identified. Pearson's 'r' correlation coefficients revealed that the CCE and FHP in OSA patients were associated with a higher disease severity, a longer and larger tongue, a lower hyoid bone position in relation to the mandibular plane, a smaller nasopharyngeal and a larger hypopharyngeal cross-sectional area, and a higher body mass index (P < or = 0.05 to P < or = 0.001). It is concluded that a CCE with a FHP is more likely to be seen in severe and obese OSA patients with certain morphological characteristics of the upper airway and related structures."

We investigated whole-body posture and its relationship to center-of-gravity (COG) stability.\nSubjects: Data from 27 subjects with vestibular hypofunction and 26 subjects without vestibular impairment were analyzed.\nMethod: An optoelectronic full-body system measured kinematics. Force plates measured ground reaction forces while subjects stood with their feet 30 cm apart and eyes open and with their feet together and eyes closed.\nResults: The subjects with vestibular hypofunction demonstrated less stability than the subjects without impairment, but there were no postural differences. Subjects with vestibular hypofunction had more weight on the left lower extremity during standing with feet apart. In all subjects in both groups, during standing with feet apart, the COG was anterior to the ankle, knee, back, and shoulder and posterior to the hip and neck. Subjects had an anterior pelvic tilt, extended trunk and head, right laterally flexed trunk and pelvis, and flexed knees. With their feet together, subjects increased their anterior pelvic tilt; trunk, head, and knee flexion; and anterior COG position.\nConclusion and discussion: Posture and stability had a low correlation. Subjects with bilateral vestibular hypofunction did not demonstrate a forward head or backward trunk lean, as has been reported anecdotally. Changing from standing with feet apart to feet together increased whole-body movement patterns to control standing stability."

  "date": "1998 Mar 27",
  "abstract": "We investigated the possibility of obtaining an anteroposterior body response to galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) by applying an equivalent stimulus to both sides of the vestibular apparatus. An original 'double fronto-mastoidal' stimulation was used on eight subjects standing with their head facing forwards. Both the onset and the cut-off of the current did induce an anteroposterior body tilt, without any lateral component. The amplitude of the tilt increased as a function of stimulus intensity. GVS evokes anteroposterior or lateral sway of similar spatio-temporal features according to the stimulation configuration. We suggest that the central nervous system makes use of the discrepancy between the left and right vestibular activity to orientate the response: equivalent afferent flows would result in an anteroposterior body response whereas lateral sway is obtained with discrepant ones."

  "abstract": "A set of experimental studies showing how inter-segmental coordination develops during childhood in various locomotor tasks is reviewed. On the basis of these results and two functional principles (stable reference frame and control of the degrees of freedom of the body joints), we recently proposed an ontogenetic model for the sensorimotor organization of balance control in humans (5). In this model, the hypothesis was put forward that the two main modes of equilibrium control (ascending vs descending temporal organization) operate alternatively and are associated with either of two modes of head-trunk linkage ('en bloc' vs articulated) during four successive periods in the course of ontogenesis. The advantage of this model is that it is heuristic and therefore open to further improvements, including the generalization of these balance strategies to most of the posturo-kinetic activities, the comparison between unperturbed natural balance and reactions to postural disturbances. Some improvements are suggested, and are illustrated by the studies of intersegmental coordination in new experimental tasks such as hops using one foot or two feet and the initiation of gait. These new results are consistent with the idea that mastery of the degrees of freedom to be controlled simultaneously during the movement improves gradually with age. Moreover, they support the concept of multiple reference frames which operate in a complementary manner or in concert to permit the most appropriate organization of balance control, depending on the environmental requirements."

  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to demonstrate, if possible, vestibulospinal reflex responses in soleus using a stimulus known to be capable of exciting vestibular afferents, namely 100-dB (NHL) clicks. We were able to show short-latency electromyographic (EMG) responses after clicks in five of eight normal subjects, and then we compared these responses with those after transmastoid galvanic stimulation (12 normal subjects). Stimulation of the side towards which the head was rotated (i.e. the side facing backwards) with either clicks or the cathode (anode applied to the opposite side) gave an initial excitatory response in soleus, while click or cathodal stimulation of the opposite side (i.e. the side facing forwards) gave an initial inhibitory response. Onset latencies and modulation with changes in postural task were identical for both click- and galvanic-evoked responses. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the amplitudes of the responses in soleus after click and galvanic stimulation (R2=0.72). These similarities suggest that the earliest reflex responses in soleus after clicks and galvanic stimulation may be mediated by a common central pathway. In contrast, there was no correlation between the amplitudes of responses evoked by 100-dB clicks in soleus and those evoked by the same stimulus in the sternocleidomastoid. We conclude that vestibular activation by clicks can evoke reflex responses in lower-limb muscles and these responses have similar characteristics to the earliest responses evoked by galvanic vestibular stimulation."

  "date": "1997 Dec",
  "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that during the initiation of stepping elicited by hypothalamic stimulation, hindlimb extension was coordinated with head extension in the sagittal plane. Chronic stimulation electrodes (monopolar stainless-steel, 125 microm diameter) were implanted bilaterally into the perifornical hypothalamus of anaesthetized rats (N = 15) under stereotaxic control. Under freely moving and awake conditions, 18 sites which reliably elicited forward locomotion at a latency of approximately 3 s were tested in a videotaping session. The locomotor stimulation was a constant current train of 5 s duration composed of biphasic pulses at 40-50 Hz. The videotape records were digitized at a sampling rate of 6 Hz for seven points on the rat: Nose, pinnae, midpoint of inter-pinnae line, right forepaw, right hindpaw and base of tail. A characteristic pattern of coordinated movements preceded, by approximately 0.5 s, the execution of the first locomotor step. The pattern included a movement of the pelvis in the anterior or superior direction that was produced by hindlimb extension and an extension of the neck forward along the sagittal plane. There was considerable flexibility in this pattern, but it was invariant to the extent that it occurred at a variety of latencies and after several types of head movements. Associated with the coordinated extensions of the neck and hindlimbs was a lowering of the head angle which had a more variable time course. These data indicate that there is significant coupling between the systems that produce hindlimb extension and control head position when the rat prepares to step."

  "title": "A short measure of balance in multiple sclerosis: validation through Rasch analysis",
  "date": "1997 Sep-Oct",
  "abstract": "Ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently present with poor balance. Neither static nor dynamic posturography explore balance during self-paced movements in real-life activities, when fall is most probable. Behavioural item-response scales can easily represent these activities. However, testing many items can easily cause fatigue in MS patients, thus distorting their scores. On the other hand, the lower the number of items, the lower the precision of the cumulative score and its reliability. A new short instrument was derived from existing ones (the Tinetti and the Berg balance scales). A preliminary 10-item version encompassed sit/stand manoeuvres, standing with eyes open and closed, standing with eyes closed and head extended, leaning forward while standing, picking up an object from floor, resisting nudges on the sternum, turning around, tandem stance. The instrument was administered 1-3 times to 55 MS patients (103 observations overall), all of them able to walk autonomously for at least 20 metres. The Rasch Analysis was adopted to explore the psychometric validity of the scale. Two items (Stand-to-sit and Standing with eyes open) were deleted, as they were too easy and thus uninformative. The remaining 8 items made up a scale (called EQUI-SCALE) complying with the requirements of unidimensionality and reliability. The item scores remained stable in a sub-sample of 24 patients tested before and after ten 1-hour exercise sessions, thus supporting the homogeneity of the items."

  "date": "1997 Nov",
  "abstract": "Impaired nasal breathing has been reported to cause changes in human head posture. The aim of this study was to assess whether there was any relationship between nasorespiratory function and variables of head posture in 58 young adults. The pressure flow technique was used to measure airflow rate and oral/nasal pressure and to calculate the smallest cross-sectional area of the nasal airway. A natural head position roentgenocephalogram was used to measure the craniovertical angulation (NSL/VER), craniocervical angulation (NSL/OPT), and cervical spine inclination (OPT/HOR). The results showed a trend toward enlarged craniocervical angulation and forward inclination of the cervical spine in subjects with a relatively large nasal cross-sectional area. Though the general opinion on the effects of reduced upper airway size on head posture is opposite, these results are an experimental confirmation of the theoretically expected mechanism that leads to increased head extension in obstructed subjects."

  "abstract": "Objective: To quantitatively describe the postural alignment of the head and shoulders and the surface curvature of the thoracic spine in comfortable erect standing and to examine the effect of age and gender on head and shoulder alignment.\nDesign: Descriptive survey.\nSetting: Gait research laboratory.\nParticipants: One hundred sixty asymptomatic volunteers aged between 17 and 83 years.\nMain outcome measures: Five photographic measurements of head and shoulder posture in the coronal and sagittal planes and a photographic measurement of the surface curvature of the thoracic spine in the sagittal plane.\nResults: Mean values of coronal head tilt, coronal shoulder angle, sagittal head tilt, sagittal C7-tragus angle, and sagittal shoulder-C7 angle were 180.1 degrees, 181 degrees, 172.1 degrees, 131.1 degrees, and 53.7 degrees, respectively. The 95% confidence intervals for the means ranged between 1 degree and 3.8 degrees. For each of the head and shoulder measurements there was no significant gender difference (p = .33 to .99). Of the five measurements, only sagittal C7-tragus angle was significantly correlated with age (r = .44), and none was correlated with surface curvature of the thoracic spine.\nConclusions: Head and shoulder posture was similar between genders. Only one postural description that has been described anecdotally was identified, i.e., that age was related to the position of the head with respect to the trunk in the sagittal plane, although the strength of the association was of questionable clinical significance. In contrast, other longstanding assumptions were not supported, and accordingly, a forward head was not associated with increased thoracic curvature or upper cervical spine extension."

  "date": "1997 Sep-Oct",
  "abstract": "Psychophysical measurements of the level at which observers set a small visual target so as to appear at eye level (VPEL) were made on 13 subjects in 1.0 g and 1.5 g environments in the Graybiel Laboratory rotating room while they viewed a pitched visual field or while in total darkness. The gravitoinertial force was parallel to the z-axis of the head and body during the measurements. The visual field consisted of two 58 degrees high, luminous, pitched-from-vertical, bilaterally symmetric, parallel lines, viewed in otherwise total darkness. The lines were horizontally separated by 53 degrees and presented at each of 7 angles of pitch ranging from 30 degrees with the top of the visual field turned away from the subject (top backward) to 30 degrees with the top turned toward the subject (top forward). At 1.5 g, VPEL changed linearly with the pitch of the 2-line stimulus and was depressed with top backward pitch and elevated with top forward pitch as had been reported previously at 1.0 g (1,2); however, the slopes of the VPEL-vs-pitch functions at 1.0 g and 1.5 g were indistinguishable. As reported previously also (3,4), the VPEL in darkness was considerably lower at 1.5 g than at 1.0 g; however, although the y-intercept of the VPEL-vs-pitch function in the presence of the 2-line visual field (visual field erect) was also lower at 1.5 g than at 1.0 g as it was in darkness, the G-related difference was significantly attenuated by the presence of the visual field. The quantitative characteristics of the results are consistent with a model in which VPEL is treated as a consequence of an algebraic weighted average or a vector sum of visual and nonvisual influences although the two combining rules lead to fits that are equally good."

  "date": "1997 Sep",
  "abstract": "The canalithiasis hypothesis proposes that benign positional vertigo (BPV) is caused by dislodged otoconia that settle in the posterior semicircular canal (PSC). When head position is changed these particles move within the canal and induce abnormal endolymph flow. To clear the PSC from debris we developed a procedure that consists of a full circle of backward head rotation in the exact plane of the canal. Patients were seated in a three-dimensional motion device that rotated in steps of 110 degrees every 30 seconds. The first part of the study was conducted as an open trial; the second part followed a single-blinded, placebo-controlled design: Forward rotation (placebo) was applied first and backward rotation was applied 1 week later if BPV persisted. All patients were assessed with a symptom diary and, in the controlled trial, also with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. In the open study 10 of 15 patients became asymptomatic after one treatment session. In the controlled trial all 15 patients remained symptomatic after forward rotation while 10 of 14 undergoing backward rotation were relieved from positional vertigo immediately (p = 0.004). The presence of secondary nystagmus during the procedure indicated a favorable outcome. Our findings provide evidence for the efficacy of canal-clearing procedures that validate the canalithiasis hypothesis of BPV."

  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the increase in the occlusal vertical dimension by means of an orthodontic appliance on craniocervical relationships and position of the cervical spine. Thirty children presenting malocclusion were divided into two groups of 15 (a study and a control group). Those in the study group wore an orthodontic appliance to correct cross-bite. The children in the control group had no treatment during the experimental period. Two lateral craniocervical radiographs were taken for each child. The first one was taken in the intercuspal position in both groups. The second radiograph was taken of the study group after four months of wearing the appliance and also of the control group after four months. Cephalometric analysis in the study group showed a significant forward cervical spine position. There were no significant changes in the control group. The changes found in the study group suggest that when there are signs and symptoms of cervical dysfunction in children undergoing long-term orthodontic treatment, it is necessary to make an evaluation of the cervical column position after the insertion of any orthodontic appliance which increases the occlusal vertical dimension."

For analysis, we recorded 51 seizures in 1 patient and 18 seizures in the other. The extent of AEDA ranged from collapsing and landing on the buttocks to head nodding only without falling.\nResults: Detailed video analysis of the drop attacks, with the patient in standing position, demonstrated the first manifestations to be flexion at the waist and knees, followed by further knee flexion, leading to falling straight down and landing on the buttocks. Ictal polygraphs demonstrated diffuse interruptions of ongoing EMG discharges corresponding to the falls, indicating that these attacks are true atonic seizures.\nConclusions: The falling manifestations of AEDA appeared to be characteristic and different from those of tonic drop seizures, which have been described as falling forward with tonic flexion of the hips, upper trunk, and head, as well as abduction or elevation of the arms."

  "title": "Neurophysiological investigations in patients with head tremor",
  "date": "1997 Jul",
  "abstract": "We studied 30 patients whose primary complaint was head tremor in an attempt to characterize neurophysiological aspects of their abnormal movement. Based on family medical history and physical examination, 23 patients had definite or probable essential tremor (essential head tremor, EHT). The remaining seven had mild dystonic signs accompanying their head tremor (head tremor plus dystonic signs, HT + DS). We recorded head movement and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the sternomastoid and splenius capitis muscles, determined the spontaneous blinking rate, and measured the excitability recovery curve of the blink reflex and of the masseteric inhibitory reflex. All patients had tremor bursts at a frequency ranging between 3 and 9 Hz in at least one of the muscles examined. The predominant pattern seen when patients were sitting relaxed and facing forward was that of synchronized EMG bursts in both splenius capitis muscles. Maintenance of extreme head postures demonstrated two types of additional abnormalities: type 1 (enhancement of tremor), which was observed in 11 patients (47.8%) with EHT and in two (28.5%) with HT + DS; and type 2 (activation of neck muscles not required for maintenance of the posture), which was observed in two patients (8.7%) with EHT and in five (71.5%) with HT + DS (chi 2 = 26.4; p < 0.001). Mean blinking rate per minute was 24.9 +/- 14.6 in patients with EHT and 42.3 +/- 10.5 in patients with HT + DS (paired t test, p = 0.001). The blink reflex and masseteric inhibitory reflex excitability recovery curves showed an abnormal interneuronal excitability enhancement in seven (30.4%) of the 23 patients with EHT and in two (28.5%) of the seven with HT + DS (chi 2 = 3.1; p > 0.05). Abnormal patterns of EMG activity of the neck muscles correlated well with the presence of mild dystonic signs. However, the analysis of brainstem interneuronal excitability did not enable recognition of those patients with head tremor who could potentially develop cervical dystonia. The enhancement of brainstem interneuronal excitability found in approximately 30% of patients with head tremor could be related to plastic changes triggered by increased activity of the cranial muscles."

  "abstract": "One hundred and twenty-one consecutive patients presenting to the Children's National Medical Center with lambdoid positional molding (LPM) were reviewed. Clinical features included unilateral occipital flattening and alopecia and forward displacement of the ipsilateral ear, forehead, and maxilla. Head tilt and tightness of the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle were common. An unexplained preponderance of LPM was found in males (74%) and on the right side (72%), both findings statistically significant (p < 0.001). Importantly, a variety of other abnormalities were seen with LPM: torticollis (41%), large head circumference (40), excess extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (35), developmental delay (19), and other CNS abnormalities (20%). Systemic problems affecting the mobility were also common. Only 3 patients had craniosynostosis, and only 2 with LPM required surgery for severe cosmetic deformities. An apparent increase in the incidence of LPM was attributed to current recommendations to keep infants supine to decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, overutilization of infant carriers similar to cradleboards of earlier cultures, and neonatal medical problems resulting in relative immobility. No evidence was found to support the concept that LPM causes compressive brain pathology; thus, surgical treatment is not required for such fears. Further, the sequelae of underlying CNS and systemic problems associated with LPM would not be corrected by opening unfused sutures, but could even be misinterpreted as complications of surgery."

  "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the impact of different methods of carrying book bags on static posture and gait kinematics of youths aged 11-13 years. Surveys identified group descriptive characteristics of subjects and book bags. Ten subjects representing the best composite of the mean characteristics of this population were filmed for both static posture and dynamic conditions of one stride length. Subjects participated in four conditions: without bag (WO), one-strap backpack (1BP), two-strap backpack (2BP), and one-strap athletic bag (ATH). Lateral spinal deviation was not significantly different between 2BP and WO. However, differences (+/-SE) were observed between 1BP (8.5 +/- 0.7 degrees) and ATH (8.3 +/- 2.4 degrees) as compared with WO (1.9 +/- 0.5 degrees). Shoulder elevation from a horizontal position showed no difference between WO and 2BP. Without bag (2.0 +/- 0.9 degrees) was different from 1BP (17.6 +/- 1.8 degrees) and ATH (15.6 +/- 2.1 degrees). 1BP was also different from 2BP (3.4 +/- 1.1 degrees). Bag carrying significantly decreased stride length (1.59 +/- 0.04 m) and increased stride frequency (57.36 +/- 1.6 cycles/min) compared to WO (1.72 +/- 0.06 m; 54.64 +/- 1.2 cycles/min, respectively), thereby reducing the support phase of the gait. One-strap bags (1BP, ATH) promoted lateral spinal bending and shoulder elevation, while the two-strap backpack significantly reduced these book bag carrying stresses. ATH promoted greater angular motion of the head and trunk as compared to backpack book bags. Carrying a backpack (1BP, 2BP) promoted significant forward lean of head and trunk compared to ATH or WO. In conclusion, the daily physical stresses associated with carrying book bags on one shoulder (1BP, ATH) significantly alters the posture and gait of youth."

  "abstract": "A previous report suggested that airway compromise without self-correction may occur in pediatric dental patients sedated with chloral hydrate (CH) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and may be interpreted as \"deep\" sedation. The purpose of this institutionally approved study was to determine 1) the association between the size of the tonsils and 2) the degree of expired carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) changes to simulated airway obstruction using the Moore head-tilt maneuver for 30 sec or less. Thirty healthy children (ASA I), aged 22-40 months, were evaluated for tonsil size and sedated with CH (50 mg/kg) and hydroxyzine (2 mg/kg) and supplemented with N2O. Pulse oximetry and capnography were used to monitor the child. During the restorative phase when the patient appeared asleep, the head was rolled forward with the chin touching the chest for a period of 30 sec. Changes in SaO2 and CO2 waveform were observed during this period. The results indicated that seven children who had enlarged tonsils had blocked airways (as determined by capnography) lasting approximately 15 sec. The remaining children did not have enlarged tonsils and continued to exchange air appropriately. O2 levels did not change during this period. The results suggest that the likelihood of airway blockage increases with enlarged tonsils. In children without airway blockage, ventilation occurs unimpeded, and attempts to readjust the head may not occur. The association between airway blockage and patient responsiveness is discussed in relation to sedation levels."

  "date": "1997 May 1",
  "abstract": "1. We have studied the effects of changes in posture on the motor response to galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). The purpose of the experiments was to investigate whether the function of the GVS-evoked response is to stabilize the body or the head in space. Subjects faced forwards with eyes closed standing with various stance widths and sitting. In all cases the GVS-evoked response consisted of a sway of the body towards the anodal ear. 2. In the first set of experiments the response was measured from changes in (i) electromyographic activity of hip and ankle muscles, (ii) the lateral ground reaction force, and (iii) lateral motion of the body at the level of the neck (C7). For all measurements the response became smaller as the feet were placed further apart. 3. In the second set of experiments we measured the GVS-evoked tilts of the head, torso and pelvis. The basic response consisted of a tilt in space (anodal ear down) of all three segments. The head tilted more than the trunk and the trunk tilted more than the pelvis producing a leaning and bending of the body towards the anodal ear. This change in posture was sustained for the duration of the stimulus. 4. The tilt of all three segments was reduced by increasing the stance width. This was due to a reduction in evoked tilt of the pelvis, the bending of the upper body remaining relatively unchanged. Changing from a standing to a sitting posture produced additional reductions in tilt by reducing the degree of upper body bending. 5. The results indicate that the response is organized to stabilize the body rather than the head in space. We suggest that GVS produces a vestibular input akin to that experienced on an inclined support surface and that the function of the response is to counter any threat to balance by keeping the centre of mass of the body within safe limits."

  "date": "1997 Apr",
  "abstract": "Vibration of the dorsal muscles of the neck, simulating lengthening, in standing man causes a visible forwards tilt of the body shown on posturography as a tonic sagittal sway deviation. According to the theory that posture is organized with respect to a 'body schema' this deviation is a result of an interpretation of the concurrent neck afferent and vestibular signals. Considering the hypothesis that neck afferent signals may be misinterpreted in patients with spasmodic torticollis (ST) causing abnormal postural responses, we recorded body sway induced by unilateral dorsal neck muscle vibration in 22 idiopathic ST patients (19 treated with botulinum toxin) during upright stance with eyes closed. Comparison groups were 19 normal subjects and 11 patients with bilateral loss of vestibular function (labyrinthine defective, LD) in whom neck afference should be intact. Both treated and untreated ST and LD patients had absent or diminished sway deviations. When sway deviation did occur, it was sagitally oriented as with normal subjects and unrelated to ST head turns. In most ST and LD patients, neck vibration induced neck extension, an effect which is observed in normal subjects only if the torso is retrained. The results suggest that neck proprioceptive input retains local postural functions in ST, however, it is relatively ignored in the context of the whole body postural control and spatial orientation. The mild disorders of vestibular function reported in torticollis patients may be due to an inability to calibrate vestibular signals by reference to corroborative signals from neck proprioception."

Measurements of viewing distance, viewing angle, head angle, neck angle and electromyogram (EMG) activities of the neck, shoulder and back muscles of visual display terminal (VDT) operators were compared at workstations using an FPD and a desktop personal computer (DPC). A notebook personal computer (NPC) with a 10.4 inches FPD, was used in this experiment. Each of 10 healthy subjects performed word processing tasks using both NPC and DPC workstations. Significant differences in the work posture while using the NPC and DPC were seen with viewing distance, viewing angle and head angle. The characteristic features of the work posture using the NPC were a remarkably short viewing distance and a forward inclination of the head. The value of integrated EMG (IEMG) of the neck muscle was greater while using the NPC than when using the DPC. These phenomena were caused by the structure of NPCs; most NPCs have a display and keyboard which cannot be separated and are not adjustable without tilt and swivel mechanisms. VDT devices that cannot be adjusted may potentially make operators assume a poor posture while working, which could cause visual and musculoskeletal disorders. To prevent visual and musculoskeletal problems using NPCs, a more upright head and neck position was recommended. The addition of a mechanism for adjustment of the height of an NPC display would allow a comfortable downward gaze without the loss of correct posture."

  "abstract": "Background: There is increasing recognition of surgeons' physical fatigue in the new ergonomic environment of laparoscopic surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine what the differences are in the movement of the surgeon's axial skeleton between laparoscopic and open operations.\nMethods: Surgeons' body positions were recorded on videotape during four laparoscopic (LAP) and six open (OP) operations. The percent of time the head and back were in a normal, bent, or twisted position as well as the number of changes in head and back position were tabulated using a computer program. A separate laboratory study was performed on four surgeons \"walking\" a 0.5-inch polyethylene tubing forward and backward using laparoscopic and open techniques. The movements of the surgeons' head, trunk, and pelvis were measured using a three-camera kinematic system (Kin). The center of pressure was recorded using a floor-mounted forceplate (Fp).\nResults: In the operating room surgeons' head and back positions were more often straight in laparoscopic procedures and more often bent in open operations. The number of changes in back position per minute were significantly decreased when the laparoscopic-only part of surgery was analyzed. In the laboratory the subjects' head position was significantly (p = 0.02) more upright and the anteroposterior (AP) and rotational range of motion of the head was significantly reduced during laparoscopy. Subjects' CP was more anterior and there was a significant reduction in the AP range of motion of the CP during laparoscopy.\nConclusions: Our study suggests that surgeons exhibit decreased mobility of the head and back and less anteroposterior weight shifting during laparoscopic manipulations despite a more upright posture. This more restricted posture during laparoscopic surgery may induce fatigue by limiting the natural changes in body posture that occur during open surgery."

  "title": "Responses to dynamic head-and-body tilts are enhanced in Parkinson's disease",
  "date": "1997 Feb",
  "abstract": "Background: Previous studies demonstrated that destabilizing responses to slow perturbations were enhanced in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Our objectives were to investigate the influence of PD on responses to faster whole head-and-body tilts in the standing position, and to establish whether any modification of tilt-evoked responses in PD patients was related to possible changes in the modulation of soleus (SO) H-reflex.\nMethods: Ten PD patients and 10 age-matched normal subjects assumed a standing position on an L-shaped tilting apparatus. Their head and shoulders were firmly attached to the back support of the apparatus, while their feet were fixated to the standing platform. With their vision occluded, the subjects's whole head-and-body was suddenly tilted forward to 20 degrees, at a peak head acceleration of 0.7 g +/- 0.1 g. Tilt-evoked responses were recorded from the lower limb muscles bilaterally. In addition, 40 H-reflexes were elicited in the SO muscle at 30-190 ms intervals after the onset of head acceleration. The M response amplitude was kept within +/- 15% of its control value.\nResults: PD patients demonstrated an abnormally high responsiveness to whole head-and-body tilts in comparison with age-matched normal subjects. This was shown by the significantly larger proportion of PD patients manifesting responses in the SO, biceps femoris and vastus lateralis muscles (p < 0.05), as well as their significantly larger SO response area (413%; p < 0.01). In contrast, the amplitude of the SO H-reflex was significantly increased by only 14% (p < 0.05) in these patients, and only at 30-70 ms after head acceleration onset.\nConclusions: The overexcitable tilt-evoked responses of PD patients could originate from a reduced ability to suppress responses when the body is supported. This enhanced excitability of tilt-evoked responses was probably not due to motoneuronal hyperexcitability or decreased presynaptic inhibition of the group Ia terminals involved in the mainly monosynaptic H-reflex pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that the control of spinal interneurons involved in the tilt-evoked responses may be defective in PD."

  "date": "1997 Jan 24",
  "abstract": "We studied the interaction between muscle responses evoked in standing by electrical stimulation (ES) of the tibial nerve and dynamic tilts of the head-and-body in 13 young healthy subjects. Subjects were attached to an L-shaped tilting apparatus and underwent sudden forward tilting of their head-and-body as a whole, without ankle rotation. During such tilts, the area of response evoked in the ipsilateral vastus lateralis (iVL) muscle by the ES was significantly increased by 74% as compared to quiet supported stance (P = 0.01). The response latency of the contralateral VL and soleus muscles i.e. the crossed extension reflex, was significantly shorter during tilt (54 +/- 22 ms) than during quiet supported stance (115 +/- 13 ms, P < 0.01). The increased excitability of extensor muscles activated by ES during tilt seems appropriate to maintain stance during a forward perturbation of the body."

  "title": "Knee kinematics in-vivo of kneeling in deep flexion examined by bi-planar radiographs",
  "date": "1997",
  "abstract": "Squatting and kneeling are important daily activities for Middle and Far East cultures that require positioning the knee in deep flexion. In these activities, the limb becomes fully flexed with a knee flexion angle reaching between 150 and 160 degrees and the heel reaching the posterior surface of the upper thigh. Existing knee prostheses do not allow a full return to normal activities for this large population since they are limited to achieving knee flexion of about 120 degrees. Also, there is very limited information on knee kinematics and/or forces in the range beyond 120 degrees. The purpose of this study is to describe the kinematics of normal knees in-vivo, assessed in deep flexion, using bi-planar radiographs. A-P and lateral views were obtained from 5 healthy subjects during three sequential positions of kneeling. In the 1st position, the subject knelt with the knees fully flexed (deep flexion between 150 degrees and 160 degrees) and torso upright. In the 2nd position, the subject bowed forward to an intermediate position (about 120 degrees of knee flexion). In the 3rd position, the subject bowed further until his/her head touched the floor, supporting the upper torso with hands and attaining a knee flexion of about 90 degrees. The results show that past 135 degrees of knee flexion, the patella was found to clear the femoral groove and was in contact only with the condyles. The results also show that the classical femoral \"roll back\" does not appear to occur in deep flexion. It seems that the lateral femoral condyle rolls over the postero medial aspect of the lateral tibial plateau while contact of the medial femoral condyle occurs more anteriorly, but still in the posterior aspect of the medial tibial plateau. This asymmetric rolling motion implies an element of internal tibial rotation. Furthermore, the tibia was found to articulate with the femur at the most proximal points of the condyles in deep flexion. These data on the kinematics and contact characteristics of the tibio-femoral joint must be considered in any approach to design for a Deep Flexion Knee Implant."

  "title": "Association of lip posture and the dimensions of the tonsils and sagittal airway with facial morphology",
  "date": "1997",
  "abstract": "The specific contribution of enlarged tonsils or adenoids to craniofacial growth remains unknown, and there is no agreement in the literature as to the significance of lip posture. This study assessed the separate associations of lip posture, sagittal airway size, and tonsil size with selected cephalometric measures. Clinical and cephalometric data of 207 children who presented for evaluation of tonsil and/or adenoid problems were evaluated. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the linear relationship between each of the three parameters and the cephalometric dependent variables. Open lip posture, reduced sagittal airway, and large tonsils were each associated statistically with a characteristic but different skeletal configuration. This association was proportional. Specifically, a more open lip posture was associated with a more backwardly rotated face and larger lower facial height. Reduced sagittal airway size was associated with en bloc backward relocation of the maxilla and mandible. Because the sella-nasion dimension shortened proportionally, the SNA and SNB angles were not affected. Larger tonsils were associated with more forward relocation and rotation of the maxilla and mandible and increased SNA and SNB angles. Because each of the three parameters was associated proportionally with a different craniofacial morphology, it is concluded that lip posture, sagittal airway size, and tonsil size represent three different and unrelated phenomena with respect to their effects on craniofacial growth and form."

  "title": "Quantifying work load in neck, shoulders and wrists in female dentists",
  "date": "1997",
  "abstract": "Objective: To assess the work load in neck and upper limbs of dentists.\nMethods: Twelve right-handed female dentists (six with and six without a history of definite neck/shoulder disorders, pair-wise matched for age) were studied when performing authentic dental work. Electromyography (EMG) was used to quantify the muscular load of the shoulders bilaterally and of the right forearm. Positions and movements of the head and wrists were measured, using inclinometers and electrogoniometers.\nResults: During work, the median load for the right upper trapezium muscle was 8.4% of the maximal voluntary EMG activity (MVE); during 90% of the time the load was > or = 3.3% MVE (\"static\" load). The figures were somewhat lower on the left side (7.0% and 2.5% MVE, respectively). Subjects with disorders had over all lower load levels for the trapezius muscles, although not statistically significant at < 0.05, than those without disorders. During a standardized reference contraction for the trapezius, the load was 17% MVE, and the quotient between MVE and torque [normalized to maximal voluntary torque (MVC)] was 0.5. These figures may be used for transformations. The muscular load on the right forearm was similar to the loads on the trapezius. The head was, on average, forward tilted > or = to 39 degrees, and during 10% of the time > or = 49 degrees. The left hand was held in more static positions, with palmar flexion and ulnar deviation, also reflected by lower angular velocities and repetitiveness, as compared with the right one, which was dorsiflexed.\nConclusions: Dentists are exposed to high load on the trapezius muscles bilaterally, and steep, prolonged forward bending of the head. Further, for the wrists the postures were constrained, but the dynamic demands were low."

  "date": "1997",
  "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by repeated obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. The purpose of this study was to test the relative contributions of specific demographic and cephalometric measurements to OSA severity. Demographic, cephalometric, and overnight polysomnographic records of 291 male OSA patients and 49 male nonapneic snorers were evaluated. A partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used for statistical evaluation. The results revealed that the predictive powers of obesity and neck size variables for OSA severity were higher than the cephalometric variables used in this study. Compared with other cephalometric characteristics, an extended and forward natural head posture, lower hyoid bone position, increased soft palate and tongue dimensions, and decreased nasopharyngeal and velopharyngeal airway dimensions had relatively higher associations with OSA severity. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was the OSA outcome variable that was best explained by the demographic and cephalometric predictor variables. We conclude that the PLS analysis can successfully summarize the correlations between a large number of variables, and that obesity, neck size, and certain cephalometric measurements may be used together to evaluate OSA severity."

  "date": "1997 Jan",
  "abstract": "Methods: To assess subjective postural orientation and the visual vertical during slow pitch tilt, subjects were seated, restrained and in darkness in a simulator. They estimated when they were tilted 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees forwards and backwards during cycles of pitching tilted at 1 degree x s-1 and at the same time set a 5-cm luminous cube, cockpit-mounted at 60 cm from the nasium, to be Earth vertical. Experimental protocols assessed the following: 1) the effect on postural estimates of seeing the cube versus darkness; 2) comparison of visual vertical settings at actual 45 degrees and 90 degrees tilts; 3) the adaptive effect of repeating estimates and settings; 4) the effect of a prolonged tilt on subsequent postural and visual vertical estimates; and 5) the comparative effect of tilting the body in alignment.\nResults: Seated, subjects' estimates of postural tilt were consistently greater than machine tilt, and similar in darkness to when seeing the cube. Overestimations increased with preceding tilts in the opposite direction, particularly when tilting from forwards whence subjects estimated they were backwards when the machine was tilted forwards. Postural estimates became more accurate with repetition but visual verticals deteriorated. Duration of conditioning tilt did not effect estimates. Visual vertical settings were largely accurate throughout. Labyrinthine defective subjects performed similarly to normals. Subjects frequently reported they felt disoriented during tilting.\nDiscussions: Seated subjects' postural estimates were 'accurate' if one assumes that the reference shifted from the head to a trunk-leg axis on backwards tilt, however, subjects were unaware of this. Postural and visual vertical estimates could have been based solely on proprioception. Shifts in reference for verticality could be a factor in misperception of attitude in air and ground vehicles when accelerating or climbing."

  "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of antero-posterior movement on the upright standing posture in the humans. Subjects were asked to stand on a platform in a linear accelerator (sled) in the dark. At a fixed distance of sled movements in an antero-posterior direction, peak speed was changed by sinusoidal modes run at 0.02 G, 0.04 G, 0.06 G and 0.08 G. At lower speeds (0.02 G and 0.04 G) joints moved in parallel, but at higher speeds (0.06 G and 0.08 G) the hip flexed or extended in the direction of the sway. At lower speeds (0.02 G and 0.04 G) EMG in lower leg exhibited co-activated patterns in both forward and backward accelerations at lower speeds (0.02 G and 0.04 G), but at higher speeds (0.06 G and 0.08 G) TA was activated with reciprocal inhibition of GC to maintain the body in equilibrium in a reflexive manner. This reciprocal inhibition may be due to main reflex control elicited by motor functions as a result of the linear acceleration. The threshold of speed was assumed to be from 0.04 G to 0.06 G for all but one subject."

  "abstract": "The present cephalometric study aimed to describe the antero-posterior diameters of the pharyngeal airway in a sample of 50 male obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients and a reference sample of 103 male students, and to examine the relationship between these diameters and the posture of the head and the cervical column. Subjects were recorded in the cephalometer standing with the head in its natural position (mirror position). Pharyngeal airway diameters were measured at seven levels ranging from the maxillary tuberosity to the vallecula of the epiglottis. The largest difference was observed at the level behind the soft palate where the diameter was 50 per cent narrower in the OSA sample than in the reference sample. Extension of the cranio-cervical angle and forward inclination of the cervical column were correlated with an increase in the three most caudal airway diameters in the OSA sample: at the uvula, the root of the tongue, and the epiglottis, but only to increase in the lowest diameter in the reference sample. The findings were considered to reflect a compensatory physiological postural mechanism that serves to maintain airway adequacy in OSA patients in the awake erect posture, most efficiently so at the lowest levels of the oropharyngeal airway."

  "title": "Effects of vestibular loss on head stabilization in response to head and body perturbations",
  "date": "1996 Nov-Dec",
  "abstract": "Control of head position during postural responses is important to facilitate both the interpretation of vestibular signals and the stabilization of gaze. In these experiments, we compared head stabilization for two different postural tasks: 1) in response to perturbations at the head, and 2) in response to perturbations induced at the support surface, which perturb both body and head position. To determine whether normal vestibular function is necessary for head stabilization in these two tasks, responses to forward and backward mechanical perturbations of the head and body were compared for 13 normal subjects and 4 patients with profound bilateral vestibular loss (two with vestibular loss in adulthood and two in infancy). Normal subjects showed little neck muscle activity for body perturbations, but large, early activations in both neck extensors and flexors for head perturbations. In contrast, vestibular patients showed excessive neck muscle activation for body perturbations and reduced or absent neck muscle activity for head perturbations. Patients with vestibular loss in adulthood also showed increased head acceleration in response to both head and body perturbations, but patients with vestibular loss in infancy showed more normal head accelerations. For body perturbations, the differences in head acceleration between patients and normals were greater for later head acceleration peaks, indicating poor head control during the execution of the postural response. Trunk angle changes were also higher in the patients for forward body perturbations, indicating that poorer control of trunk position could have contributed to their poorer head stabilization. These results indicate that the vestibular system plays an important role in head and trunk stabilization for both head and body perturbations. However, the more normal head accelerations of the patients with infant vestibular loss also indicate that other mechanisms, possibly involving neck reflexes, can at least partially substitute for the vestibular system to provide head and trunk stabilization."

  "title": "Considerations on the mechanisms of alternating skew deviation in patients with cerebellar lesions",
  "date": "1996 Nov-Dec",
  "abstract": "Alternating skew deviation, in which the side of the higher eye changes depending upon whether gaze is directed to the left or the right, is a frequent sign in patients with posterior fossa lesions, including those restricted to the cerebellum. Here we propose a mechanism for alternating skews related to the otolith-ocular responses to fore and aft pitch of the head in lateral-eyed animals. In lateral-eyed animals the expected response to a static head pitch is cyclorotation of the eyes. But if the eyes are rotated horizontally in the orbit, away from the primary position, a compensatory skew deviation should also appear. The direction of the skew would depend upon whether the eyes were directed to the right (left eye forward, right eye backward) or to the left (left eye backward, right eye forward). In contrast, for frontal-eyed animals, skew deviations are counterproductive because they create diplopia and interfere with binocular vision. We attribute the emergence of skew deviations in frontal-eyed animals in pathological conditions to 1) an imbalance in otolithocular pathways and 2) a loss of the component of ocular motor innervation that normally corrects for the differences in pulling directions and strengths of the various ocular muscles as the eyes change position in the orbit. Such a compensatory mechanism is necessary to ensure optimal binocular visual function during and after head motion. This compensatory mechanism may depend upon the cerebellum."

  "title": "Forms of forward quadrupedal locomotion. I. A comparison of posture, hindlimb kinematics, and motor patterns for normal and crouched walking",
  "date": "1996 Oct",
  "abstract": "1. Posture, hindlimb kinematics, and activity patterns of selected hindlimb muscles were compared for normal and crouched treadmill walking (0.5-0.6 m/s) for eight cats. To elicit crouched walking in which the trunk and head were lowered, cats were encouraged to walk under a light-weight Plexiglas ceiling suspended 17-20 cm above the treadmill belt. Kinematic data were obtained from high-speed ciné film, and electromyograms (EMGs)-synchronized with the kinematic records-were taken from 11 hindlimb muscles. 2. The postures for the two forms of walking were distinctly different. During crouched walking, each cat lowered its entire body keeping its trunk horizontal to the treadmill belt. Also the head was lowered, with the top of the head in line with the dorsal surface of the trunk. Hip height, used as a measure for hindlimb crouch, was reduced by 30%, from an average height of 23 cm to an average height of 16 cm above the belt during the entire step cycle. 3. Average cycle periods (766 +/- 30 ms, mean +/- SD) and percentage of time devoted to swing (30%) and stance (70%) were similar for normal and crouched walking. The profiles of the hindlimb kinematics were also similar for the hip, knee, ankle, and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints during the step cycle, but the timing of some of the motion reversal, as well as the ranges of motion during various phases, were different at some joints for the two forms of walking. 4. During the swing phase, the transition between the flexion and extension (F-E1 reversal) occurred later in the normalized swing phase at the hip, knee, and ankle joints, and the range of flexion was increased at each joint. With greater flexion at these joints, the anatomic axis of the hindlimb (measured from hip joint to toe) was decreased and the hind paw advanced in the narrow space between the abdomen and treadmill belt. At contact, the position of the paw was less anterior to the perpendicular reference line (hip joint marker to belt) and all joints were more flexed for crouched than normal walking. 5. Throughout the stance phase, the knee and ankle joints remained significantly more flexed by 41-45 deg during crouched than normal walking. Although the hip and MTP joints started in a more flexed position at paw contact, both joints extended more during stance for crouched than normal walking, and at the time of peak extension (just before paw lift-off), the degree of extension at the hip and MTP joints was similar for both forms of walking. 6. Muscle patterns for crouched and normal walking were similar with some exceptions. The burst durations for three primary flexor muscles, the semitendinosus (knee flexor), extensor digitorum longus (EDL, ankle flexor), and flexor digitorum longus (digit flexor) were longer for crouched than normal walking, and this was consistent with the increased range and duration of flexion during the swing phase of crouched walking. Also, two muscles that normally showed mainly swing-related activity during normal walking, the EDL and the extensor digitorum brevis, had distinct stance-related bursts that occurred after midstance during crouched walking. 7. Crouched walking requires a postural change that typically occurs when cats stalk prey and when cats walk up and down sleep slopes. Postural set during walking appears to be determined by brain stem and diencephalic centers, and the postural orientation of the cat may require adjustments in the motor program provided by spinal centers for the cat to walk. The role of posture and locomotion and the adjustments in hindlimb kinematics and EMG activity patterns have been studied for forward and backward walking in the cat and now for crouched walking on the treadmill. These data will assist us in understanding the role of posture, especially crouched posture, during other walking behaviors."

  "abstract": "To test the influence of head position on pulmonary function in tetraplegic individuals 15 subjects with chronic C4-C7 injuries participated in a one group pre-post test comparing the relationship between orthostatic position of the head (OPH) and standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Twelve subjects with habitual forward head posture and three with non-forward head posture performed PFTs in (1) their habitual posture, and (2) an experimental posture imposed by placement of thoracic and/or lumbar rolls behind their back. Results showed that changing head posture did not alter mid-forced expiratory flow or forced inspiratory vital capacity, but significantly affected forced vital capacity (t = 2.83; P < 0.05) and 12 s maximum voluntary ventilation (t = 2.07; P < 0.05). In cases where pulmonary function was altered by head position, the resulting performance was best in the subject's habitual posture, although no differences in resting pulmonary tests were observed between subjects with and without forward head position. These data show that temporary postural alterations affecting OPH, if not allowing sufficient time for muscular adaptation, adversely affect pulmonary function in tetraplegic patients."

  "abstract": "Background: There is little consensus regarding the most efficient or the safest method by which to place a central venous catheter (CVC).\nMethods: A single house officer prospectively evaluated 140 patients for whom he was requested to place CVCs. One hundred and eight patients participated in a randomized study of positioning. Of the 140 patients, 7 had emergency line placement; 105 randomized patients undergoing elective CVC placement form the basis for this report (power > 80% to detect change of one needle pass between groups). Patient positions were termed \"bump\" (head turned to the contralateral side and a rolled towel placed vertically between the scapulas) and \"no bump\" (head facing forward and no towel placed in the back.)\nResults: Ninety-three of 105 patients had successful catheter placement. Catheters were more often successfully introduced in the bump group than no bump group (98% versus 83%, P < 0.04). For patients with difficult CVC placement (those > 160 pounds, those with a weight-to-height ratio > 29, those with previous unsuccessful catheterization), the bump position was superior with respect to increased likelihood of venous blood return, decreased likelihood of arterial blood return, and increased likelihood of successful catheterization, although differences did not reach statistical significance (P < 0.05) in individual analyses. Of patients with successful catheterization, 97% had three or fewer needle passes. Those with more than three needle passes were less likely to have successful catheter placement (P < 0.01), were more likely to have arterial blood return (P < 0.01) and pneumothorax (P = 0.12).\nConclusions: The bump position improves the likelihood of successful central venous catheter placement. No more than three needle passes ought to be attempted."

  "date": "1996 Aug 23",
  "abstract": "To examine postural stability of the head, slow, undetectable rotations of small amplitude were imposed about a vertical axis while human subjects maintained a stationary body. Six normal subjects were used. The rotations were imposed through an elastic linkage, and lasted 4 s. The amplitude of head rotation was small, approximately 0.002 rad. The imposed perturbations commenced from an unloaded resting position with the head facing forward, under four conditions (1) relaxed, eyes closed; (2) relaxed, eyes open; (3) still, eyes closed; and (4) still, eyes open. The terms \"relaxed' and \"still' refer to the prior instructions given to the subjects regarding how they were to hold their head. There was a near linear relationship between average torque and average head angle. The effective stiffness of the head on the neck was notably low, approximately 10 Nm rad-1. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated ability to increase mean stiffness between \"relaxed' and \"still' conditions by 51% (P < 0.02). Visual input did not change mean stiffness significantly. Therefore, for the rotations to have been imperceptible, either the visual shifts involved must have been imperceptible, or the eyes must have counterrotated."

  "abstract": "Postural responses to vibration applied unilaterally to dorsal neck muscles were recorded with a sway platform in nine patients with unilateral vestibular lesions and 19 normal subjects. In normals, the vibration induced a forward postural deviation. In patients, vibration of the neck contralateral to the lesion induced normal forward sway, whereas ipsilateral vibration resulted in sway of lower amplitude than normal and predominantly in the direction of the lesion or backwards. It is suggested that the proprioceptive error signal introduced by the neck vibration combined with an asymmetrical vestibular input due to a unilateral vestibular lesion provoked an erroneous representation of head position in patients resulting in a redirection of their body sway."

  "abstract": "We evaluated the gait pattern of a deafferented subject who suffered a permanent loss of large sensory myelinated fibers below the neck following an acute episode of purely sensory neuropathy 21 years ago. The subject has developed several strategies to achieve a secure gait, namely: (1) a reduction of the degrees of freedom by freezing the knee articulations during the stance phase, (2) a preservation of body balance by enlarging his base of support, and (3) visual monitoring of his step by stabilizing the head-trunk linkage together with a characteristic forward tilt. As a result, the gait of the deafferented subject lacks the fluidity of normal gait. Compared with normal subjects, the gait pattern of the deafferented subjects is characterized by a shorter cycle length, a longer cycle duration, a slower speed, and a lower cadence. Using a dual-task paradigm, the attentional demands for walking were particularly important (as indexed by longer probe reaction times) during the double-support phase, suggesting that the deafferented subject uses the double-support phase as a transitory stable phase to update cognitively the postural features necessary for generating his next step."

  "date": "1996 Jul",
  "abstract": "Knowledge of how dental appliances alter upper airway muscle activity when they are used for the treatment of snoring and/or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is very limited. The purpose of this study was to define the effect of a tongue retaining device (TRD) on awake genioglossus (GG) muscle activity in 10 adult subjects with OSA and in 6 age and body mass index (BMI) matched symptom-free control subjects. The TRD is a custom-made appliance designed to allow the tongue to remain in a forward position between the anterior teeth by holding the tongue in an anterior bulb with negative pressure, during sleep. This pulls the tongue forward to enlarge the volume of the upper airway and to reduce upper airway resistance. In this study, two customized TRDs were used for each subject. The TRD-A did not have an anterior bulb but incorporated lingual surface electrodes to record the GG electromyographic (EMG) activity. The TRD-B contained an anterior bulb and two similar electrodes. The GG EMG activity was also recorded while patients used the TRD-B but were instructed to keep their tongue at rest outside the anterior bulb; this condition is hereafter referred to as TRD-X. The GG EMG activity and nasal airflow were simultaneously recorded while subjects used these customized TRDs during spontaneous awake breathing in both the upright and supine position. The following results were obtained and were consistent whether subjects were in the upright or the supine position. The GG EMG activity was greater with the TRD-B than with the TRD-A in control subjects (p < 0.05), whereas the GG EMG activity was less with the TRD-B than with the TRD-A in subjects with OSA (p < 0.01). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the GG EMG activity of the TRD-A and the TRD-X in control subjects, whereas there was less activity with the TRD-X than with the TRD-A in subjects with OSA (p < 0.05). On the basis of these findings, it was concluded that the TRD has different effects on the awake GG muscle activity in control subjects and patients with OSA. The resultant change in the anatomic configuration of the upper airway caused by the TRD may be important in the treatment of OSA because such a change may alleviate the impaired upper airway function."

  "abstract": "Interactions between upper airway structure and posture in relation to obesity were studied in a sample of 61 adult Class I skeletal type male patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 10 homologous control subjects. A pair of upright and supine lateral cephalometric films were taken for each subject. A Pearson correlation analysis identified significant r values for several demographic variables in patients with OSA such as apnea and hypopnea index, percentage of predicted neck circumference, minimum arterial oxygen saturation, and body mass index (BMI). The difference between cephalometric variables identified in upright and supine subjects was calculated. When patients with OSA changed their posture from upright to supine, significant correlations were observed between the cranial base to upper cervical column angle and the hypopharynx cross-sectional area and BMI. Moreover, the mandibular plane angle and the sella-nasion plane was significantly correlated with BMI. This occurred along with a significant positive correlation between the sella-nasion plane angle and BMI and a significant inverse correlation between the mandibular plane angle in reference to the absolute vertical and horizontal planes, with BMI after the positional change. Such correlations were not observed in control subjects. No correlations were observed between the variables related to the position of the hyoid bone with BMI in either patients with OSA or control subjects after the change in posture. On the basis of these findings, we propose that when patients with OSA change their body position from upright to supine (1) the patient's neck is more extended, and (2) the hyoid bone moves more anterosuperiorly in conjunction with an upward and forward rotation of the mandible. This change in craniofacial structure may be a compensatory geometrical change in the upper airway to secure its patency."

  "abstract": "To measure the effects of the pinna position on spectral sound localization cues, the head-related transfer function (HRTF) from the free-field to a point in the ear canal was measured for anesthetized cats with their pinnae in three positions: the relaxed, anesthetized position; pulled forward into an approximation of the \"alert cat\" posture; and pulled back. The general features of HRTFs are not changed by moving the pinna, although the mapping of particular HRTF features onto directions in space is changed. As an approximation, the pinna behaves like a fixed-shaped sound collector, so that HRTFs shift with the pinna when it moves; however, pinna movement changes some quantitative details of HRTFs beyond what is predicted by this approximation. When viewed as directional gain, pinna movements serve to optimize listening conditions. However, when considering sound localization, pinna movements lead to ambiguities regarding source location. If pinna position is not incorporated into the computation, and spectral cues alone are used for localization, the ambiguity is about 60 degrees in azimuth and 30 degrees in elevation. Pinna movements produce similar azimuthal ambiguity in interaural level differences. Interaural time difference cues could be used to reduce the ambiguity in azimuth, but a knowledge of pinna position seems to be necessary to resolve ambiguities in elevation."

  "title": "Effect of posture on the onset of fictive locomotion in the decerebrate rabbit preparation",
  "date": "1996 Apr 12",
  "abstract": "Spontaneous locomotor episodes were recorded from hindlimb muscle nerves of decerebrate curarized rabbit preparations. Changes in the static position of both hindfeet (from extended to flexed) or of the head (from horizontal to bent forward) were shown to elicit a shift of the first locomotor burst from flexion to extension. Interneurones whose activity was recorded in the lumbar spinal cord were active throughout the first locomotor burst only when the latter was an extensor burst. Such data show that proprioceptive inputs are able to determine the onset of central locomotor programmation. Neuronal interactions which, at the spinal level, could account for this effect, are discussed."

  "date": "1996 Mar",
  "abstract": "The aim of the work is to inspect the influence of the treatment by using hyper-correcting prisms on the vertical deviations of the eyes and on the head's position in persons with nystagmus. We observed 4 persons with nystagmus without strabismus and 3 persons with convergent squint. In persons without strabismus the prismatic correction placed with an edge in the direction of the \"calm's zone\" (quiet's zone) to obtain the straight position of the head when looking forwards was applied. Twice a day during 10 minutes the patients were making the movement's exercises in the vertical and horizontal direction looking by the prism separately by each eye. This prism (often 35 D prism) was placed with the edge in the direction of greater deviation of the oblique inferior muscles and the left rectus inferior muscle. Patients with convergent strabismus were treated according to the principles of localization method with consideration of the localize exercises by using hyper-correcting prisms in the vertical and horizontal directions. Two patients had a surgery in order to eliminate not aesthetic and strong prisms which were applied because of large horizontal squint. One patient with convergent alternate squint with hyperactivity of both inferior oblique muscles and inferior rectus muscle of the left eye was treated without surgery, only by the conservative treatment with prisms. In all patients we obtained a straight position of the head despite of the nystagmus still existing during the eyes movements in some directions. The treatment by using hyper-correcting prisms can completely replace the surgical treatment or is able to supplement it and prevent relapses."

  "date": "1996 Mar",
  "abstract": "Chronic placement of the head anterior to the body's center of gravity can be a component in the development of neurovascular and musculoskeletal dysfunction. In order to evaluate and treat dysfunction and pain, physical therapists need to be aware of variables that can affect head position. The objectives of this study were to investigate the interaction between wearing multifocal lenses and head posture; to determine the interaction of forward head posture and upper quarter pain; and to determine the intratester reliability of a head posture gauge. Head posture and self-reported pain were collected on 25 randomly chosen multifocal lens wearers between the ages of 40 and 50 and compared with a similar group of nonmultifocal lens wearers. The mean forward head posture in the two groups were significantly different (t = 2.06, one-tailed, p = 0.023). Subjects wearing multifocal lenses had a greater degree of forward head posture when compared with nonmultifocal lens wearers. A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare forward head posture with pain. In this sample, mean forward head posture levels did not differ significantly according to level of pain (p = 0.15). Intratester reliability of the head posture gauge was demonstrated to be high through the use of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.99). Wearing multifocal lenses may influence a person to hold his/her head in a position more forward than the ideal postural alignment."

  "date": "1996 Jan 1",
  "abstract": "Study design: This study used a repeated measures design to assess the effects of multiple sitting postures on various spinal angles. All subjects were tested in slouched, erect, forward inclined, and comfortable postures.\nObjectives: The purposes of this study were to evaluate the changes in head, cervical, lumbar, and pelvic postures in different sitting positions and also to determine if there is a relation between lumbar posture and cervical posture during sitting.\nSummary of background data: Clinicians commonly assert that head and neck position is strongly influenced by lumbar and pelvic position. A biomechanical model was developed that allowed detailed, quantitative description of head, neck, lumbar, and pelvic postures. This model enabled a distinction to be made between upper and lower cervical motions.\nMethods: Various spinal angles were measured in 30 healthy subjects in four sitting positions using a three-dimensional digitizing system. Reliability of the measurement procedure was determined using an intraclass correlation coefficient and the values for most angles was above 0.8.\nResults: With the exception of head orientation, analysis of variance revealed significant differences in spinal angles between different sitting positions. Head orientation appeared to be maintained by compensatory adjustments in both the upper and lower cervical spine and changes in lumbar posture were associated with compensatory changes in overall cervical position. As the lumbar spine moved toward extension, the cervical spine flexed and as the lumbar spine flexed the cervical spine extended. However, there was variation among subjects as to whether cervical spine adjustments occurred primarily in the upper or lower cervical region.\nConclusions: Different sitting postures clearly resulted in changes in cervical spine position. Lumbar and pelvic position should be considered when control of cervical posture is desired."

The analysis is based on findings contributed by scientific investigations in the field of dentofacial orthopedics and dysfunction. Special emphasis has been put on the influence of forward head posture on the craniofacial growth as it can determine a morphoskeletal and neuromuscular pattern leading to a dysfunctional condition. A correlation is established between Class II Occlusion, forward head posture, and craniomandibular dysfunction. The concept of craniocervical postural position is defined, as well as its close relation to the mandibular postural position."

  "date": "1996",
  "abstract": "Five subjects performed a maximal exercise test of repetitive lifting and lowering, with a discontinuous protocol of incremental exercise (3 min) and relative rest (2 min). Exercise periods consisted of repetitive lifting and repetitive lifting and lowering at increasing movement frequencies. Relative rest periods consisted of ergometer cycling at a constant, low power output. An unexpected, dissociated, response of cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters was found: during relative rest, values for oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, pulmonary ventilation and tidal volume were significantly higher than during the preceding exercise periods, though exercise intensity was much lower. To our knowledge, such a response has not been reported in previous studies. Since the response could not be attributed to methodological or technical factors, it is hypothesized that the type of exercise itself impeded the optimal performance of the oxygen transporting system. The function of the pulmonary system could have been influenced by a high intra-abdominal pressure, the involvement of respiratory muscles in stabilizing trunk and head, a flexed trunk posture and the entrainment of respiratory frequency with movement frequency. More likely, the function of the cardiovascular system was hindered by a high blood pressure and high intramuscular pressures. Since this response occurred at low exercise intensities, optimal functioning of the cardiovascular and pulmonary system during daily activities of repetitive lifting and lowering could similarly be impeded. The hypotheses put forward could also explain the lower peak oxygen uptake reported during repetitive lifting, compared to running and cycling."

  "date": "1996",
  "abstract": "The predatory behavior of free ranging praying mantises, Sphodromantis lineola (Burmeister), in response to prey at various positions in the midsagittal plane, was examined using high speed (200 frames per second) videography. Predatory strikes fell neatly into two categories based on the elevation of the prey from the surface on which the mantises stood: high strikes and low strikes. When the prey was 35 degrees or more above the surface (measured from the mesothoracic tarsus), mantises assumed a posture that elevated and pointed the body upwards (high strikes). When prey was near or below the surface on which the mantises stood, they assumed a posture that lowered the body and shifted its center of gravity forward (low strikes). Each of these two initial postures was followed by distinctly different constellations of movements, which included a rapid grasping movement of the raptorial forelegs and, if the prey was sufficiently distant, a displacement of the body upwards (high strikes) or forwards (low strikes). Our analyses suggest that prothoracic angle and, to a lesser degree, head angle and the degree to which the mesothoracic legs are extended provide the critical proprioceptive cues used in programming the appropriate attach sequence. Based on our results, we hypothesize that mantises process visual and proprioceptive information indicating prey location in 'pterothorax-centered space'."

  "abstract": "We examined the ability to assess subjective orientation and orientation of an external visual object during pitch tilt. Subjects were seated, restrained, and in darkness in a simulator and estimated when they were 0 degree, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees forwards and backwards from upright during pitching at 1 degree/s. They temporarily stopped in these positions and set a 5 cm luminous cube, cockpit mounted at 60 cm from the nasium, to earth vertical. Estimates of subjective tilt were consistently greater than actual tilt. Overestimations were increased by preceding tilts in the opposite direction, particularly when tilting from forwards, where subjects sometimes estimated they were tilted backwards when the machine was tilted forwards. Subjects were surprised with their estimates, and reported disorientation. Regardless, settings of the visual vertical made \"intuitively\" were largely accurate. Subjective estimates could be construed as \"accurate\" if one assumes that the rostro-caudal axis of the head was referenced for estimates of upright and forwards and a trunk-leg axis for backwards. Because labyrinthine defective patients behaved as normal subjects, task performance must have been based on proprioception. The overestimation of tilt is exploited in fairground illusions and may account for the common experience when driving, that hills seem much steeper than they are."

  "date": "1996 Jan",
  "abstract": "One of the goals of early treatment of Class III malocclusion with maxillary expansion and protraction headgear is to significantly improve the dentofacial profile. The objectives of the present study were to determine (1) the interrelationships of the soft tissue and dentoskeletal profiles after maxillary expansion and protraction headgear treatment and (2) which cephalometric variables could contribute to an accurate prediction of the protraction effect on the soft tissue profile. Lateral cephalometric radiographs of 20 consecutively treated Class III patients (10 males, 10 females) by protraction headgear were included in this study. Their ages at the start of protraction headgear treatment ranged from 6 to 11 years, with an average of 8.1 +/- 2.1 years. None of the patients had previous orthodontic treatment. For each patient, the first lateral cephalogram was taken 6 months before the initiation of headgear treatment (T0), and the second radiograph at the start of treatment (T1). Therefore (T1-T0) represented 6 months of growth with no treatment. A third radiograph was taken 6 months after start of treatment (T2). In this way, (T2-T1)-(T1-T0) represented the effect the result of appliance therapy alone and each subject served as his/her own control. A computerized cephalometric analysis was used including variables assessing sagittal and vertical relationships of skeletal and soft tissue profiles, incisal relationships, soft tissue thickness, and lip structure. Data were analyzed by means of paired t tests, Pearson's product-moment coefficient correlation, and multiple regression analyses. The results showed significant improvements in dentofacial profile after 6 months of maxillary protraction. The skeletal and soft tissue facial profiles were straightened and the posture of the lips was improved. The normal incisal relationship (overjet) that was achieved had a significant impact on the soft tissues overlying both upper and lower incisors resulting in better lip competence and posture. Significant correlations were found between changes in the sagittal relationships of skeletal and soft tissue profiles in both the maxilla and the mandible (p < 0.05). The forward movement of the maxilla was accompanied by a corresponding forward movement of the soft tissue profile at 50% to 79% of the hard tissue. In the mandible, the downward and backward movements of the soft tissues were equivalent to 71% to 81% of the corresponding hard tissues. The lack of high r square values in the multiple regression analyses reflected a low prediction value for the maxillary variables, but moderately high prediction value for the mandibular variables that could be used in preorthopedic treatment planning. This study showed that significant dentoskeletal changes and improvements in dentofacial profile resulted from 6 months of treatment with maxillary expansion and protraction."

  "date": "1995 Oct",
  "abstract": "Semicircular canals in humans are three membranous tubes each forming two-thirds of a circle, arranged in a coordinate system. The horizontal semicircular canal makes a 30 degree angle with the horizontal plane, a phenomenon neither easily understood nor explained in Literature. This paper reports a personal opinion based on the theory of evolution. Before man assumed erect posture (Australopithecus Afarensis), more than 3 million years ago, the head was bent forward (as in other primates) so that the temporal bone (structures inside included) laid on the horizontal plane. In the Author's opinion the present alignment might have come about after the gradual change in posture in human evolution. The ampulla of the posterior canal and the non ampullary branch of the horizontal semicircular canal became the lowest part of the utricule thereby allowing otoconial debris to settle. On the basis of this hypothesis the Authors attempt to explain the high prevalence of idiopathic cupulolithiasis."

  "abstract": "We recorded vestibularly evoked potentials (VESTEPs) using natural vestibular stimuli simulating the form of a normal head movement (\"raised cosine\"). Its smooth course was designed to minimize all possible sources of artifacts of mechanical, electrical, and physiological origin. This motion profile was applied to subjects (Ss) sitting upright, thus stimulating the horizontal semicircular canals alone, as well as when they were tilted in different positions in steps of 30 degrees about the interaural y-axis, which had the effect of modulating the otolithic contribution to the horizontal VESTEP. The transient bell-shaped VESTEP recorded in the upright sitting S was more and more superimposed or replaced by a sustained negativity the more the S was tilted toward a horizontal position. Thus, the VESTEP gradually changes from a velocity response in the upright S (canals only) to a position response in the lying S (canals plus otoliths). Differences in the VESTEPs obtained for clockwise (cw) and counterclockwise (ccw) turns in the tilted S were found. The reason for this is not clear at present and requires further experimentation. However, the VESTEPs obtained under conditions involving backward tilts and cw turns corresponded to those obtained with forward tilts and ccw turns. A similar relationship was found for the VESTEPs obtained with backward tilts and ccw turns and those obtained with forward tilts and cw turns. The physiological basis of this is discussed."

However, the professional literature contains relatively few studies that have assessed the relationship between posture, function, and injury. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship and differences in postural variables within and between subjects with overuse injuries to the shoulder of healthy subjects. Thirty patient subjects and 30 healthy subjects matched for age and gender were recruited. Scapular protraction and rotation, forward head position, midthoracic curvature, and passive humeral elevation in the plane of the scapula were measured randomly in standing. All measurement techniques were standardized and validated. Intrarater and interrater reliability for all clinical measures were established before data collection. Forward head position was significantly greater (p < .001) in the patient group than the healthy group; humeral elevation was significantly greater (p < .001) in the healthy group than in the patient group and in the uninvolved shoulders (p < .01) than the involved shoulders within the patient group. Scapular protraction, rotation, midthoracic curvature, and scapular symmetry were not significantly different between groups. Scapula protraction and rotation were significantly related (p < .05) in the patient group. No other postural variables were related. Conclusions regarding the influence of posture to shoulder injury are inconclusive based on several confounding variables that may have affected the outcome."

  "abstract": "A tilting apparatus has been designed and constructed to produce fore-aft whole head-and-body tilt (WHBT) alone, or in combination with ankle dorsiflexion of standing subjects, about an axis colinear with the ankle joint. The apparatus is composed of a vertical tilting structure attached to a supporting base. Mechanical rotation of the vertical tilting structure is achieved by a spring activating system mounted on its base. Subjects are secured to the vertical structure by a body harness system with the head fixed, and the feet secured to the standing platform. Simultaneous dynamic WHBT and ankle joint displacement are induced by rotating the vertical support; whereas WHBT alone is achieved by concurrent rotation of both the vertical support and standing platform. Tilts are triggered manually, and data acquisition precedes head acceleration onset by 50-100 ms to provide suitable baseline values. This tilting apparatus has been successfully used to apply forward WHBT in 34 subjects with height ranging from 1.55 to 1.87 m and weights from 42 to 95 kg, and at magnitudes of peak head acceleration varying from 0.4 to 2.2 g as measured by a linear accelerometer mounted on a dental bite. These acceleration rates can be reproduced with minor variation in the same subjects. Moreover, the area under the head acceleration traces was reproducible within 15% between subjects. Tilts can be delivered with concomitant ankle dorsiflexion. These features make the low-cost tilting apparatus a very useful tool for the study of human tilting reactions in both laboratories and clinical settings."

  "date": "1995 Apr",
  "abstract": "Female office workers with desk jobs who are incapacitated by pain and tingling in the hands and fingers are often diagnosed by physicians as \"repetitive stress injury\" (RSI) or \"carpal tunnel syndrome\" (CTS). These patients usually have poor posture with their head and neck stooped forward and shoulders rounded; upon palpation, they have pain and tenderness at the spinous processes C5-T1 and the medial angle of the scapula. In 35 such patients we focused the treatment primarily at the posterior neck area and not the wrists and hands. A low level laser (100 mW) was used and directed at the tips of the spinous processes C5-T1. The laser rapidly alleviated the pain and tingling in the arms, hands and fingers, and diminished tenderness at the involved spinous processes. Thereby, it has become apparent that many patients labelled as having RSI or CTS have predominantly cervical radicular dysfunction resulting in pain to the upper extremities which can be managed by low level laser. Successful long-term management involves treating the soft tissue lesions in the neck combined with correcting the abnormal head, neck and shoulder posture by taping, cervical collars, and clavicle harnesses as well as improved work ergonomics."

  "abstract": "An 84-year-old driver suffered cardiac arrest after a traffic accident. He was quickly resuscitated and transferred to a hospital where he was treated in a state of unconsciousness and respiratory failure for 20 days until his death. The brain stem was rendered anoxic during cardiac arrest, which caused the respiratory failure. Artificial ventilation and catecholamine infusion were carried out, resulting in myocardial degeneration. Bilateral stenosis of the vertebral arteries was disclosed, but no injuries or hemorrhage of the brain and spinal cord were detected. On days 3 and 4 after admission, immediately after the head of the victim was flexed forward for examinations, cardiac arrest was induced twice, but was controlled either by administering atropine or by restoring the original posture. Positional change is known to induce vagal reflex that results in bradycardia, hypotension or cardiac arrest in sensitive persons. The victim might have undergone the reflex-mediated cardiac arrest after the accident, to which the stenosis of the vertebral arteries may have contributed."

Lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, head position, shoulder position, shoulder height, pelvic tilt, and leg length were measured using a photographic technique. In standing, chronic pain patients exhibited an increased lumbar lordosis compared with controls (p < .05). Acute patients had an increased thoracic kyphosis and a forward head position compared with controls (p < .05). In sitting, acute patients had an increased thoracic kyphosis compared with controls (p < .05). These postural parameters identified discrete postural profiles but had moderate value as predictors of low back pain.

  "abstract": "The present study focused on the development of a procedure to assess perceived self-motion induced by visual surround motion--vection. Using an apparatus that permitted independent control of visual and inertial stimuli, prone observers were translated along their head x-axis (fore/aft). The observers' task was to report the direction of self-motion during passive forward and backward translations of their bodies coupled with exposure to various visual surround conditions. The proportion of \"forward\" responses was used to calculate each observer's point of subjective equality (PSE) for each surround condition. The results showed that the moving visual stimulus produced a significant shift in the PSE when data from the moving surround condition were compared with the stationary surround and no-vision condition. Further, the results indicated that vection increased monotonically with surround velocities between 4 and 40 degrees/sec. It was concluded that linear vection can be measured in terms of changes in the amplitude of whole-body inertial acceleration required to elicit equivalent numbers of \"forward\" and \"backward\" self-motion reports."

The distances from the plumb line to the ear, to the seventh vertebra, and to the shoulder were measured. Two angles were also measured: (1) ear-seventh cervical vertebra-horizontal plane and (2) eye-ear-seventh cervical vertebra. The only measurement that revealed a statistically significant difference was angle ear-seventh cervical vertebra-horizontal plane. This angle was smaller in the patients with temporomandibular disorders than in the control subjects. In other words, when evaluating the ear position with respect to the seventh cervical vertebra, the head was positioned more forward in the group with temporomandibular disorders than in the control group (P < .05)."

  "abstract": "This paper is a summary of several papers published in different journals and conference proceedings. The contents deal with the incidence of load related musculoskeletal illness of female workers exposed to various workloads. Furthermore, the changes in workload due to improved workplace design and the effect on the incidence of musculoskeletal illness was evaluated. The sick-leave due to musculoskeletal illness was reduced from 5.3% to 3.1% and the reduction in turn-over from 30.1% to 7.6%. The cost and the benefits of this ergonomic intervention were analysed, and showed that an investment of NOK. 350,000 produced total savings of NOK. 3,200,000. Postural load was assessed by recording electromyography (EMG) on the upper part of musculus trapezius, postural angles of the upper arm and flexion/extension of the head and back. A quantitative relationship was found between the static trapezius load and the development of musculoskeletal sick-leave, related to the length of employment. Indications were found that certain factors were associated with reduced incidence of musculoskeletal illness. These were: increasing the number and total duration of trapezius load below 1% to 2% MVC (Maximum Voluntary Contraction); reducing the magnitude of flexion angle of the upper arm in the sagittal plane and distributing the work between flexors and extensors; and a more dynamic work pattern of the upper arm. The relationship between postural load and musculoskeletal injury was studied in comparable groups of female workers with respect to age, working hours per day and time of employment. Psychosocial problems, spare time activities and living habits of the workers did not show any significant differences across the groups. The results from this study indicate that: the static trapezius load must be kept at a minimum; a median arm flexion should be less than 15 degrees and a median arm abduction less than 10 degrees. These values seem roughly to approach an acceptable arm position; and a forward median flexion of the back of less than 20 degrees seems not to lead to a higher rate of low back pain for workers with long periods of employment."

Some data suggest a connection between surface cervical posture and head and neck pain, but the relation between surface and vertebral posture in the cervical region has not been reported.\nMethods: Lateral view radiographs of 24 healthy volunteers were used to give the surface alignment of skin markers and the locations of the geometric centers of vertebral bodies. Three angles describing sagittal alignment were investigated: 1) forward inclination of C2 relative to C7 (cervical inclination); 2) cervicothoracic kyphosis; and 3) cervical lordosis.\nResults: A strong relationship between surface and vertebral data was not established. Two factors were identified as contributing to the observed differences: length of spinous processes and depth of soft tissue overlying the spinous processes at each spinal level.\nConclusions: The assumption that the surface curve is the same as the vertebral curve is not supported by these results, suggesting caution is needed in inferring vertebral alignment from observed surface contours."

  "abstract": "Purpose: Instructions for patient positioning during panoramic radiography usually describe positioning dentate patients, and errors in patient positioning are commonly identified by distortion of the dentition. The purposes of this study were to identify common errors in panoramic radiography of edentulous patients, describe the image distortions that can be expected with positioning errors in edentulous patients, and review quality assurance methods that improve the diagnostic value of panoramic films.\nMaterials and methods: Panoramic films were randomly selected from the inactive files of 75 edentulous patients seen at the dental school for complete denture construction. The radiographs were numbered and reviewed by a board-certified oral and maxillofacial radiologist trained to identify errors in panoramic radiography.\nResults: Of the 75 panoramic radiographs examined, only 6 films (8.0%) were free of errors, and 67 films (89.3%) had one or more errors in patient positioning and 33 films (44.0%) had one or more technical errors. The most common positioning errors were positioning the chin too high (32 films, 41.3%) and positioning the patient too far forward (26 films, 34.7%).\nConclusions: Without modification, manufacturer's instructions for positioning dentate patients during panoramic radiography may result in positioning errors on the panoramic radiographs of edentulous patients. Proper training and appropriate attention to detail while exposing and developing panoramic films are required to ensure maximum diagnostic benefits for edentulous patients."

  "title": "Muscle activation patterns for reaching: the representation of distance and time",
  "date": "1994 Apr",
  "abstract": "1. The timing and intensity of phasic muscle activation were related to the distance of reaching movements of the human arm. We dissociated phasic components of muscle activation from complete muscle activation waveforms by subtracting waveforms obtained during very slow movements. 2. We recorded electromyographic (EMG) activity from elbow and/or shoulder muscles as standing subjects reached forward and upward to targets at four distances. Accuracy was deemphasized and no terminal corrections were allowed. In the first part of the experiment subjects were asked to move at their preferred speed. In the second part of the experiment they were asked to move using a range of speeds. 3. In the first part of the experiment subjects moved faster to more distant targets but they also increased movement time as a nearly linear function of target distance. The slope of this function was very similar across subjects. The phasic EMG waveforms for different distances appeared to be similar in shape but of variable duration. EMG time base was quantified using a correlation technique that identified the time base scale factor that best superimposed a given trace with a template. This technique revealed that the slope of the relation between EMG time base and target distance was not the same for all muscles. 4. In the second part of the experiment, where subjects moved to each target at a range of specified speeds, time base scaling was again significantly different for different muscles. The scaling differed most dramatically between anterior deltoid and medial head of triceps. 5. EMG intensity was more strongly related to movement time than to distance. We quantified the correspondence of distance and movement time to phasic EMG intensity using a multiple regression analysis of all distances and speeds, assuming a power relation. Distance exponents were positive and movement time exponents were larger and negative. This implies that movement time is more important than distance in its relation to EMG intensity."

  "date": "1994 Feb",
  "abstract": "The faces of fifteen adult patients who had undergone surgical orthodontic treatment were videotaped frontally and laterally in order to observe their oral circumferential behavior for function and their facial muscle posture at rest. As the ANB angle became 0.9 degrees from -3.5 degrees and the occlusal relationship improved to normal, facial morphology became harmoneous. In general observation, habits of facial muscle tensity at rest was reduced and lip sucking following forward tongue thrusting was decreased after treatment. Pronunciation of previously unclear sounds such as 'Ta' and 'Sa' improved and breath leakage decreased after treatment. The cooperative motions between lips and tongue improved significantly. Although a few subjects still had weak lip tensity and facial muscles, habits of tongue thrusting during swallowing were generally reduced and swallowing motions became more natural. As the movement of tongue tip became smoother, rhythmical chewing improved, and they became capable of chewing on both sides. Good relationships between morphology, oral function, and muscular behavior are very important in stabilization of the normal dentition after surgical orthodontic treatment. Normally maintained forces of balanced occlusion reduce the possibility of relapse."

This study examined the reliability of physical characteristics of the head, shoulders and thoracic spine and identified relationships among them. Measurements were made from photographs of subjects in comfortable erect standing. A forward head position was related to the curvature of the upper thoracic spine, and a forward position of the shoulders to the tilt of the head in the sagittal plane and to upper cervical extension. The magnitude of the relationships, however, was of questionable clinical significance. No relationship was found between a forward head position and forward shoulders, nor between a forward head position and upper cervical spine extension."

  "title": "Epigenetic development of postural responses for sitting during infancy",
  "date": "1994",
  "abstract": "This study examined whether postural responses emerge in children in a predetermined way before independent sitting is achieved, and in what respect postural responses in infants differ from those in adults. Children just able to sit independently and children not yet able to sit were exposed to surface perturbations (translation and rotation) while body movement and electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded. Perturbations causing a backward sway of the body (i.e., forward translation and legs-up rotation), elicited consistent patterns of muscle activity in ventral hip, trunk, and neck muscles in the independently sitting children. A high tonic EMG background activity in trunk and neck extensor muscles was inhibited at the onset of the ventral muscle activity. Kinematic analysis revealed that backward rotation of the pelvis was the first detectable body movement, while head movements (linear and angular displacement) were irregular and occurred later than the pelvis movement. Perturbations in the opposite direction, causing a forward sway, evoked variable responses in dorsal trunk and neck muscles, suggesting that the excitability level for postural responses was set according to the stability limits of the body. Children not yet able to sit without support were tested when the support around the waist, given by the experimenter's hands, was released prior to the onset of the platform perturbation. Postural responses were elicited in ventral muscles following a backward sway in all children and in about 60% of all trials. Often, only some of the ventral muscles were activated. No distinct responses were evoked during perturbations imposing a forward sway. These results suggest that (1) backward rotation of the pelvis triggers the postural adjustments in the independently sitting children; (2) a basic form of the postural adjustment develops in a predetermined manner before children practice independent sitting; and (3) the basic structure of ventral muscle activation pattern resembles that of adults, while the activation of the dorsal muscles (inhibition) differs in several aspects. These findings are in agreement with a recent model of central pattern generators for postural responses consisting of two operative levels. At the first level, which is triggered by backward rotation of the pelvis, the basic activation pattern is generated. At the second level, the pattern is shaped and fine-tuned by multisensory interactions from all activated sensory systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

  "title": "Postural adjustments in sitting humans following external perturbations: muscle activity and kinematics",
  "date": "1994",
  "abstract": "There are several controversies concerning the organization and induction of postural adjustments in standing humans. Some investigators suggest the responses are triggered by somatosensory inputs (especially from the ankle in standing subjects), while others emphasize the vestibular input induced by head acceleration. We examined postural responses in sitting subjects in order to describe the muscle activation pattern during various perturbations and to test whether somatosensory or vestibular stimulation elicited the responses. The kinematics and EMG patterns in response to perturbations caused by movements of the support surface were studied in adults. The postural muscle activation following a backward sway was mainly the same, whether it was elicited by a forward translation or a legs-up rotation. This is remarkable, since, except for pelvis rotation, the movements of all body segments including the head differed in the two conditions. Furthermore, a second experiment showed that the direction of the initial head movement could be reversed with retainment of the same postural muscle activation pattern. The results suggest that somatosensory signals derived from the backward rotation of the pelvis, and not vestibular information from the head, trigger postural responses during sitting. There was a slight but consistent difference in the muscle activation pattern, whether the backward sway was elicited by a forward translation or legs-up rotation. The difference seemed to reflect the sensory information from head and other body parts (except the pelvis). This finding allowed us to speculate in a central pattern generator for postural adjustments containing two levels. At the first level, a simple format of the muscle activation would be generated; at the second level, the centrally generated pattern could be shaped and timed by interaction from the entire somatosensory, vestibular, and visual input."

  "date": "1994 Jan",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of head posture on occlusion in subjects with craniovertebral fusion to that in normal unfused subjects. The experimental group consisted of five subjects (age range 30-76) who have all undergone previous surgical fusion of the craniovertebral region. The control group consisted of five unfused subjects matched by age, race and gender. Each subject's tooth contacts were recorded with a computerized dental instrument known as the T-scan. The tooth contacts were measured several times for each subject with the head tilted backwards (45 degrees) and forwards (30 degrees). A modification of Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used to compare the location of the tooth contacts and compare any variations between the craniovertebral-fused subjects' occlusal contact patterns and those of the normal nonfused patients. The results indicated that four of the five fused subjects had occlusal contact patterns that differed from their matched counterparts, thus suggesting that fusion of the craniovertebral region interferes with a normal mechanism that permits changes in head posture to shift tooth contact points. These results suggest that those who manage problems related to occlusion (craniofacial pain syndromes) need to consider the influence of the craniovertebral region on both occlusion and jaw position."

  "date": "1994",
  "abstract": "Unexpected ventral and dorsal perturbations and expected, self-induced ventral perturbations were delivered to the trunk by suddenly loading a vest strapped to the torso. Six male subjects were measured for intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and intra-muscular electromyography of the transversus abdominis (TrA), obliquus internus abdominis (OI), obliquus externus abdominis (OE) and rectus abdominis (RA) muscles. Erector spinae (ES) activity was recorded using surface electromyography. Displacements of the trunk and head were registered using a video-based system. Unexpected ventral loading produced activity in TrA, OI, OE and RA, and an IAP increase well in advance of activity from ES. Expected ventral loading produced pre-activation of all muscles and an increased IAP prior to the perturbation. The TrA was always the first muscle active in both the unexpected and self-loading conditions. Of the two ventral loading conditions, forward displacement of the trunk was significantly reduced during the self-loading. Unexpected dorsal loading produced coincident activation of TrA, OI, OE, RA and ES. These results indicate a response of the trunk muscles to sudden expected and unexpected ventral loadings other than the anticipated immediate extensor torque production through ES activation. It is suggested that the increase in IAP is a mechanism designed to improve the stability of the trunk through a stiffening of the whole segment."

  "date": "1994",
  "abstract": "The development of a number of sensorimotor reflexes was studied in the Brazilian opossum Monodelphis domestica. At birth, an opossum's forelimbs execute rhythmic, alternate movements which resemble swimming, whereas the hindlimbs are little more than embryonic buds that do not move independent of the trunk. It is possible, therefore, to witness the entire development of hindlimb motility, the advent of coordination between forelimbs and hindlimbs, and the development of ambulation. The following sequence in the appearance and maturation of the reflexes was observed: rooting, an innate reflex in mammals which disappears over time; withdrawal of the forelimbs followed by withdrawal of the hindlimbs; crossed extension of the forelimbs and then of the hindlimbs; grasp, the forelimbs preceding the hindlimbs; body righting on a surface; forward hopping of the forelimbs followed by the hindlimbs; lateral and medial hopping of the forelimbs, then the hindlimbs; chin tactile placing; body righting in the air; and, finally, visual placing. Limb tactile placing is not significantly expressed, even in the adult. This behavioral sequence generally matches the sequence of somatic (trunk, limbs, head) and neural (spinal cord and brain) structures involved in the control of these behaviors."

  "title": "Vestibular and somatosensory contributions to responses to head and body displacements in stance",
  "date": "1994",
  "abstract": "The relative contribution of vestibular and somatosensory information to triggering postural responses to external body displacements may depend on the task and on the availability of sensory information in each system. To separate the contribution of vestibular and neck mechanisms to the stabilization of upright stance from that of lower body somatosensory mechanisms, responses to displacements of the head alone were compared with responses to displacements of the head and body, in both healthy subjects and in patients with profound bilateral vestibular loss. Head displacements were induced by translating two 1-kg weights suspended on either side of the head at the level of the mastoid bone, and body displacements were induced translating the support surface. Head displacements resulted in maximum forward and backward head accelerations similar to those resulting from body displacements, but were not accompanied by significant center of body mass, ankle, knee, or hip motions. We tested the effect of disrupting somatosensory information from the legs on postural responses to head or body displacements by sway-referencing the support surface. The subjects' eyes were closed during all testing to eliminate the effects of vision. Results showed that head displacements alone can trigger medium latency (48-84 ms) responses in the same leg and trunk muscles as body displacements. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that vestibular signals alone normally trigger directionally specific postural responses to support surface translations in standing humans because: (1) initial head accelerations resulting from body and head displacements were in opposite directions, but were associated with activation of the same leg and trunk postural muscles; (2) muscle responses to displacements of the head alone were only one third of the amplitude of responses to body displacements with equivalent maximum head accelerations; and (3) patients with profound bilateral vestibular loss showed patterns and latencies of leg and trunk muscle responses to body displacements similar to those of healthy subjects. Altering somatosensory information, by sway-referencing the support surface, increased the amplitude of ankle muscle activation to head displacements and reduced the amplitude of ankle muscle activation to body displacements, suggesting context-specific reweighting of vestibular and somatosensory inputs for posture. In contrast to responses to body displacements, responses to direct head displacements appear to depend upon a vestibulospinal trigger, since trunk and leg muscle responses to head displacements were absent in patients who had lost vestibular function as adults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

  "date": "1993 Dec",
  "abstract": "Periodic linear acceleration elicits eye movements in human beings. This is generally considered to be the result of the otolithic-ocular reflex (OOR). However, otolith organs respond not only to the resultant inertial force caused by head motion, but also to the gravitational force. We investigated the influence of the resultant gravito-inertial vector on the OOR using a linear acceleration sled. Subjects were 10 healthy volunteers. The sled moving back and forth parallel to the lateral head axis stimulated the subjects. We tested each subject in 7 different positions in the pitch plane. Horizontal eye movements with nystagmic patterns were elicited by these stimuli. The results indicate that the responses were larger in the forward tilted positions than in the backward tilted positions. It can be concluded that the horizontal OOR is influenced by the gravity vector. The cause of this phenomenon is still unclear. However, it could be closely related to the nystagmus observed during off vertical axis rotation."

Interpretation of the facial structure was made by using both intracranial and the extracranial reference lines. The sample comprised natural head posture (NHP) cephalograms of 106 dental students, aged 19 to 29 years. Results showed that, when the facial structure was evaluated by using a NHP analysis based on extracranial reference lines, it was associated with the inclination of the cervical column to the true horizontal. In addition, in the natural position of the head, inclination of the NSL reference was found to be associated with the vertical localization of sella turcica (r = -724, p < or = 0.001), rather than the \"extension\" or \"flexion\" of the head. It was concluded that associations between posture and structure of the head are merely caused by the functional factors related to \"forward cervical posture\" and \"vertical cervical posture\"."

  "date": "1993 Dec",
  "abstract": "1. The complex spike activity of Purkinje cells in the flocculus in response to rotational flowfields was recorded extracellularly in anesthetized pigeons. 2. The optokinetic stimulus was produced by a rotating \"planetarium projector.\" A light source was placed in the center of a tin cylinder, which was pierced with numerous small holes. A pen motor oscillated the cylinder about its long axis. This apparatus was placed above the bird's head and the resultant rotational flow-field was projected onto screens that surrounded the bird on all four sides. The axis of rotation of the planetarium could be oriented to any position in three-dimensional space. 3. Two types of responses were found: vertical axis (VA; n = 43) neurons responded best to visual rotation about the vertical axis, and H-135i neurons (n = 34) responded best to rotation about a horizontal axis. The preferred orientation of the horizontal axis was at approximately 135 degrees ipsilateral azimuth. VA neurons were excited by rotation about the vertical axis producing forward (temporal to nasal) and backward motion in the ipsilateral and contralateral eyes, respectively, and were inhibited by rotation in the opposite direction. H-135i neurons in the left flocculus were excited by counterclockwise rotation about the 135 degrees ipsilateral horizontal axis and were inhibited by clockwise motion. Thus, the VA and H-135i neurons, respectively, encode visual flowfields resulting from head rotations stimulating the ipsilateral horizontal and ipsilateral anterior semicircular canals. 4. Sixty-seven percent of VA and 80% of H-135i neurons had binocular receptive fields, although for most binocular cells the ipsilateral eye was dominant. Binocular stimulation resulted in a greater depth of modulation than did monocular stimulation of the dominant eye for 69% of the cells. 5. Monocular stimulation of the VA neurons revealed that the best axis for the contralateral eye was tilted back 11 degrees, on average, to the best axis for ipsilateral stimulation. For the H-135i neurons, the best axes for monocular stimulation of the two eyes were approximately the same. 6. By stimulating circumscribed portions of the monocular receptive fields of the H-135i neurons with alternating upward and downward largefield motion, it was revealed that the contralateral receptive fields were bipartite. Upward motion was preferred in the anterior 45 degrees of the contralateral field, and downward motion, was preferred in the central 90 degrees of the contralateral visual field.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Extracellular recordings were made from 235 neurons in the vestibulocerebellum (VbC), including the flocculus (lateral VbC), nodulus (folium X), and ventral uvula (ventral folium IXc,d), of the anesthetized pigeon, in response to an optokinetic stimulus. 2. The optokinetic stimuli consisted of two black and white random-dot patterns that were back-projected onto two large tangent screens. The screens were oriented parallel to each other and placed on either side of the bird's head. The resultant stimulus covered the central 100 degrees x 100 degrees of each hemifield. The directional tuning characteristics of each unit were assessed by moving the largefield stimulus in 12 different directions, 30 degrees apart. The directional tuning curves were performed monocularly or binocularly. The binocular directional tuning curves were performed with the direction of motion the same in both eyes (in-phase; e.g., ipsi = upward, contra = upward) or with the direction of motion opposite in either eye (antiphase; e.g., ipsi = upward, contra = downward). 3. Mossy fiber units (n = 17) found throughout folia IXa,b and IXc,d had monocular receptive fields and exhibited direction selectivity in response to stimulation of either the ipsilateral (n = 12) or contralateral (n = 5) eye. None had binocular receptive fields. 4. The complex spike (CS) activity of 218 Purkinje cells in folia IXc,d and X exhibited direction selectivity in response to the large-field visual stimulus moving in one or both visual fields. Ninety-one percent of the cells had binocular receptive fields that could be classified into four groups: descent neurons (n = 112) preferred upward motion in both eyes; ascent neurons (n = 14) preferred downward motion in both eyes; roll neurons (n = 33) preferred upward and downward motion in the ipsilateral and contralateral eyes, respectively; and yaw neurons (n = 40) preferred forward and backward motion in the ipsilateral and contralateral eyes, respectively. Within all groups, most neurons (70%) showed an ipsilateral dominance. 5. For most binocular neurons (91%), the maximum depth of modulation occurred with simultaneous stimulation of both eyes, compared with monocular stimulation of the dominant eye alone. For the translation neurons (descent and ascent), binocular inphase stimulation produced the maximum depth of modulation, whereas for the rotation neurons (roll and yaw), binocular antiphase stimulation produced the maximum depth of modulation. 6. There was a clear functional segregation of the translation and rotation neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

A passive accessory intervertebral mobility (PAIVM) examination was performed to confirm an upper cervical articular cause of the subjects' headache and a questionnaire was used to establish a profile of the headache population. Measurements of cranio-cervical posture and isometric strength and endurance of the upper cervical flexor muscles were compared between the two groups of subjects. The headache group was found to be significantly different from the non-headache group in respect to forward head posture (FHP) (t = -5.98, p < 0.00005), less isometric strength (t = 3.43, p < 0.001) and less endurance (t = 8.71, p < 0.0005) of the upper cervical flexors. A statistically significant relationship was also established between natural head posture and isometric endurance of the upper cervical flexor musculature which demonstrated that FHP corresponded with a low endurance capacity (chi 2 = 13.2; p < 0.01). The outcome of this study highlights the need to screen for cervical etiology in patients who are suspected of suffering from common migraine."

  "date": "1993 Jul",
  "abstract": "Numerous hypotheses explaining interspecific differences in the degree of basicranial flexion have been presented. Several authors have argued that an increase in relative brain size results in a spatial packing problem that is resolved by flexing the basicranium. Others attribute differences in the degree of basicranial flexion to different postural behaviors, suggesting that more orthograde animals require a ventrally flexed pre-sella basicranium in order to maintain the eyes in a correct forward-facing orientation. Less specific claims are made for a relationship between the degree of basicranial flexion and facial orientation. In order to evaluate these hypotheses, the degree of basicranial flexion (cranial base angle), palate orientation, and orbital axis orientation were measured from lateral radiographs of 68 primate species and combined with linear and volumetric measures as well as data on the size of the neocortex and telencephalon. Bivariate correlation and partial correlation analyses at several taxonomic levels revealed that, within haplorhines, the cranial base angle decreases with increasing neurocranial volume relative to basicranial length and is positively correlated with angles of facial kyphosis and orbital axis orientation. Strepsirhines show no significant correlations between the cranial base angle and any of the variables examined. It is argued that prior orbital approximation in the ancestral haplorhine integrated the medial orbital walls and pre-sella basicranium into a single structural network such that changes in the orientation of one necessarily affect the other. Gould's (\"Ontogeny and Phylogeny.\" Cambridge: Belknap Press, 1977) hypothesis, that the highly flexed basicranium of Homo may be due to a combination of a large brain and a relatively short basicranium, is corroborated."

  "abstract": "The relationship between craniofacial asymmetry, congenital muscular torticollis, and cervical spine subluxation was examined in a study of 30 children who presented to our Craniofacial Program from 1987 through 1990. Twenty-six of the 30 patients had craniofacial asymmetry and muscular torticollis without true suture synostosis documented by head and neck CT scans. These 26 patients had positional skull molding with consistent flattening of the contralateral occipitoparietal region and the ipsilateral fronto-orbital region relative to the side of the torticollis. Thirteen of the 26 patients also were found to have a C1-C2 subluxation. C1 was rotated forward of C2 on the side contralateral to the muscular torticollis in 12 of 13 patients. None of the patients with subluxation had neurologic deficits or required spinal stabilization. Ophthalmologic evaluations demonstrated amblyopia (4 patients) and horizontal strabismus (1 patient), both thought to be coincidental, with no evidence of nystagmus in any case. Seven of the 26 patients required surgical therapy for their neck muscle tightness, while the remainder responded to physiotherapy. Only 2 of the 26 patients underwent cranio-orbital reshaping for correction of their upper face asymmetry. Recognition of cervical subluxation in patients with congenital muscular torticollis may help to explain residual head-neck posturing problems even after successful neck muscle therapy."

  "date": "1993 Jun",
  "abstract": "Sleep in five blackbirds was investigated by continuous 24-h recordings of EEG, EOG, EMG, HR, and behavior. Because these recordings were similar in many respects to those obtained previously in other species, it was possible to define the electrophysiological correlates of active wakefulness (AW), quiet wakefulness (QW), slow wave sleep (SWS), and paradoxical sleep (PS). The time spent in SWS and PS was 32.2% and 5.7% of the 24-h period, respectively. The amount of SWS decreased during the course of the dark period, whereas PS exhibited an increasing trend. In addition, SWS always preceded PS, as in mammals. Thus, homeotherms may share common mechanisms of sleep regulation. Blackbirds turned their heads so that their beaks pointed backwards only during darkness. This back posture was usually associated with sleep. Head nodding, which occurred only when the beak pointed forward, was observed during 13% of PS episodes. Eye closure was a reliable behavioral index of sleep. Detailed behavioral observations alone do not provide sufficient information for the accurate assessment of sleep stages in blackbirds."

Pictures were taken in two body positions, standing and sitting. The male faces were, on average, wider and longer than the female faces, in both frontal and lateral views, with greater differences in the mouth and chin regions. Both sexes were generally symmetrical. Persons who were asymmetric compensated for their appearance by changing head posture relative to the ground, so that in the frontal plane, the interpupillary axis and the occlusal plane were parallel to the ground. Measurements can be employed in computer graphic reconstructions used in orthognathic, maxillofacial, and plastic surgery. In the standing position, the Frankfurt plane was directed upward and forward, with a mean angle of 13 degrees relative to the ground. In seated subjects, it was more nearly horizontal (5 degrees in the men, 8 degrees in the women). This result confirms the need for a careful reevaluation of standard cephalometric and photographic protocols."

Repeated measurements were made using a standardized protocol on 40 patients seated in a standardized position. The seven testers had from 1 to 8 years of clinical experience. All measurements were recorded by the same investigator. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC[1,1]) was used to quantitate within-tester and between-tester reliability. Measurements of forward head position performed by the same physical therapist had high reliability (ICC = 0.93). Good reliability (ICC = 0.83) was demonstrated when different physical therapists measured the forward head posture of the same patient. We concluded that measurements of forward head posture made by physical therapists trained in the correct use of the CROM instrument are reliable. This reliability is important for determining the effectiveness of treatment programs. On the basis of our data, the CROM instrument will assist clinicians in the objective evaluation and reassessment of the patient population demonstrating forward head posture."

  "title": "Human stance on a sinusoidally translating platform: balance control by feedforward and feedback mechanisms",
  "date": "1993",
  "abstract": "With subjects standing on a treadmill moving sinusoidally backward and forward, recordings of electromyographic (EMG) leg and trunk muscle activity, head and joint movements and platform torque were made with the subjects' eyes open or closed. The sinusoidal frequency was changed, stepwise and randomly, between 0.5, 0.3 and 0.25 Hz. The amplitude of the deflection was constant at +/- 12 cm. During an adapted sinus cycle, the maximum leg muscle EMG activity was recorded in the tibialis anterior around the posterior turning point and in the gastrocnemius around the anterior turning point in the treadmill cycle. This activity was associated with a forward inclination of the body around the posterior point and a straightening of the body at the anterior point. Both the degree of body inclination and the corresponding EMG activity were dependent upon the sinusoidal frequency. The programmed adjustment of the body inclination was such that the result of inertial and gravitational forces acting on the body coincided with the axis of the body at the posterior turning point. At the anterior point, the adjustment was achieved mainly by strong activation of the leg extensors. The latencies of the compensatory muscle responses to a change in treadmill frequency were significantly shorter at the posterior point for the gastrocnemius than for the tibialis anterior, and at the anterior point for the tibialis anterior than for the gastrocnemius. No correlated changes were seen in the corresponding head and joint movements. The difference in latency can best be attributed to the different body postures during the sinusoid. Early activation of the gastrocnemius is required due to the forward-directed impulse to the inclined body at the posterior point, and of the tibialis anterior muscle due to the backward-directed impulse to the erect body at the anterior point. It is suggested that afferent input from extensor load receptors provides information about the position of the body's centre of gravity relative to the support surface and determines the generation of the EMG responses. Adaptation of both the EMG and biomechanical patterns to a new sinusoidal frequency of the treadmill occurred within four cycles after the change. Biomechanically, this was reflected as a change in the body posture. Vision did not significantly affect these changes. In conclusion, standing on a sinusoidally moving platform, the nervous system acts to control the position of the body's centre of gravity relative to the feet. Body posture is adjusted in such a way that the forces acting on the body during the treadmill movements become minimised.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

  "title": "Importance of cervical muscles in galvanic body sway test",
  "date": "1993",
  "abstract": "Retro-auricular galvanic stimulation in Romberg's posture elicits body sway which consists of an initial response (IR) and a deviation response (DR). Generally, anodal stimulation of the right side elicits IR to the left and DR to the right. We measured the deviation response (VDR) in various conditions in normal subjects. There was no significant difference between mean VDR in the standing posture weighted on the left foot (0.49 +/- 0.17 cm) and on the right foot (0.39 +/- 0.20 cm). Stimulation in the squatting posture also elicited IR to the left and DR to the right. Stimulation of the right side produced DR backward and to the right in the condition of the head facing to the right, and forward and to the right in the condition of the head facing to the left. The same body sway response as the after galvanic stimulation was also induced by non-galvanic maneuvers like inclining the head or moving the finger. Anodal stimulation in the sitting posture elicited slight but apparent head inclination to the stimulated side. These results suggest that cervical muscles play an important role in the galvanic body sway test (GBST), viz. IR and DR seemed to be secondarily produced by changes in the muscular tension of the neck."

  "date": "1993",
  "abstract": "Application of a small (around 1 mA), constant electric current between the mastoid processes (galvanic stimulation) of a standing subject produces enhanced body sway in the approximate direction of the ear behind which the anode is placed. We examined the electromyographic (EMG) responses evoked by such stimulation in the soleus and in the triceps brachii muscles. For soleus, subjects stood erect, with their eyes closed, leaning slightly forward. The head was turned approximately 90 degrees to the right or left relative to the feet. In averaged records (n = 40), current pulses of 25 ms or longer modulated the EMG in a biphasic manner: a small early component (latency 62 +/- 2.4 ms, mean +/- SEM) was followed by a larger late component (latency 115 +/- 5.2 ms) of opposite sign, which was appropriate to produce the observed body sway. The early component produced no measurable body movement. Lengthening the duration of the stimulus pulse from 25 to 400 ms prolonged the late component of the response but had little effect on the early component. Short- and long-latency EMG responses were also evoked in the triceps brachii muscle if subjects stood on a transversely pivoted platform and had to use the muscle to maintain their balance in the anteroposterior plane by holding a fixed handle placed by the side of their hip. The latency of the early component was 41 +/- 2.6 ms; the latency of the late component was 138 +/- 4.3 ms and was again of appropriate sign for producing the observed body sway. Galvanic stimulation evoked no comparable responses in either triceps brachii or soleus muscles if these muscles were not being used posturally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

  "date": "1993",
  "abstract": "The paper is dealing with the description of a simple and inexpensive technique for recording and measuring of the head sway during upright stance. In particular the recording system and the evaluation of the body sway data are highlighted. The objectives of the head sway signal analysis are the determination of sway components in the side-to-side (lateral) direction and forward-backward (anteroposterior) direction. It is anticipated that it will be possible to extract from the digitized data some information about the transfer characteristic and stability margin of the neuromuscular control system concerned with the maintenance of equilibrium. Additional information of potential clinical significance could be obtained by correlating the measured sway data with electromyographically determined changes in the activity of the main postural muscles. The information obtained is comparable to that gathered by more sophisticated, and more expensive conventional devices. A special feature is the easy portability of the system which permits collection of stabilometric data even in remote locations, while the analysis on which the diagnostic assessment is based can be performed at a later date in a central facility equipped with the necessary instrumentation."

  "date": "1993 Summer",
  "abstract": "Three-dimensional squirrel monkey eye movements were recorded during and immediately following rotation around an earth-vertical yaw axis (160 degrees/s steady state, 100 degrees/s2 acceleration and deceleration). To study interactions between the horizontal angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and head orientation, postrotatory VOR alignment was changed relative to gravity by tilting the head out of the horizontal plane (pitch or roll tilt between 15 degrees and 90 degrees) immediately after cessation of motion. Results showed that in addition to post rotatory horizontal nystagmus, vertical nystagmus followed tilts to the left or right (roll), and torsional nystagmus followed forward or backward (pitch) tilts. When the time course and spatial orientation of eye velocity were considered in three dimensions, the axis of eye rotation always shifted toward alignment with gravity, and the postrotatory horizontal VOR decay was accelerated by the tilts. These phenomena may reflect a neural process that resolves the sensory conflict induced by this postrotatory tilt paradigm."

  "abstract": "We measured rotation (horizontal, vertical and torisonal) and translation (horizontal and vertical) of the paralysed cat's eye in response to 45 degrees steps of orientation presented in a pseudorandom order around the roll and pitch axes (with respect to the horizontal canals). During changes of position of the animal in the roll plane, the eyes rotated towards the lowest part of the orbit (left with left ear down; top when the cat was upside down, etc.) by an average of 0.55 degree. Changing orientation in the pitch plane evoked vertical rotations of +/- 1.42 degrees (upwards eye movement during forwards head pitch) and torsional rotations of +/- 1.3 degrees. All these rotations taken together suggest that the centre of mass is in front of, below and temporal to the centre of rotation. The eyes translated temporally (thus separating by 0.72 mm) during forward pitching and there was a small vertical displacement (0.23 mm) when the animal was upside down. These findings are discussed with respect to a possible role of the extraocular proprioception system."

Twenty-two patients at a single head, neck, and temporomandibular joint treatment center, who had the diagnosis of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint, were compared with a control group of volunteers. The angle of each patient's head position was measured from four photographs (two of the patient sitting and two of the patient standing) with a diagonal line drawn from the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra to the tragus of the ear and a horizontal line drawn perpendicular to a plumb line suspended from the ceiling. The angles measured from each of the four photographs were averaged, and this figure was paired with that generated from an age- and gender-matched person in the control group. Results indicated that there was not a significantly greater degree of forward head posture in the experimental group."

  "date": "1992 Sep",
  "abstract": "To clarify the existence of the vertical component during a caloric nystagmus and the existence of a second phase of the nystagmus, 194 induced incidents of a caloric nystagmus in 29 normal subjects have been analyzed. Each nystagmus episode was recorded by using ENG and an infra-red video camera. The caloric stimuli were given by pouring 5 ml of water at 20 degrees C into the ear at an ear-up position. After irrigation, each subject then assumed a supine or a prone position, with the head bent 30 degrees forward in either position. All recordings contained vertical components that depended on the supine or prone head position and not on the side of the stimulated ear, i.e., an up-beating nystagmus resulted in the supine position and a down-beating nystagmus in the prone position. Further, the vertical component was far stronger in the prone position. In contrast, the horizontal component had larger velocities and was of longer duration in the supine position than in the prone position. When the first phase of the caloric nystagmus ended, the body position was changed 90 degrees, i.e., to a sitting position or a right-ear-down or left-ear-down position. All trials showed a horizontal component during the secondary phase when the head assumed the sitting position. As for the ear-down positions, only when the irrigated ear was moved upwards from the prone position during the secondary phase, an up-beating vertical nystagmus resulted in almost all the trials. These findings suggest that a caloric nystagmus may originate not only from the lateral semicircular canal but also from the vertical canals, and the second phase of a caloric nystagmus may be strongly influenced by the otolithic organs."

  "date": "1992 Sep-Oct",
  "abstract": "We studied 36 drop seizures in 5 patients with myoclonic astatic epilepsy of early childhood (MAEE) with simultaneous split-screen video recording and polygraph. Sixteen were falling attacks and 20 were either less severe attacks exhibiting only deep head nodding or seizures equivalent to drop attacks in terms of ictal pattern but recorded in the supine position. All seizures except those that occurred in patients in the supine position showed sudden momentary head dropping or collapse of the whole body downward. Recovery to the preictal position was observed in 0.3-1 s. As a result of carefully repeated observations, the 36 seizures were classified as myoclonic flexor type in 9, myoclonic atonic type in 2, and atonic type, with and without transient preceding symptoms in the remaining 25. The MF seizure was characterized by sudden forward flexion of the head and trunk as well as both arms, which caused the patient to fall. In the myoclonic atonic seizure, patients showed brief myoclonic flexor spasms, immediately followed by atonic falling. The AT seizure showed abrupt atonic falling, with and without transient preceding facial expression change and/or twitching of extremities. The ictal EEGs of all 36 seizures exhibited generalized bilaterally synchronous single or multiple spike(s) and wave discharges. Atonic drop attacks appear to be a common cause of ictal epileptic falling in MAEE."

  "abstract": "1. The effects of galvanic stimulation of the vestibular apparatus (with electrodes on the mastoid processes) have been studied in standing human subjects. With the head turned to one side, subjects swayed towards the anode. 2. Forwards sway was preceded by electromyographic (EMG) activity in quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles. Backwards sway was preceded by EMG activity in soleus and hamstring muscles. 3. Using the method of H reflex conditioning, forward sway was found to be preceded by inhibition of soleus motoneurones. 4. Interaction between the vestibular-evoked inhibition of soleus motoneurones preceding forwards sway and peripheral reflex inhibition was examined by a spatial facilitation method. 5. Interaction was found between vestibular-evoked inhibition and Ia reciprocal, group I non-reciprocal and group Ia-Ia presynaptic inhibitory pathways. It is concluded that vestibular signals converge on spinal interneurones subserving these inhibitory actions. 6. A 'decoupling' of soleus motoneurons and soleus-coupled Renshaw cells was found in the period of soleus activation preceding backwards sway."

  "abstract": "We investigated the quantitative relationships among pharyngeal resistance (Rph), genioglossal electromyographic (EMGge) activity, nasal resistance (Rna), and airflow in 11 normal men aged 19-50 while they were awake. We made measurements with subjects seated with the head erect, seated with the head flexed forward approximately 40 degrees, and supine. Each subject wore a face mask connected to a pneumotachograph to measure airflow. After topical anesthesia of the nose, two catheters for measuring nasal and pharyngeal airway pressures were passed through one nostril: the nasal pressure catheter was positioned at the nasal choanae, and the pharyngeal pressure catheter was positioned just above the epiglottis. We measured EMGge activity with an intraoral surface electrode. The subjects breathed exclusively through the nose while inhaling room air or rebreathing CO2. We measured Rph, Rna, airflow, and EMGge activity at approximately 90-ms intervals throughout each inspiration. Rph was invariant as head position was changed. At any given head position, EMGge activity rose as airflow increased, and Rph remained constant. In contrast, Rna increased as airflow increased. Because Rph was constant, EMGge activity was not correlated with Rph, but EMGge was positively correlated with Rna and airflow. On the basis of the stability of Rph in the face of marked changes in collapsing forces, we conclude that the dynamic interplay of posture, head and jaw position, and upper airway muscle activity quite effectively maintains pharyngeal patency, and interactions among these factors are subtle and complex."

  "date": "1992 Aug",
  "abstract": "The effects of a sagittal split ramus osteotomy in correcting mandibular retrognathism and prognathism were studied cephalometrically in a group of 25 patients. The patients were divided into two groups, 18 patients with retrognathic mandibles and 7 patients with prognathic mandibles to be corrected by means of a sagittal split ramus osteotomy according to Obwegeser Dal Pont. The major complications of this type of surgical intervention have been documented in literature and are known as (1) a certain degree of relapse, i.e., mandibular instability and (2) the development of a permanently disturbed head balance. The displacement of the dental, skeletal, and neuromuscular components within the craniomandibular complex requires a large adaptive capacity and suggests that the patient will develop a forward head posture (anteroposition of the head) after both types of surgical intervention. In mandibular advancement, however, the initiating mechanism to develop a forward head posture starts in the cervicothoracic transition (C6-C7-T1-T2). In mandibular set-back, the discussed mechanism will start in the upper cervical area (C0-C1-C2-C3). The different pattern of movement of C2 and C3 in mandibular advancement and mandibular set-back, respectively, confirmed the conclusion that the initiating mechanisms, may be found in the cervicothoracic transition and the upper cervical region, respectively."

A total of 24 patients with at least 10 teeth acting as occlusal stops were included in this study. Serial lateral cephalometric radiographs were made for each patient on four occasions (1) before extraction (2) 7 to 10 days after the initial denture insertion (3) 12 months later, and (4) 24 months later. Two angular measurements and one linear measurement were made for each radiograph and compared. A statistically significant increase in the face rest height with a tendency for posterior mandibular rotation was recorded between stages 1 and 2. This initial posterior rotation was followed by a gradual forward and upward movement, which finally brought the mandibular rest position even below the preextraction levels. The findings confirm the concept of the variability of posture and suggest that the mandibular rest position is an unreliable means of reestablishing the vertical dimension of occlusion that existed before extraction of the natural teeth."

Eighty-eight healthy subjects, aged 20 to 50 years, were asked to answer a pain questionnaire and to stand by a plumb line for postural assessment of forward head, rounded shoulders, and kyphosis. Subjects were divided into two age groups: a 20- to 35-year-old group (mean = 25, SD = 63) and a 36- to 50-year-old group (mean = 47, SD = 2.6).

Frequency counts revealed postural abnormalities were prevalent (forward head = 66%, kyphosis = 38%, right rounded shoulder = 73%, left rounded shoulder = 66%). No relationship was found between the severity of postural abnormality and the severity and frequency of pain. Subjects with more severe postural abnormalities, however, had a significantly increased incidence of pain, as determined by chi-square analysis (critical chi 2 = 6, df = 2, P less than .05). Subjects with kyphosis and rounded shoulders had an increased incidence of interscapular pain, and those with a forward-head posture had an increased incidence of cervical, interscapular, and headache pain."

Cervical spine mobility of the subjects studied was determined by vertebrogenic examination. The maximum backward extension of the head was found to reduce most markedly posture stability. Correlation analysis revealed a relationship between the functional state of the cervical spine and the degree of posture stability impairment induced by backward extension of the head, with the impairment being more pronounced in the forward-backward direction. The obtained results show that changes in the quality of proprioceptive information from the cervical spine region are also involved in determining the stability level of upright posture. The findings imply that posture with backward extension of the head can be used as a loading test for detecting ataxia of cervical origin."

The sample comprised 34 children, 16 girls and 18 boys. Cephalometric radiographs obtained in natural head position (mirror position) were taken on two occasions before orthodontic treatment. Mean age was 9.9 years at time 1 and 12.7 years at time 2. Selection of the sample was based on skeletal maturity at time 2 indicating peak activity in pubertal growth. Forty-one reference points and four fiducial points were digitized on each film. Individual growth changes in craniofacial structure were determined by computerized structural superimposition of the digitized sets of points. Correlation coefficients were calculated between 11 postural variables at the first observation and the subsequent growth rate in 36 structural variables. Uniform fields of low to moderate correlation coefficients significant at the 5%, 1%, and 0.1% levels (0.3 to 0.6) were found for eight structural variables, indicating that a small craniocervical angle and a backward-inclined upper cervical column at time 1 was associated with horizontal facial development characterized by reduced backward displacement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), large maxillary growth in length, increased facial prognathism, and larger than average true forward rotation of the mandible; whereas, a large craniocervical angle and an upright position of the upper cervical column at time 1 was associated with vertical facial development characterized by large backward displacement of the TMJ, reduced growth in length of the maxilla, reduced facial prognathism, and less than average true forward rotation of the mandible. The findings are in agreement with a theoretical model for the developmental interaction between head posture and facial structure."

  "abstract": "In order to maintain an ordinary upright posture, the body's center of gravity must be predicted and controlled on the supporting surface based on synthesis of multiple-sensory inputs. In order to evaluate the accuracy of predictive (feedforward) posture control during the performance of actions, we measured maximal shifts in the body's center of gravity using a force platform in 6 normal adults under two visual conditions (with eyes open and closed) and four standing conditions (one-legged; heel to toe posture; and both legs together or apart). Subjects were asked to perform five kinds of voluntary actions (static standing; head tilting forward, backward and laterally; head turning; bending forward; and maximal inclinations to the anterior, posterior and lateral directions). The smaller the supporting surface, the more markedly displacement of the body's center of gravity was increased upon closing the eyes. This finding suggests that the accuracy of predictive posture control decreases as a result of the reduction in the number of multisensory inputs which determine spatial orientation. Assessing purposive shifts in center of gravity during voluntary actions, we can conclude that the body's center of gravity is accurately controlled even in the presence of head movements under ordinary standing conditions. To evaluate balance during the performance of routine actions, we must devise a better method of discriminating purposive shifts in center of gravity from control disorder errors as well as a method of quantifying the accuracy of feedforward regulation."

It was anticipated that the awkward positions and intense physical demands placed on hygienists might initiate musculoskeletal problems, but that no postural changes would occur over this short period of time. Nine of 10 dental hygienists in the graduating class of 1987 were surveyed for existing musculoskeletal complaints, and the subjects were photographed for a measurement of postural change. Responses from participants indicated an increase in musculoskeletal-related complaints in each of the six areas investigated. The photographic findings indicated that one of the nine hygienists showed an increase in forward head posture, a postural change."

On the basis of previously published hypotheses, it is suggested that oropharyngeal development may be influenced by the posture, and function of the tongue, lips, and jaws. Attention is drawn to the relationship between a firm tongue to palate swallow, and the pump action of the palatine aponeurosis, which it is suggested is necessary for the aeration of the Eustachian tube. The pump action appears to be reduced in long faced adenoidal children, but clinical evidence suggests that it can be regenerated by early Orthotropics (growth guidance) aimed at directing facial growth forward, instead of downward. Any reduction in the height of the face, facilitates an improved lip seal, without which the downward pattern of facial growth is likely to continue. On occasions when these objectives are achieved it would seem that sufficient room is created to align all 32 teeth, with excellent facial form, and little otolaryngological pathology."

The sinusoidal frequency was randomly changed between 0.5, 0.33 and 0.25 Hz, while the amplitude of the deflection was constant (+/- 12 cm). During an adapted sinus, forward inclination of the body at the posterior turning point was associated with a slowly increasing tibialis anterior and decreasing gastrocnemius activity, while straightening of the body at the anterior turning point was associated with a sharply increasing gastrocnemius and decreasing tibialis anterior activity. The angle of forward inclination was greatest in the groups of children and was dependent upon both the sinus frequency and the child's height. The presumed programmed adjustment of the body inclination was such that the net effect of both inertial and gravitational forces acting on the body coincided approximately with the axis of the body at the posterior turning point. Changes of sinusoidal frequency were followed by compensatory responses, the amplitude of which depended upon the velocity of the body's displacement and the height of the subjects. In all three subject groups the response latencies were significantly shorter at the posterior turning point for the gastrocnemius response to a change from 0.5 to 0.25 Hz (105 ms for children and 119 ms for adults) than for the tibialis anterior response to a change from 0.25 to 0.5 Hz for which the values were 162 and 169 ms, respectively. This difference could be attributed to the forward inclination of the body at the posterior turning point which requires an earlier onset of compensatory extensor activity in order to maintain equilibrium. Adaptation to a new sinusoidal frequency occurred within 4 cycles following a change in sinus frequency. The phase shifts between treadmill position and the biomechanical and EMG signals that occurred during the adaptational process suggest that the position of the body's centre of gravity is the variable controlled by the programmed leg muscle activation. In young children the phase shifts during adaptation were absent, which may contribute to their greater instability. It is concluded that posture is continually adjusted in such a way that the resulting torque acting on the body during the treadmill movement becomes minimized. For this regulation load receptors in addition to the classical afferent impulses from visual, vestibular and muscle stretch receptors could play a major role."

  "title": "A postural model of balance-correcting movement strategies",
  "date": "1992 Winter",
  "abstract": "The patterns of joint torques and movement strategies underlying human balance corrections were examined using a postural model. Two types of support-surface perturbation, dorsiflexion rotation (ROT) and rearward translation (TRANS), were employed. These two perturbations were adjusted to produce similar profiles of ankle dorsiflexion in order to obtain information on the role of lower leg proprioceptive inputs on triggering balance corrections. In addition, the dependence of balance control on head angular and linear accelerations was investigated by comparing the responses of normal and vestibularly deficient subjects under eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. Differences in ROT and TRANS movement strategies were examined in three ways First, the amplitude and polarity of active joint torques were analysed. These were obtained by altering joint torques applied to a postural model until movements of the model accurately duplicated those of measured responses. Second, the pattern of body-segment angular movements depicted by stick figures moving in response to the computed joint torques was investigated. Third, the peak amplitude and patterns of crosscorrelations between joint torques were measured. Active ankle, knee, and hip joint torques computed for normal subjects rotated the body forward for ROT. In the case of TRANS, computed active torques in normals were of opposite polarity to those of ROT and reversed the forward motion of the body. Subjects with vestibular deficits had lower amplitude torques for ROT and failed to counter the platform rotation. Hip torques for TRANS in vestibular deficient subjects were of opposite polarity to those of normal subjects and resulted in excessive forward trunk rotation. Normally, neck torques acted to stabilize the head in space when trunk angular velocity peaked. Vestibular deficient subjects displayed head movements in response to ROT similar to those generated when neck torques were absent. For TRANS, these same subjects exhibited overcompensatory neck torques. Stick figures of normal responses indicated a stiffening of the body into a leg and a trunk-head link for ROT and a flexible multilink motion for TRANS. Likewise, normal response strategies, defined by using crosscorrelations of joint torques, differed for ROT and TRANS. All joint torque crosscorrelations were significant for TRANS. Neck torques led those of all other joint torques by 40 ms or more, and hip joint led ankle torques by 30 ms. Joint torque correlations for ROT were organised around hip and ankle torques without a major correlation to neck torques. Fundamental changes in all torque crosscorrelations occurred for vestibularly deficient subjects under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

  "date": "1992",
  "abstract": "Variations in natural head posture (NHP) and hyoid bone (HB) positioning impart changes in the size and shape of the pharyngeal airways. In SAS, which was shown to be correlated with detrimental craniofacial anatomical conditions, control of pharyngeal permeability is lost during sleep. The aim of this study was determine if functional adaptation of NHP and HB position to these detrimental conditions could be observed, using Bonferonni probabilities, in a cephalometric comparison of 38 SAS adults in the wakeful state and a control group of 38 healthy adults. Since HB relationships with craniofacial anatomical structures vary with the positioning of the head, the cephalograms were taken according to the preliminarily tested NHP, thus making the method reproducible. In SAS craniovertical angulation was unchanged, but the head was maintained in a forward position (increased cervico-vertical angulation, P < 0.001). Maintenance of an acceptable pharyngeal permeability was associated with a more distant positioning of HB from the cervical column (P < 0.01) and from craniofacial references (P < 0.001). In spite of these facts lower pharynx opening was still reduced (P < 0.05). Soft palate and facial divergence were expectedly increased in the apneic group. All the individuals but one control could be correctly reclassified with the help of soft palate length, facial divergence, and two HB related variables. Prevention of pharyngeal collapsibility in SAS seems to be commonly associated with functional adaptation of NHP and HP position. The precise control mechanisms of this adaptation remains to be elucidated. Skeletal predispositions to SAS do probably develop already during infancy."

  "date": "1991 Dec",
  "abstract": "In order to test the assumption of an association between the anatomy of the first cervical vertebra, the atlas, and dentofacial build, roentgen-cephalograms of 78 young adults with either a markedly high or a low atlas dorsal arch were analysed with regard to head posture, and cervicovertebral and dentofacial anatomy. The high and low dorsal arch groups each comprised 22 women and 17 men. The head was more extended in the low arch groups and particularly so among the women, in whose low arch group there was a tendency for the cervical spine to be inclined more forward. Both the dorsal arch and the dens of the second vertebra were vertically smaller in the low arch groups, and more so among the men. Vertebral length was reduced more in the women, however. The clival plane was more parallel to the foraminal plane in the low arch groups and the gonial angle was more obtuse. Furthermore, the women with low arches showed a steepened mandibular plane, a backward-rotated condylar head, a decrease in the ratio of posterior to anterior face height, smaller vertical overbite and reduced proclination of the lower incisors. The prevalence of severe malocclusions was higher than in the corresponding high arch group."

  "title": "Assessment of total head excursion and resting head posture",
  "date": "1991 Oct",
  "abstract": "Clinicians typically evaluate head posture and cervical range of motion in both standing and sitting positions. There are currently few quantitative data available regarding resting head posture (RHP) or total head excursion (THE), a retraction-protraction gliding range of head motion in the sagittal plane, and where the RHP lies within THE. The purposes of this study were to describe quick and simple methods to determine quantitative measurements of THE, RHP while sitting, and RHP while standing, to provide preliminary data on these postural measurements for men and women in four age categories; and to determine the effects of gender and age on these measurements. Subjects included 218 able-bodied adults. Measurements of THE, RHP while sitting, and RHP while standing were taken. A two-way multivariate analysis of variance followed by two-way analyses of variance showed only the main effect of gender to be significant (p less than .05) for each of the dependent measurements. Across the age groups, men had a greater excursion distance from retraction to protraction than women. Within THE, women held their heads more forward than men. Men held their heads farther from the vertical than women while standing. These results indicate that normal head and neck posture is different for men and women and should not be judged by the same standard. The methods used in this study are clinically advantageous in that they produce objective, quantitative measurements of THE and RHP that may be obtained quickly and with minimal equipment."

The assessment is carried out in a practical and straight-forward manner, avoiding the measurement of angles. The visually determined Aesthetic Horizontal Line is used as the reference line, with more reliability than the Natural Head Position and more relevance to the soft tissues than Frankfort Horizontal. The analysis accurately predicts the correct position of the mandible so that the extent of orthopaedic or surgical correction necessary can be evaluated. The ideal position and angulation of the maxillary incisors are determined and established as treatment goals, to give optimal exposure of the dentition in expressive behaviour. Comparison of before and after treatment cephalograms permits quantitative assessment of aesthetic change."

  "date": "1991 Aug",
  "abstract": "A dynamic postural monitoring technique was developed and implemented to determine the effects of a forward-inclined seat base on the sitting posture of both normal children and children with mild spastic cerebal palsy. With the seat base tilted forward there was a significant increase in the distance between the top of head and the seat base, and an increase in the normalized erector spinae muscle activity for both the normal and cerebral palsy subjects. This increase represents a longitudinal straightening of the spine and consequent reduction in kyphotic posture. Sitting stability was significantly lower for children with cerebral palsy than for the normals. Data from this study reveal that an approximately 10° anterior seat tilt may be beneficial for children with cerebral palsy, affecting spinal elongation, reducing dynamic curvatures, and improving sitting stability."

  "date": "1991 Aug",
  "abstract": "Body sway in normal subjects was analyzed by means of various methods to study a role of cervical muscles in galvanic body sway test. Galvanic stimulation through the retro-auricular electrode induced an initial response and a deviation response in body sway. When the anodal stimulation was given through the right retro-auricle during standing, a deviation response toward the right side was observed. While keeping a posture weighted on one foot, the stimulation induced a similar response. The stimulation during squatting produced also a deviation response toward the right side. When the head was rotated to the right, the stimulation produced backward responses. When rotated to the left, it produced forward responses. Even without galvanic stimulation, similar responses were also induced by some other method, for example, inclining the head to one side. Galvanic stimulation while sitting resulted in slight but apparent head inclination. The results suggested that cervical muscles played an important role in galvanic body sway test. Initial and deviation responses appeared to be secondarily produced by changes in the cervical muscular tension."

  "abstract": "A forward head position and rounded shoulders have been implicated in the development or perpetuation of craniomandibular disorders. Since women seek treatment for these problems more frequently than men, postural differences may account for the increased incidence of symptoms in women. The purposes of this study were (1) to compare the sagittal head and shoulder posture of asymptomatic men and women and (2) to compare the posture of asymptomatic and symptomatic women to determine differences in sagittal plane posture. Subjects were 20 asymptomatic men and women volunteers and nine consecutive women patients presenting for evaluation and treatment of craniomandibular pain. The subjects were compared using a valid, reliable, computer-assisted slide digitizing system called the Postural Analysis Digitizing System (PADS). Asymptomatic men and women did not differ in the postural characteristics associated with craniomandibular disorders. Sagittal posture does not appear to be a gender-related factor in these disorders. Symptomatic women, however, do display these postural characteristics to a greater extent than asymptomatic women. Evaluation and treatment of postural dysfunction should be included in the management of these patients."

  "date": "1991 Jul",
  "abstract": "The central hypothesis of the work is that the dimension of control-no control plays an important role in motion sickness. Although it is generally agreed that having control over a moving vehicle greatly reduces the likelihood of motion sickness, few studies have addressed this issue directly, and the theoretical explanation for this phenomenon is not completely clear. In this study, we equated groups differing in controllability for head movement, vision, activity, and predictability, which have often been suggested in the literature as explanations for the driver's immunity to motion sickness. Twenty-two pairs of yoked subjects were exposed to nauseogenic rotation. One subject of each pair had control over the rotation and head movements, while the other was exposed passively to the same motion stimulus. Subjects who had control reported significantly fewer motion sickness symptoms and less of a decrement in their well-being, as compared to the yoked subject without control. The results are discussed in relation to Reason's sensory rearrangement theory and the concept of feed-forward mechanisms in motion perception."

  "abstract": "A review of the literature on the central nervous system (CNS) effects of repeated centrifuge acceleration studies involving G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) reveals that remarkably few adverse effects have been reported, aside from the G-LOC itself, even in subjects with numerous exposures. However, most of the followup studies were performed before the availability of sophisticated neuropsychological tests and non-invasive means of imaging the CNS, such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), brain electrical activity measurement (BEAM), and positron emission tomography (PET). Further, only a handful of long-term followup studies have been done. Thus, although repeated G-LOC may have induced some long-term adverse CNS effects, either organic or functional, little has been done to detect them. Even granted that some damage may be done, this risk must be weighed against the risk of aviators of similar damage from high +Gz exposures in flight, and even more against the risk of fatal G-LOC aircraft accidents. Volunteers for centrifuge acceleration studies should be fully informed about what is known and not known in this regard. As an ancillary measure, head restraints may be useful in avoiding postural trauma to the cervical spine, or impact injury to the head when G-LOC occurs and the head snaps forward and down."

Time moment is a descriptive term calculated from a formula that considers both spatial (where contacts are) and temporal (when contact occurs) aspects of tooth contact and provides a quantitative basis for comparing the dynamics of tooth contact. Paired head positions were analyzed for differences using Student's t test, and it appears that in healthy young adults, initial tooth contacts are substantially influenced by posture."

No significant differences were found in the nasionsella (SN) plane, Frankfort horizontal (FH) plane or palatal planes between male and female subjects. The SN plane was found to be located at 7.26 degrees above the true horizontal on the average, and the FH plane differed on the average 1.92 degrees from the true horizontal with the line diverging forward and upward. The palatal plane was found to be located in a downward and forward direction at 1.17 degrees from the true horizontal plane on the average. The orbitale (Or) was found to be located at 2.34 mm on the average above the true horizontal plane depicted from the porion (Po) in this study, which implies that the racial characteristic of a high zygomatic bone in Chinese may have some influence upon the position of Or, and this should be taken into consideration when the FH plane is used as the true horizontal during face bow transfer. The mandibular plane (MP) angle, occlusal plane (OP) angle and the gonial angle (GA) of males were found to be smaller than those of females, with a significant difference at the level of P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.01, respectively. The upper facial divergent angles of males and females were quite similar, as reflected by the similarity in the SN-FH angles and SN-PP angles between the sexes A significant difference was found to exist in the lower facial divergent angles between males and females. The SN-MP angle, PP-OP angle and PP-MP angle were all significantly smaller in males, with a P less than 0.001. The OP-MP angle was also smaller in males with P less than 0.05."

  "date": "1991",
  "abstract": "The contribution of the maculo-ocular reflex to gaze stability was studied in 10 pigmented rabbits by rolling the animals at various angles of sagittal inclination of the rotation and/or longitudinal animal axes. At low frequencies (0.005-0.01 Hz) of sinusoidal stimulation the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) was due to macular activation, while at intermediate and high frequencies it was mainly due to ampullar activation. The following results were obtained: 1) maculo-ocular reflex gain decreased as a function of the cosine of the angle between the rotation axis and the earth's horizontal plane. No change in gain was observed when longitudinal animal axis alone was inclined. 2) At 0 degrees of rotation axis and with the animal's longitudinal axis inclination also set at 0 degrees, the maculo-ocular reflex was oriented about 20 degrees forward and upward with respect to the earth's vertical axis. This orientation remained constant with sagittal inclinations of the rotation and/or longitudinal animal axes ranging from approximately 5 degrees upward to 30 degrees downward. When the longitudinal animal axis was inclined beyond these limits, the eye trajectory tended to follow the axis inclination. In the upside down position, the maculo-ocular reflex was anticompensatory, oblique and fixed with respect to orbital coordinates. 3) Ampullo-ocular reflex gain did not change with inclinations of the rotation and/or longitudinal animal axes. The ocular responses were consistently oriented to the stimulus plane. At intermediate frequencies the eye movement trajectory was elliptic because of directional differences between the ampullo- and maculo-ocular reflexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We investigated the influence of the gravity vector on the otolithic-ocular reflex caused by motion in normal subjects. The sled type linear accelerator, moving back and forth with a frequency of 0.25 Hz and an amplitude of 2 m, generated right-left linear acceleration with a maximum magnitude of 0.5 g. We tested every subject under seven different postures: 1) 135 degrees forward tilted (F.T.), 2) 90 degrees F.T., 3) 45 degrees F.T., 4) upright sitting, 5) 45 degrees backward tilted (B.T.), 6) 90 degrees B.T., and 7) 135 degrees B.T. Horizontal eye movements with nystagmic pattern were elicited by these stimulations and were recorded by EOG. The eye movement data were analyzed by using a computer with the following procedure. After extraction of saccadic components from the data, the remaining parts were connected smoothly. The waves reconstructed in this manner, considered to be primary otolithic-ocular responses, were processed with the FFT method for calculating the amplitude of the component at 0.25 Hz. As a result, the responses were larger in the forward tilted postures than in the backward tilted postures."

Two sources of light placed at eye level indicated the side on which the movement was to be performed. Two populations were compared: naive subjects and dancers. Two control strategies were identified. An \"inclination\" strategy was used by the naive subjects. This consisted of an external rotation of the body around the antero-posterior ankle joint axis; a counter-rotation of the head with respect to the trunk was observed, which ensured some stabilization in the horizontal plane of the interorbital line. A \"translation\" strategy was used by the dancers. Here the external rotation of the leg around the ankle joint was associated with a feed-forward counter-rotation of the trunk around the coxofemoral joint so that the horizontality of the interorbital line and the verticality of the trunk axis were maintained. This new coordination results from a long-term training and indicates that a new motor program has been elaborated."

Our measurements show that the coordination of eye and head movements during gaze shifts within +/- 25 deg relative to the forward direction is organized by restricting the rotatory trajectories of the two systems to almost parallel planes. These so-called \"Listing planes\" for eye-in-space and head-in-space rotations are workspace-oriented, not body-fixed. Eye and head trajectories in their respective planes are closely related in direction and amplitude. For pointing or grasping, the rotatory trajectories of the arm are also restricted to a workspace-oriented Listing plane. During visually guided movements, arm follows gaze, and the nine-dimensional rotatory configuration space for eye-head-arm-synergies (three degrees of freedom for each system) is reduced to a two-dimensional plane in the space of quaternion vectors."

An ethological method has been used to describe the \"overall\" spontaneous behaviour of astronauts as seen from video recordings made during Space Flights. The work has consisted in analysing the relationships between orientation, movement and posture as an indication of a motor adaptative reorganization in such a situation. The results obtained lead us to consider three different aspects: (1) Orientation references. The astronaut orientates himself with reference to the Space Shuttle's internal structure; the increase of visual activity confirms the choice of the retinal vertical as frame of reference. (2) Motor coordination. The main data reveals a decrease in motor stereotypes by the diversity of motor acts observed and the importance of the link between orientation and posture described as follows: slightly inclined forward position, with legs flexed at about 135 degrees. (3) Cognitive references. There appears to be a new organization of the cognitive image of the body scheme, the missing vestibular information being supplied by peripheral vision instead which could play a role in the astronaut's perception of his own movement."

  "date": "1990 Feb",
  "abstract": "Toe-up or toe-down tilts of a platform on which a subject stands induce early EMG responses in the leg muscles initially stretched by the perturbation and late responses in the antagonist muscles. Early responses are thought to be connected with the stretch of the leg muscle in which they appear. Disagreement exists as to the origin of the late responses occurring in the antagonist muscle. The aims of this study were to assess (1) whether the late responses are induced by afferent volleys from the spindles of the muscle stretched by the initial perturbation, or (2) whether they are connected with the induced overall postural imbalance, and (3) whether the postural set may influence the occurrence of the late responses. Subjects standing on a platform underwent randomized perturbations stretching the soleus (Sol) muscle (upward tilts and backward translations) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles (downward tilts and forward translations). The platform movement was regulated in order to yield changes in ankle angle of similar extent and velocity during both tilt and translation. Surface EMGs of Sol and TA were recorded bilaterally. An optoelectronic device detected the movements of markers fixed on the body. From these data, movements of the head, and changes in hip, knee and ankle angles, along with variations in the length of Sol, gastrocnemii (Gas) and TA were computed. Both tilts and translations, equally stretching Sol or TA, induced similar early responses in the stretched muscle. Consistent late responses in the antagonist muscle (antagonist reactions, ARs) were induced only by tilts. In spite of similar changes in ankle angles, the most striking differences in body movements between tilts and translations stretching the same leg muscle concerned changes in knee angles and Gas length. Slight differences were also seen in vertical head movements. Standing and holding onto a frame strongly decreased the amplitude and the frequency of occurrence of both early responses and ARs only in the TA muscle, while all Sol responses were not affected. This modulation of TA responses occurred in spite of changes in ankle angle and head movements similar to those occurring under the free-standing condition. It was concluded that early EMG responses are connected with the stretch of the muscle induced by the platform movement. The ARs, on the other hand, appear to be related to the type of overall postural imbalance. The absence of ARs during translations suggests a role in these responses of the afferences from the joint and muscles of the lower limb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

  "abstract": "In this study, posture is studied in the context of neuro-otological problems. In the several chapters, postural elements, postural influence upon balance aspects as well as postural components of the balance function in normal and pathological conditions are emphasized. Two main applications are put forward: rehabilitation by postural treatment techniques (REHAB) and examination techniques for the vestibulospinal aspects (posturography--PG). I. Balance function Balance is provided by automatic reflexes for stabilization of the visual field (vestibulo-ocular reflex--VOR) and for a correct posture, erect standing (vestibulo-spinal reflex--VSR) and head position (vestibulo-collic reflex--VCR). The fundamental characteristics of these reflexes are described, especially of those related to posture. The reflexes are elaborated on the basis of sensory inputs that inform about changed relations to space and environment, provided by visual, vestibular and proprioceptive systems. The sensory signals are further processed by the centers to adequate reflexes and to some extent to a conscious awareness. II. Dysfunction and adaptation Dysfunction in the balance mechanisms leads to erroneous reflexes, but most importantly to frightening sensations of vertigo. The peripheral disturbances produce a sensory mismatch which is the primum movens of vertigo. Built-in adaptive mechanisms cope with this disturbance and restore global balance function. The mechanisms involved have been studied as vestibular compensation and habituation, VOR-reflex plasticity and sensory \"substitutive\" compensation. The mechanisms are set into action by the dysfunctional situation and constitute an error-controlled process. Emphasis is laid upon the items related to rehabilitation treatment and posturography. A survey of clinical entities of vestibular peripheral dysfunction is included. III. Examination techniques The logical approach to the patient with vertigo consists in an analysis of the complaints pattern, correlation of it with the dysfunctional state revealed by clinical observation, and functional tests of balance. Correct interpretation of the test results is a pre-requisite. Postural aspects of these examination techniques, especially posturography, are put into evidence in this review. The strategy used in the department is sketched. IV. Contribution of the examination techniques: functional evaluation results The several data obtained by each examination technique are discussed within the scope of the experiences in the department. Data from the literature and from personal experience, especially interpreted in the context of rehabilitation and posturography, are analysed. V. Reh"

Philogenetically and ontogenetically, its appearance reflects the adaptation of the mandible of mammals to the morphologic and functional changes that took place in their cephalic skeleton (more erect posture, more vigorous mastication). Its chief role in man is to stabilize the mandibular body and to allow it to be properly mobilized, although contributing also to its forward and downward movements (namely in its posterior aspect). As such, it plays an active role in mandibular growth, and this role varies according to the primary \"potential\" of the condylar cartilage. Such primary-type potential for condylar growth may be adequately assessed by studying the shape of the mandible, as well as through an analysis of craniofacial architecture. Most of the conventional diagrams depicting mandibular growth are defective. Another figurative system has to be innovated, that will differentiate each skeletal unit--body, condyle, coronoid process, angle, alveolodental arch--, the sum of which confers the shape, the size, and the multiple variations to the mandible as a whole."

  "title": "Effect of head orientation on human postural stability following unilateral vestibular ablation",
  "date": "1990",
  "abstract": "Effective interpretation of vestibular inputs to postural control requires that orientation of head on body is known. Postural stability might deteriorate when vestibular information and neck information are not properly coupled, as might occur with vestibular pathology. Postural sway was assessed in unilateral vestibulopathic patients before and acutely, 1, 4, and 18+ months after unilateral vestibular ablation (UVA) as well as in normal subjects. Postural equilibrium with eyes closed was quantified as scaled pk-pk sway during 20 s trials in which the support surface was modulated proportionally with sway. Subjects were tested with the head upright and facing forward, turned 45 degrees right, and 45 degrees left. Equilibrium was uninfluenced by head orientation in normal subjects. In contrast, patients after UVA showed both a general reduction in stability and a right/left head orientation-dependent asymmetry. These abnormalities adaptively recovered with time. It is concluded that vestibular inputs to postural control are interpreted within a sensory-motor context of head-on-body orientation."

  "date": "1989 Dec 25",
  "abstract": "Locomotor behaviors evoked by stimulating the hypothalamus and the brainstem were studied in freely moving, awake cats. To do this, stimulating microelectrodes were chronically implanted into the subthalamic locomotor region (SLR) in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) corresponding to the nucleus cuneiformis, the dorsal tegmental field (DTF) and the ventral tegmental field (VTF) of caudal pons along its midline. After recovery from surgery (2-3 days), open field tests were performed to study stimulus effects upon posture and locomotor movements. The stimuli consisted of pulses of 0.2 ms duration of less than 80 microA delivered at 50 pulses/s for 5-20 s. DTF stimulation resulted in suppression of postural support by the hindlimbs. When the cat was in a standing posture, DTF stimulation simply resulted in a sequential alteration of posture to a squatting and then to a final lying posture. In contrast, VTF stimulation evoked an almost opposite series of postural changes to those induced by DTF stimulation. With VTF stimulation, the cat changed from a lying or a squatting position, and then started to walk during continuation of the stimulation. With MLR stimulation, the cat invariably exhibited fast walking and then running movements. It ran straight forward, avoiding collision with walls or other obstacles, and even tried to jump over a fence placed in front of it. With LHA stimulation, the cat started to walk slowly extending its head forward and looking around repeatedly. It tended to walk with a stoop and stealthy steps along the corners of the room. Induced postural and locomotor changes were always accompanied by behavioral arousal reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

  "title": "Seemingly paradoxical jumping in cataleptic haloperidol-treated rats is triggered by postural instability",
  "date": "1989 Dec 1",
  "abstract": "Paradoxically, animals exhibiting haloperidol-induced cataleptic immobility can be induced to leap vigorously, by pushing them forward from behind. It is shown here that such jumping can also be produced by placing them on a board and tilting it tail-end upward until about 50 degrees above horizontal. In both situations, jumps only occurred when the animal's hindlegs began to slip forward, as they lost their postural stability. As alternatives to jumping from the slope, rats turned to face upwards (negative geotaxis), or adopted a spread-eagled posture during head-first downward sliding, with the body and head flattened against the substrate. All 3 responses to the sloping board were present in some undrugged rats. Such rats, and those given low doses of haloperidol (0.5, 1.0 mg/kg), were more likely to turn upwards than to jump or slide. At high doses (7.5, 10.0 mg/kg), they were more likely to slide downward than to turn or jump. Jumping was most likely to occur at an intermediate dose (5 mg/kg), approximately 60 min after injection. We suggest that in the absence of haloperidol, and at low doses, locomotion is dominant over reflexes defending static equilibrium, and hence rats are more likely to turn upwards (which involves stepping). In contrast, at higher doses, locomotion is more fully suppressed, reducing the likelihood of turning. At very high doses of haloperidol and later in the action of the drug, muscle tonus appears to be weakened, reducing the likelihood of jumping. This possibility was supported by the finding that combined injection of the optimal dose of haloperidol and 2 mg/kg diazepam reduced the ability to cling vertically (suggesting weakness of muscle tone). In such rats, jumping from the sloping board was decreased, and active downward sliding was increased. Thus, different factors influence the occurrence of jumping at different doses of haloperidol. However, these are all active defensive responses to postural instability, and hence are similar to the other reflexes used by haloperidol-treated rats to defend against displacement from static stable equilibrium, such as standing immobile, bracing, clinging, and righting. Jumping in response to loss of stability on the sloping board also occasionally occurred in undrugged rats. Unlike jumps by haloperidol-treated rats, those by undrugged animals only occurred when they could be directed to a safe landing place. Thus, if the board faced the edge of the table, so that the jump would carry the animal into space over the edge, undrugged rats either did not jump or jumped off the side of the board onto the table.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

  "date": "1989 Oct",
  "abstract": "An otolith disorder is described in a patient with a subluxed stapes footplate. Otoneurological examination, including tympanoscopy, showed that nonphysiological mechanical stimulation of the otoliths by a (pathologically) hypermobile stapes footplate typically manifests with a pattern of sound-induced paroxysms of ocular tilt reaction (OTR), oscillopsia and postural imbalance (otolith Tullio phenomenon). The rare condition of sound-induced otolithic stimulation in an otherwise healthy young man offered a unique opportunity to investigate otolith reflex control of the eye, head and posture in man. Electro-oculographic recordings and special video analysis (time resolution: 1000 images/s) revealed an initial rapid and phasic counterclockwise rotatory upward deviation with a latency of 22 ms, followed by a smaller tonic effect which lasted as long as sound stimulation (480 +/- 20 Hz, 95 dB A). Latencies of the otolithic vestibulospinal reflex, recorded using surface EMG during upright stance with the eyes closed, were surprisingly short with activation of the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle 47 ms after the stimulus, and of the ipsilateral gastrocnemius muscle after 52 ms. A considerable postural pertubation was measured by means of a Kistler platform, with the shortest latency for displacement of the centre of pressure of 80 ms and a preferred body sway direction from right-backward to left-forward. When the Valsalva manoeuvre was performed, tonic eye movements and oscillopsia were induced opposite in direction to those produced by the sound reflecting a push-and-pull deviation of the otoliths."

  "title": "The benefit of head rotation on pharyngoesophageal dysphagia",
  "date": "1989 Oct",
  "abstract": "This study examined the effect of head rotation on the mechanics of swallowing in healthy subjects, as well as the effects of this postural change on the oropharyngeal swallow of five patients with lateral medullary syndrome (LMS). Videofluoroscopic studies of swallowing in the normal subjects revealed that head rotation to either side increased upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening diameter by an average of 2mm without affecting the period of UES opening or the oropharyngeal transit time. Maximal rotation of the head to the right or left caused the bolus to lateralize away from the direction of rotation, and also caused a significant (18mmHg or 35%) fall in UES pressure. In the face forward position, the LMS patients exhibited barium residue in the pharynx and pyriform sinuses, as well as diminished UES opening diameter. The fraction of the bolus swallowed and the UES opening diameter increased significantly with the head turned toward the paretic side in the LMS patients. We conclude that head rotation can improve swallowing in patients with unilateral oropharyngeal dysphagia. Two potentially beneficial effects were observed: (1) functional exclusion of the relatively flaccid, weakened pharyngeal wall, and (2) reduced UES tone. Which of these mechanisms is operative probably depends on the dominant mechanisms of dysphagia. In individuals with substantial impairment of UES opening, head turning reduces the resistance of the sphincter that must be overcome by pharyngeal contraction. In individuals with a flaccid hemipharynx, which dissipates pharyngeal pressure, head rotation excludes these structures from the bolus path and allows pharyngeal pressure to be directed at the UES."

  "date": "1989 Oct",
  "abstract": "Forward head posture has long since been associated with a number of clinical problems treated by the fields of physical therapy and dentistry. The consistent and longstanding difficulty in the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions has been a lack of a clear understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical conditions that underly forward head posture. It has been reported that there is a narrowing of the cervical interspaces in forward head posture with the greatest change being between C4-5 and C5-6. These observations were made by viewing lateral radiographic films, yet the size of the foramina can only be viewed using oblique views. This study used oblique radiographic views of the intervertebral foramina to determine if there is a difference in the size of the intervertebral foramina in the forward head posture versus the normal head posture. The intervertebral foramina of the cervical vertebra were found to be larger in the forward head posture from levels C3 to T1. These results conflict with previous observations, suggesting that additional research is needed to assist in determining the underlying mechanisms responsible for the pain associated with forward head posture."

  "abstract": "One of the most common symptoms in sinusitis is pain over the infected cavity increasing when the patient is bending forward or lying down. It is commonly thought that this increase in pain is a result of increased pressure in the paranasal cavities when bending forward. In this investigation we have found that changing the body position from sitting to recumbent or even to \"head between knees\" gives a manometrical pressure rise in the sinus that is too small to cause a pressure-mediated pain. The pain is probably caused by a dilation in the blood vessels of the infected mucosa when the patient is bending forward or lying down."

The patients varied in age from 25 to 58 with a median average of 48 years. Fifteen demonstrated radiographic evidence of cervical degenerative disc disease and in an additional four, electromyographic evidence of cervical root compromise was present. Multiple precipitating factors were identified in Monday's headache including the predisposing presence of unrecognized impairment of visual acuity in 4 and cervical radiculopathy in 16. Mechanically, prolonged postural cervical hyperextension frequently combined with repetitive head rotation appeared to trigger the discomfort complaints. Undue elevation of the CRT screen, prolonged copying of laterally displaced hard copy, the wearing of bifocals, as well as seating either excessively soft or with a tendency to pitch the operator forward were identified as additional aggravating factors."

  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of handlebar height, during cycling, on the cervical and thoracic spine postures and on the load moment about the bilateral axis of C7-T1 induced by the weight of the head-and-neck. Data were collected from eight male subjects (24-34 years) using those parts of the ENOCH system that consist of a minicomputer and an opto-electronic device (Selspot) for collecting kinematic data. Light-emitting diode markers were attached to a set-square on a helmet, and to the skin. The subject cycled on a bicycle ergometer using three different handlebar positions. A Selspot camera observed all the markers during 50 samples at 315 Hz. The relative angles for the upper -and lower-cervical spine and the vertical inclination of the upper thoracic spine were included in the analysis. The lever arm of the head-and-neck was also calculated. The results show that the forward inclination of the trunk required when lower handlebars were used did not affect lumbar lordosis or thoracic kyphosis, but gave increased extension of the upper-cervical spine. The use of racing handlebars induced a flexing load moment about the bilateral motion axis of the lower-cervical-upper-thoracic motion segment (C7-T1) three times that in a vertical sitting position. Thus, high handlebars are to be recommended, particularly if the cyclist normally experiences discomfort during extension of the cervical spine. High handlebars reduce the load on the lower cervical spine and decrease the risk of maintained cervical spine extended positions."

The stimulation was applied using a bipolar-biaural method with the cathode on the right ear and the anode on the left ear. The intensity was 1 mA and duration 3 s. 1) When the labyrinth was stimulated with the head facing forward, soleus muscle activities increased on the right side and decreased on the left, with a latency of about 100 ms. In spite of the same stimulation, activities of the soleus muscle on both sides decreased with the head rotated to the right and increased with the head rotated to the left. 2) The responses in upper-body rotation were the same as in the case of head rotation. 3) In trunk rotation, some cases showed the same responses as with the trunk facing forward in rotation to the right and left, while others showed changes in muscular activities with the head rotation caused by rotating the trunk. 4) Changes in labyrinthine evoked EMG by head and trunk positions were considered to be due to interaction of vestibular and proprioceptive inputs on the interneurons of the spinal cord."

The forward-backward sway was found to have a fast, hidden periodicity, composed of sways due to a loss of the labyrinthine righting reflex upon the head and interaction between the head and knee sways. Furthermore, on the basis of our previous investigation, the forward-backward sway was found to depend on the increased spinal reflexes caused by a loss of labyrinthine inhibitory control upon the antigravity muscles. The right-left sway is slow and irregular, being mainly produced by disturbance of the head righting reflex."

  "abstract": "Compensatory electromyographic (EMG) responses and several biomechanical parameters were studied following impulsive disturbance of the limbs during stance of human volunteers on a treadmill. Treadmill acceleration impulses were backwards or forwards directed, or their initial direction was reversed after 30 ms. Backwards directed impulses were followed by gastrocnemius, forwards directed ones by tibialis anterior EMG responses (latency 65 to 75 ms) whose durations depended on impulse duration. When the direction of the impulse was reversed, the respective antagonistic leg muscles were activated again with a delay of 68 to 75 ms after onset of stretch of these muscles. The behaviour of the EMG responses could best be correlated to the displacement at the ankle joint and may be described in terms of a stretch reflex response. The results indicate that these stretch reflex responses help control of the body's centre of gravity thereby preventing falling. Head movements induced by the impulses showed little correlation with the appearance of the EMG responses, suggesting that the vestibular system is unlikely to be directly involved in the generation of these responses. Vestibular signals may, however, significantly contribute to slow body sway stabilization."

  "date": "1988 Dec 19",
  "abstract": "An experiment was designed to evaluate the vestibular contribution to the stabilization of upright stance in normals and in two patients with loss of vestibular function. A forward or backward displacement of a load (2 kg) by a torque motor attached to the subject induced opposing movements in the head and trunk. The small linear acceleration of the head in space of about 0.1 g was followed, with a latency of 50-65 ms, by EMG responses in the tibialis anterior and rectus femoris (backward acceleration) or gastrocnemius muscles (forward acceleration). These responses were absent in patients with a vestibular deficit. It is suggested that the observed EMG responses are due to fast acting vestibulospinal reflexes involved in the regulation of upright stance. For comparable head accelerations the integrated EMG responses induced by the vestibulospinal mechanism are about ten times smaller than those induced by spinal stretch reflexes during displacement of the feet. Vestibulospinal reflexes would appear, therefore, to play only a minor role in the compensation of stumbling."

Finally, subjective acceptability was rated by a 5-point scale. Posture effects of the Balans® chair, taken in relation to the tiltable chair, were primarily a forward tilt of the pelvis and a change toward lumbar lordosis. Secondly, the trunk was vertical compared to the slightly backward-inclined position in the tiltable chair. The head was most vertical in the Balans® chair. No effect on spinal shrinkage or pulse was observed. The subjective rating seemed to favour the tiltable chair if used over longer periods. However, the Balans(®) chair may be a good alternative for some seated periods and special tasks."

When the mandible was advanced by sagittal split osteotomy, resting pressure did not increase as expected, but there was a tendency for incisors to become more upright after fixation release, perhaps as a rebound from labial tipping in fixation.

  "date": "1988",
  "abstract": "1. Optokinetic nystagmus was elicited in alert monkeys by movement of the visual surround in their horizontal or yaw plane, and optokinetic after-nystagmus was recorded in darkness. The animals were upright or were statically tilted at various angles from the upright. While upright, the OKAN was horizontal, and there were no vertical or roll components. When animals were tilted to either side or forward or back, vertical or roll components appeared both in the primary and secondary OKAN. Such components were also observed during nystagmus and after-nystagmus induced by electrical stimulation of the nucleus of the optic tract. The characteristics of the cross-coupled components indicated that they were mediated through the velocity storage mechanism in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. 2. A principle was inferred that explained the appearance of cross-coupled vertical or roll components in the primary and secondary OKAN: With the animal in a tilted position, a vector of eye velocity during OKN along the body-vertical axis was converted during primary OKAN toward a spatial-vertical axis with the same sense by a right hand rule. Thus, slow phase velocity along a vector toward the top of the animal's head during horizontal OKN rotated so that it tended to be directed spatially upward during primary OKAN. The reverse was true for OKN with a velocity vector directed toward the animal's feet. It rotated during primary OKAN so that it tended to be aligned with the direction of gravity. The vector of velocity during secondary OKAN was opposite to the direction of the vector during primary OKAN and was approximately aligned with spatial vertical. 3. OKN and OKAN were elicited about the animal's pitch and roll axes while they were upright and statically tilted at various angles away from the spatial vertical. There was a graded increase in the strength of vertical and roll OKN and OKAN and in the falling time constant of OKAN as the animals were tilted so that the axis of pitch or roll eye movements was moved toward alignment with the spatial vertical. Thus, velocity storage during pure vertical and roll nystagmus was similar to that during yaw OKN and OKAN in tilted positions: it was maximal along the pitch and roll axes when these axes were aligned with gravity. 4. The data indicate that the gravitational field is of fundamental importance in imposing a spatial reference onto the velocity storage integrator.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Tests were conducted with sources located in the subject's forward field (an arc extending from 60 degrees to the subject's right to 60 degrees to the left). Localization performance was determined under both monaural and binaural listening conditions, using both brief pulses and sustained pulse trains as target signals. Not unexpectedly, the ability to orient the face to a hidden sound source was very poor under monaural conditions if the listener received only a brief (100-ms) tonal pulse. When continuous pulse trains were employed, localization, even under monaural conditions, became quite accurate. Across conditions, this complex motor response produced results in agreement with those that have been obtained when subjects were only required to report their spatial impressions. In particular, performance with binaural pulse trains was observed to vary as a function of the frequency of the target signals employed. Descriptions of the head movement response, along with a discussion of some of the implications of ear-head coordination, are presented."

  "date": "1987 Sep",
  "abstract": "The perception of the subjective body orientation with respect to a foot reference basis, and the adaptation of mental image rotation have been investigated before, during, and after a 7-d spaceflight. The findings show that the body is tilted forward in darkness and in stabilized vision, which indicates a predominant role of vision in such orientational tasks performed in microgravity. Furthermore, perception of head angular rotation in pitch and roll axes seems to be altered in microgravity, whereas head displacements in yaw are estimated correctly. Subjects' capability to rotate mentally the image of the visual environment increased during the flight. Memorized writing was affected in microgravity, especially concerning the layout of letters corresponding to the vertical direction."

  "title": "Regional differences in the cat caudate nucleus as to the effectiveness in inducing contraversive head-turning by electrical stimulation",
  "date": "1987 Aug",
  "abstract": "An attempt was made to re-examine regional differences in the cat caudate nucleus as to the effectiveness in inducing contraversive head-turning by electrical stimulation and to analyze the time course of head-turning quantitatively. In 5 of the total 9 cats, the right sensorimotor cortex and its surrounding areas had been ablated chronically. While the awake, unrestrained cat maintained a stable standing posture facing forward, stimulation was applied systematically to various points in and around the caudate nucleus with a movable stimulating electrode. Trains of stimulating current pulses of less than 300 microA were given, mostly at a rate of 100 Hz for 5 s. In most experiments in which stimulation was given to the side of the intact cerebral cortex, stimulation of caudal portions of the head of the caudate nucleus was effective in inducing contraversive head-turning, but that of its rostral portions was ineffective. In experiments on the side of chronic cortical ablation, similar results were obtained. These results suggested that head-turning induced by stimulation of the caudate nucleus was brought about not by the activation of the corticofugal fibers from these cortical areas by a current spreading to the internal capsule, but by the activation of caudate neurons. Hence, it was demonstrated that there were regional differences in the cat caudate nucleus as to the effectiveness in inducing head-turning. The mean of the shortest latencies of the onset of head-turning for individual stimulation points was 396 ms (S.D., 210 ms) for the side of the intact cerebral cortex, and 454 ms (S.D., 289 ms) for the side of the cortical ablation. Statistically, there was no significant difference between them. Therefore, it was further revealed that the elimination of the sensorimotor cortex did not affect the caudate-induced head-turning in terms of the latency of its onset."

  "title": "Testing the vestibular-ocular reflexes: abnormalities of the otolith contribution in patients with neuro-otological disease",
  "date": "1987 Aug",
  "abstract": "Conventional vestibular rotation testing with the head centered on the axis stimulates the semicircular canals evoking compensatory eye movements. If the head is placed forwards of the axis in an eccentric position the otoliths are also stimulated by a tangential linear acceleration acting laterally to the skull. In normal subjects the additional otolithic stimulus evokes compensatory eye movements with a higher gain than with head centred, particularly for high frequency (greater than 0.1 Hz) stimuli. The responses with head centred and eccentric in various patients with known/suspected neuro-otological abnormalities have been compared. Patients with vestibular neurinectomies who have asymmetrical head centred responses showed greater asymmetry with head eccentric at higher stimulus frequencies. Some patients with cerebellar lesions showed abnormally enhanced or depressed and asymmetrical responses with head eccentric in comparison with head centred responses, which could be normal. The enhancing effects could be specific to low frequency stimuli. All patients who showed abnormal responses with head eccentric also had positional nystagmus provoked by the gravity acceleration vector when the head was tilted laterally. The direction of the positional nystagmus with respect to the gravity vector was not necessarily the same as the direction of the effect on eye movements of lateral acceleration during eccentric oscillation. Patients with benign paroxysmal vertigo or chronic linear vertigo in whom otolithic abnormalities are suspected were not found to have abnormal responses with head eccentric. We conclude that this method of testing may be useful in elucidating pathophysiology but is not a decisive clinical test for the presence of disordered otolith function."

  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to measure the strain on the brachial plexus that results from traction loads applied at various arm positions and to correlate this with visibility through the arthroscope. We mounted strain gauges to the upper trunk, lateral cord, median nerve, and radial nerve of five fresh human cadavers. Each cadaver was placed in a lateral decubitus position, with the head fixed in a neutral position, as for shoulder arthroscopy, and the strain on the plexus was measured as a function of arm position and traction load. A final cadaver was used to determine the accessibility and visibility in the arthroscope at each of the arm positions. At a given flexion angle, increasing abduction is associated with decreasing strain. At a given abduction angle, increasing flexion results in decreased strain. The minimum overall strain was noted at 90 degrees of flexion and 0 degree of abduction. Visibility at this position is limited. We conclude that the ideal arthroscopic position is a combination of two positions that would maximize visibility while minimizing strain to the nerves. These two positions are 45 degrees of forward flexion and 90 degrees of abduction in combination with 45 degrees of forward flexion and 0 degree of abduction."

  "title": "Forward and backward axial synergies in man",
  "date": "1987",
  "abstract": "Upper trunk and head forward and backward movements were analyzed in human subjects standing on a force platform. EMG of several flexor and extensor muscles was recorded together with the kinematics of the movement (EL.I.TE. system). It was found that upper trunk movements are accompanied by movements of hip and knees in the opposite direction, resulting in a slight displacement of the center of gravity projection on the ground. In fast movements, all the body segments were displaced at the same time, which suggests a feedforward control, whereas in slow movements, onset of displacement of the body segments was found to take place sequentially in a cranio-caudal direction. EMG analysis during fast movements revealed two different types of control, utilized in forward and backward movements. With forward bending movements the action of two sets of muscles could be recognized: the prime mover (R. Abd.), the activation of which was not correlated with that of the other muscles and preceded the onset of movement with a fairly constant lead, and a group of postural muscles, the activation (VM, TA) and inhibition (Sol) of which were closely correlated. By contrast, with backward movements, the prime mover (Er.S.) and the postural leg muscles (Hamstrings, Sol) were activated simultaneously. In both cases, a feedforward type of control is evident. Performance of the fast forward movements was accompanied by an initial forward displacement of the knee. The function of this phenomenon is discussed in term of a destabilizing action favouring the forward bending of the body or a prestretching of the knee extensor muscles increasing the strength of their subsequent contraction."

  "title": "Suprahyoid biomechanics and head posture. An electromyographic, videofluorographic and dynamographic study of hyo-mandibular function in man",
  "date": "1987",
  "abstract": "Suprahyoid and masseter muscle function was studied in 49 adult males with normal dentofacial morphology and normal soft tissue profiles, with special reference to head posture. The different parameters were investigated by EMG during chewing, by EMG synchronized to an opening force dynamograph during static and dynamic conditions, and by EMG synchronized to videofluorography during the open-close-clench cycle. Cephalometry was applied to evaluate the videofluorographic images of the hyo-mandibular complex. The EMG amplitude for the entire group did not vary significantly between different test occasions with an interval of 5-24 hours. The individual variation was large, however. Repeated EMG registrations within such time intervals should therefore be reliable for groups of individuals. Hook electrodes gave about 10% higher maximal EMG compared to surface electrodes. Registrations with the two types of electrodes could therefore not be directly compared. An increased interelectrode distance resulted in larger EMG amplitudes. The interelectrode distance should therefore be standardized. Head posture influenced the EMG amplitude and should therefore also be standardized. The electrical activity in suprahyoid muscle contraction preceded the mechanical activity. During opening, a time- lag of approximately 200 msec was found between the peak EMG activity of the anterior belly of the digastric muscle and the maximal opening force. A direct correlation existed between the IEMG activity of the digastric muscle and force during static (r = 0.89) and dynamic (r = 0.72) conditions. The maximal recorded force of the opening muscles of the mandible was found to be 70 N. No absolute reciprocity existed between opening and closing EMG activity. During chewing, suprahyoid maximal IEMG activity was less than one-third of that from the masseter. Maximal IEMG activity was reduced for the masseter during forward flexion, and for the suprahyoid muscle group during backward extension. Head posture is an important factor in EMG registrations of opening and closing muscle function during chewing. During upright head posture, the hyoid bone exhibited on average an elliptical movement pattern and reached its most elevated position at the start of opening and its most depressed position at the start of closing. A small movement before opening an upward and forward direction and before closing in a further downward and backward direction was found. Suprahyoid EMG activity was registered before start of opening, during opening and during the first half of the open phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The present investigation included 53 patients with dysphagia examined cineradiographically with the head held in resting posture, flexion and extension. The ability to protect the airways by the downward movement of the epiglottis and by obliteration of the laryngeal vestibule was studied in different postures of the head. Of 35 patients with normal laryngeal obliteration with the head in resting position 10 showed a defective closure at swallowing in extension. In 18 patients with defective closure of the laryngeal vestibule in resting position 9 were improved on flexion and two on extension of the head. In one patient with defective closure of the laryngeal vestibule in resting position swallowing in flexion showed an aggravated dysfunction. In four other patients the defective closure became more marked on extension. Four patients had less effective downward movement of the epiglottis with the head in extension. Of 10 patients with defective epiglottic movement with the head in resting position two were improved on tilting the head forwards. The results show that the position of the head influences the closure of the airways during swallowing. Patients with defective protection of the laryngeal vestibule should be instructed to swallow with the head tilted forwards."

Sustained 10-15 Gz capabilities of current and future planes outstrip safe physiologic limits in spite of the combined use of World War II-vintage straining maneuvers and relatively ineffective anti-G suits to prevent losses of vision and consciousness. However, the extreme arterial pressure increases needed to maintain cerebral blood flow (e.g. 400 mm Hg at heart level during exposures to 13.5 G when sitting upright) carry risks of anatomic damage to the circulatory system and rupture of air-containing, essentially unprotectable, lungs. These could be minimized, and incapacitating losses of consciousness avoided, by use of horizontal positions designed to eliminate heart-to-head hydrostatic gradients. Development of a prone-position cockpit with a counterweighted, forward-looking head support plus optical-electronically aided all-directional visibility is the most physiologic, safest, and surest way to achieve this goal."

This is of interest in the current analyses of the relation between head posture and craniofacial morphology. The purpose of the present investigation was to describe the posture of the head and cervical column and the craniofacial morphology in a group of blind subjects, and to compare the findings with those previously found in male and female groups of normal subjects. The sample comprised 30 blind subjects--18 men and 12 women, aged 15 to 35 years, all of whom had been without perception of light since birth. The control group comprised 120 male dental students in the age range 22 to 30 years and 51 female dental students in the age range 22 to 27 years. The analysis of head posture showed that the intra-and interindividual variabilities of the craniovertical angles were significantly larger than those of the craniocervical angles in the blind group. The interindividual variabilities of the craniovertical angles were significantly larger in the blind than in the control group, but the variabilities of the craniocervical angles were similar in both groups. Craniovertical relations thus were more variable in the blind subjects, whereas craniocervical relations showed the same variability as normal subjects. On the average, the head was carried in a 4.3 degrees lower position in the neck was 4.5 degrees more forward inclined in the blind group. No differences were found in the position of the head in relation to the cervical column between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

  "abstract": "Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an association between craniocervical angulation and craniofacial morphology. It was the aim of the present study to determine if the growth coordination suggested by this association could be detected in a longitudinal analysis of growth changes in posture and craniofacial morphology. The sample comprised 43 children, 20 girls and 23 boys. Cephalometric radiographs obtained in the natural head position (mirror position) were taken on two occasions. Mean age at the first observation was 9.5 years; mean period of observation was 2.7 years with a range from 1 to 4 years. Forty-one reference points and four fiducial points were digitized on each film. Individual growth changes were determined by computerized structural superimposition of the digitized sets of points. Correlation coefficients were calculated between growth changes in 11 postural and 35 morphologic variables. Correlations of r = 0.41-0.55 (P less than 0.01) were found between the change in craniocervical angulation and the true growth rotation of the mandible as assessed by the method of structural superimposition. On the average, a reduction of the craniocervical angle was seen in connection with increased forward rotation of the mandible and an increased craniocervical angle was found in conjunction with a less-than-average forward rotation of the mandible. The true mandibular rotation was masked by remodeling of the lower mandibular border. The changes in the conventional measures of head posture--the craniovertical angles--during the observation period showed no associations with the growth changes in craniofacial morphology."

Because there is no scientific basis for recommending either of the two corrective neck positions, we simulated the three neck positions in 10 normal adults and compared the integrated electromyography (IEMG) of the upper trapezius to determine if the muscle shows less activity in any of the two corrective positions. The results showed significantly less IEMG of the upper trapezius in each of the two corrective neck positions than in the faulty neck position (p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found between the IEMGs recorded in the two corrective neck positions (p > 0.10). The implications and limitations of these findings are discussed along with suggestions for future studies. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 1986;8(5):240-242."

  "abstract": "For the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) to function properly, namely to ensure a stable retinal image under all circumstances, it should be able to take into account varying eye positions in the orbit and varying orientations of the head with respect to the axis about which it is rotating. We tested this capability by quantifying the gain and the time constant of the horizontal component of the VOR during rotation about an earth vertical axis when the line of sight (optical axis) was moved out of the plane of head rotation--either by rotating the eyes up or down in the orbit or by pitching the head up or down with respect to earth-horizontal. In either case the gain of the horizontal component of the VOR was attenuated precisely by the cosine of the angle made between the optical axis and the plane of head rotation. Furthermore, if the head was pitched up or down but the eye rotated oppositely in the orbit so as to keep the line of sight in the plane of head rotation the gain of the horizontal component of the VOR was the same value as with the head and eyes both straight ahead. In contrast, the time constant of the VOR varied only as a function of the orientation of the head and not as a function of eye position in the orbit. During rotation about an earth vertical axis, the time constant was longest (about 18 s) when the head was pitched forward to place the lateral canals near earth-horizontal and shortest (about 11 s) when the head was pitched backward to place the vertical canals near earth-horizontal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

  "abstract": "Postural stabilization in altered visual and vestibular conditions was investigated in humans subjected to fast transient disturbances and during sinusoidal movement of the standing support. Visual inputs were varied by applying stroboscopic illumination, stabilizing the visual surround in respect to head movements, inducing apparent body movement in pitch by continuously moving stripe patterns up or down and by eye closure. Static vestibular input was modified by bending the head forwards or backwards, or to the right or left shoulder (eyes closed). Neither biomechanical parameters of standing nor EMG responses of the anterior tibial and triceps surae muscles were modified by the different visual and vestibular conditions during fast transient (80 degrees/s) platform movements 4 degrees toe-up. Continuous regulation of upright stance during sinusoidal movements (1 Hz, 0.3 Hz), however, clearly depended on the different modifications of visual and vestibular inputs. Fast transient disturbances are easily compensated in a reflex-like manner independent of visual and vestibular feedback. Continuous regulation of upright posture during slow disturbances, however, clearly depends on the evaluation of afferent information from the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems."

  "abstract": "Postrotatory nystagmus I and II (P I, P II) were evoked in four normal humans by velocity steps (prior velocity of rotating chair 90 degrees/s). 4 s after the stop the head was actively tilted by the subject 90 degrees forwards, backwards, to the shoulder of the previous direction of rotation -'ipsilaterally', or to the other shoulder-'contralaterally'. In control trials, the head was kept in the previous erect position. Compared with the control experiments, P I was significantly reduced by all head tilts. Inhibition of P I was strongest with forward and weakest with backward tilts. This difference is explained by the inclination of the utricular base by 30 degrees backward with respect to the horizontal of the skull and by the elastic properties of the sensory matrix. A smaller amplitude (45 degrees) of head tilt about the roll axis leads to a weaker inhibition (28.5%) than a 90 degree tilt, which corresponds to the difference of the sine of the tilt angle and thereby reflects the mechanical force acting on the receptor layer."

There were 10 volunteer subjects who participated in 50 tests at 4 impact levels (0 G or sham, 8 G, 10 G, and 12 G). Two initial head positions were explored at the highest impact level. The manikin psychomotor task, a complex reaction time and accuracy task, was used to evaluate performance. Linear and angular accelerations were measured at the head. Although there was a weak correlation between angular head acceleration and prolonged post-impact reaction time, no compelling statistical evidence was found to support the hypothesis that psychomotor performance is degraded with increasing impact severity at these test levels. The highest test level explored in this study may not have been sufficient to produce a change in performance or, alternatively, the manikin task may not have been sufficiently sensitive to measure a change in performance if one was present. In addition, significantly lower angular head acceleration was observed at the 12-G test level when the head was rotated forward initially rather than prepositioned upright against the headrest. The potential for temporary stunning of aircrew members during operational crash landings or ditchings may be reduced by rotating the head forward prior to an imminent crash if time permits."

Body position directly affects ventilation and perfusion matching and arterial oxygen levels. This article briefly describes the role of body positioning on lung function and the clinical implications of this as a treatment priority. The effect of body position on arterial oxygen levels and lung function is discussed for the following positions: erect, lean forward, supine, lateral, prone, head-down tilt, hands and knees, and upside down. The implications of these positions are discussed for both the patient who has lung dysfunction and for the individual who may be at risk for developing pulmonary complications. Research is needed to investigate the principles of therapeutic positioning for optimal gas exchange and lung function. Such work may help to refine pulmonary physical therapy procedures and to identify the role of judicious positioning in a therapeutic exercise regimen."

  "abstract": "Apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist, physostigmine, an anticholinesterase agent and pilocarpine, a cholinergic receptor agonist, produced yawning in rats, with the most effective doses being 0.25 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg, respectively. The yawning induced by these drugs is characterized by differences in direction of head moving, tongue protruding and duration of the yawn. The apomorphine-induced yawn was characterized by a slow and wide opening of the mouth with the head moving mainly downward and with a marked protrusion of the tongue. The apomorphine-induced yawn was 3.6 sec in duration. Physostigmine elicited a similar yawn to that seen with apomorphine, except for moving of the head in the upward direction. The pilocarpine-induced yawn was characterized by the head moving forward with a high frequency but without tongue protrusion and lasted 1.8 sec. The frequency of physiological yawning was low, but the behavioral posture was almost similar to that of physostigmine-induced yawning. The characteristics of yawns induced by these agents were unchanged at all doses of the drugs. Different doses altered the frequency of yawning. After pretreatment with mecamylamine, the apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced tongue protruding was inhibited and the duration of the yawning induced by the both drugs was shortened. The results suggest that the behavioral features of yawning induced by apomorphine, physostigmine and pilocarpine differ from one another, and that physiological yawning as well as physostigmine-induced yawning may be mediated by endogenous acetylcholine which stimulates both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors."

In normals with eyes closed, soleus stretch reflex activity at 50-80 ms was followed by two bursts of tibialis anterior (TA) EMG activity at ca 80 and 125 ms from the onset of 36 deg/s, 3 deg amplitude platform rotations. Neck muscle activity rotated the head backwards at the same time as TA activity rotated the body forwards about the ankle joints. Under the influence of vision, i.e. eyes open, slight increases in the second burst of TA activity, and ankle torque were observed. When the subjects sat, and were instructed to activate TA rapidly on onset of the platform movement, TA EMG activity increased gradually at ca. 150 ms and not as a burst. In patients with long-lasting bilateral vestibular deficits, both bursts of TA activity were significantly less than normal with eyes closed. Consequently sway correcting torques were abnormally low and all but one of the patients fell over backwards. With eyes open, TA activity was slightly less than, and ankle torques were approximately equal to normal values. In contrast to normals, TA responses obtained in standing and sitting positions were not significantly different. Neck EMG activity varied from normal, consisting of a long burst 100 ms in duration. The present data indicate that a coordinated pattern of ankle, and neck muscle activity occurs during the first 150 ms following induced backward tilt. Ankle muscle activity corrects for the body sway, and neck muscle activity attempts to stabilise the head with respect to earth fixed coordinates. It is proposed that the vestibulo-spinal reflex system predominantly underlies the genesis and coordination of this muscle activity."

  "date": "1985 Jan-Feb",
  "abstract": "In 15 healthy subjects we studied body sway reactions to sinusoidal 0.3 Hz binaural bipolar galvanic current up to 2 mA under three conditions. With the head forward and eyes closed, there is only a periodic lateral displacement of the centre of gravity, following the stimulation with a phase lag. In two other conditions, the head turned to the left or to the right without trunk torsion, the direction of sway was modified in such a way that there were mainly anteroposterior movements. It is thought that this experiment shows the modulatory influence of neck afferents on the direction of vestibulospinal motor effects in man."

  "abstract": "Changes in hyoid position in relation to changes in mandibular inclination and craniocervical posture were studied by roentgen cephalometrics in a sample of 24 long-term complete denture wearers over a 15-year period. The measurements were made on lateral occlusion films obtained with the subjects in the sitting position and with the head oriented according to its natural balance. The changes in mandibular inclination ranged from -5.5 degrees to 8.6 degrees, with a mean of zero. The cervical column became significantly more forward inclined (mean, 5 degrees), and the craniocervical angulation became on an average 5 degrees larger. Correlation analyses indicated that the hyoid position was influenced by two postural systems: the changes in mandibular inclination and the changes in cervical and craniocervical posture. The vertical changes in hyoid position in relation to the upper face largely followed the patterns of increase or decrease in mandibular inclination, whereas the horizontal changes mainly followed the changes in cervical inclination and craniocervical angulation."

The purpose in this study was to investigate the changes in the resting vertical dimension of the mandible with correction of a forward head posture in an edentulous patient. Ten treatments of manual physical therapy techniques, such as joint mobilization and muscle stretching to correct the forward head posture, were administered. A plumb line test showed an improvement of the forward head posture. In addition, the resting vertical dimension of the mandible increased an average of 8 millimeters. This result suggests that correct head posture may be necessary to precisely calculate the resting vertical dimension of the mandible.J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 1985;5(4):179-183."

In 11 of 13 subjects studied, we (C.W.Y. Chan and R.E. Kearney, 1982, Neurosci. Lett. 33: 333-338) found that the H reflex was a minimum when the head was near the vertical position, and often increased as a sinusoidal function of tilt to a maximum of 60 degrees forward or backward. In contrast, I.G. Aiello, G. Rosati, G. Serra, V. Jugnoli, and M. Manca (1983, Exp. Neurol. 79: 18-26) reported a linear decrease in the H reflex amplitude in all their subjects when the body was tilted from the vertical to the horizontal supine position. The differences in these findings were discussed from the point of view of methodology and in light of recent animal and human studies."

  "date": "1983 Dec",
  "abstract": "Maternal treatment with methylmercury (MeHg) has been shown to induce a high frequency of cleft palate and produce growth retardation in rat and mouse fetuses, but the relation between these effects is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if mandibular growth retardation was a factor that contributed to induction of cleft palate in C57BL/6J mice. Two doses of MeHg (10 mg/kg maternal body weight) were given subcutaneously on days 10 and 11 of gestation, and the fetuses were morphometrically studied on days 14, 15, and 18. Full clefts of the secondary palate were present in approximately half of the treated day 15 and 18 fetuses; therefore, the cleft palate (CP) and noncleft palate (NCP) groups were analyzed separately to facilitate identification of morphologic changes associated with the clefting. The results showed that, compared with controls, the day 14 MeHg-treated fetuses had significantly smaller placental weights, but only half of the fetuses had delayed palatal shelf elevation, reduced body weight, and delayed morphological development. However on day 15, the CP and the NCP groups had similar reductions in body weight and placental weight. A striking downward and forward positioning of the head was present in the MeHg-treated fetuses with the CP group more severely affected than the NCP group. Significant differences between the three groups (control, NCP, and CP) were present with mean head-to-body angles of 67 degrees, 60 degrees and 51 degrees, respectively. The absence of normal head lifting resulted in a relative mandibular retrognathia that when combined with a decrease in mandibular length produced alterations in spatial relations that were most severe in the CP fetuses. The results suggest that after exposure to MeHg, palatal closure is affected by altered tongue posture associated with the abnormal head positioning and shortening of the mandible that develop following placental and embryonic growth retardation."

  "abstract": "In a group of 18 partially edentulous patients provided with immediate complete dentures, changes in hyoid bone position and craniocervical posture were examined on cephalometric radiographs made during 1 year of denture use. The findings indicated that the changes in hyoid bone position largely followed the pattern of forward-upward rotation of the mandible due to ridge resorption. During this course the hyoid position in relation to the cervical spine showed a mean increase. The hyocervical changes, however, showed less variability than the hyomaxillary and hyomandibular changes. The posture of the head and cervical column showed no definite mean changes during the 1-year period. On the other hand, analysis of individual changes revealed that a pronounced decrease in mandibular inclination due to ridge resorption was associated with retroclination of the cervical column and decreased craniocervical angulation. These postural changes may be regarded as adaptive changes to a marked initial change in mandibular position."

  "date": "1982 Sep",
  "abstract": "The length of the spinal column as a percentage of stature is smaller in the Australian aboriginal than in most other ethnic groups (Abbie, 1957). It is conceivable that relative lengths of the cervical column might influence population differences in craniocervical posture and craniofacial morphology. The present study aimed to elucidate this relationship by comparing head posture and craniofacial morphology in Australian aboriginals to the same features in a previously studied sample of 120 Danish students (Solow and Tallgren, 1976). The aboriginal sample consisted of 42 young male adults from the Yuendumu settlement, Northern Territory, Australia. Cephalometric films of the natural head position were taken during a field trip to the settlement. The comparison comprised 18 postural and 61 morphological variables. In the aboriginals, the cervical column was shorter and had a less pronounced lordosis. The head was held about 3 degrees lower, and the upper cervical column was 8 1/2 degrees more forward inclined. As a consequence, the craniocervical angle was about 6 degrees larger. Comparison of the craniofacial morphology in the two groups showed in the aboriginals a shorter upper facial height, a larger anterior lower facial height, and a larger vertical jaw relationship (NL/ML). The length of the posterior cranial base, s-ba, was 4 mm shorter (P less than 0.001) in the aboriginals, possibly developmentally related to the generally shorter spinal column in Australian aboriginals."

  "date": "1982 Apr",
  "abstract": "The upper body posture naturally adopted by long distance runners was quantified, and its effects on ventilation were assessed in 14 subjects. Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and flow-volume loop maneuvers were performed in three seated positions: 1) natural running posture (RUN), with back angled forward 11 degrees, neck flexed, and head extended 35 degrees forward of the spinal column; 2) back vertical with head and neck as above (NEF); and 3) head and back vertical (VERT). MVV was significantly higher in RUN compared with both NEF and VERT, as were peak inspiratory pressure (PImax) from functional residual capacity, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and peak inspiratory flow (PIF). Expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity was significantly higher in RUN and NEF than in VERT, consistent with reported increases in flow due to tracheal stiffening. The increased PIF and PImax in RUN indicate increased inspiratory muscle tension and/or improved transduction of tension into a more negative pleural pressure. Magnetometer tracings of rib cage dimensions demonstrated greater anteroposterior stability during maximal inspiratory efforts in RUN compared with VERT. The improved inspiratory function seen in RUN may be due to more effective diaphragmatic and/or accessory muscle function. These findings demonstrate that the position naturally adopted by long distance runners favors ventilation."

One aim of this investigation was to provide information concerning clinical vertigo symptoms. Standing on a rotatable stabilometer, 25 healthy subjects had to execute lateral head tilts during (Coriolis), or after (Purkinje), rotation varied with different constant velocities. The conditions were varied with respect to eyes open vs. eyes closed, head upright vs. head tilt to the right and left, direction of rotation clockwise vs. counterclockwise, active vs. passive head tilt, and active vs. passive body rotation. The results supported the expectation that destabilization was less severe with open than with closed eyes and that sway amplitudes were increased after head tilt as well as with a higher velocity of rotation. The direction of the induced body shift was, as expected, opposite to the initial vestibular stimulus. A forward shift after stop without head tilt was frequently found, being independent of the previous direction of rotation. Reported perceptions coincided mostly not with the initial vestibular signal but rather with the actual movement of compensation. Active instead of passive movements did not produce clearly different effects. The Purkinje experiment appeared to be equivalent to the situation when a patient with an acute lesion of a horizontal vestibular canal bends his head. The stabilogram under this condition may allow a prediction of the side of the lesion."

Consecutive short period of negative horizontal acceleration (0.7-0.95 g) were achieved by brisk braking manoeuvres of the car, followed by weak reacceleration (0.15 g). Motion sickness symptoms were observed and recorded after each experiment using a special motion sickness scaling index which was weighted according to the strength of any particular symptom. The results indicate that horizontal linear acceleration in a car, such as experienced during multiple breaking manoeuvres, is an effective motion sickness provoking stimulus. Negative X-axis stimulation is more nauseogenic then acceleration in the Z-axis stimulation is more nauseogenic then acceleration in the Z-axis of the body."

  "abstract": "Tolerance of the circulatory system of fish for gravitational stress has not been measured previously. We examined this in bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis) by placing them horizontally on a V-board in air while their gills were perfused with aerated seawater, then tilting them head up for 0.5 h, and finally returning them to horizontal. Meanwhile, we recorded the blood pressure, pulse pressure, and heart rate in the ventral aorta, and interstitial fluid pressure in the head and tail. All four bluefish tolerated a 30 degrees tilt or even a 60 degrees tilt with little change in blood pressure or interstitial pressure in the anterior and posterior regions. All recovered afterward. However, in the seven dogfish examined, the posterior interstitial fluid pressure increased from 2.8 +/- 1.0 cmH2O before tilting to 11.8 +/- 3.3 cmH2O toward the end of a 30 degrees tilt lasting 30 min. The blood pressure decreased as the pulse pressure approached zero, showing that circulatory insufficiency had developed due to insufficient venous return to the heart. Most of the dogfish died within a few hours after the experiment. These findings are in keeping with the conclusion that the vasculature of bluefish has more rigidity, less permeability, and perhaps more compensatory tone than that of smooth dogfish. We speculate that bluefish may have evolved their circulatory tolerance for gravity as a cross-adaptation to the stresses imposed on the circulation by forward acceleration and by regional differences of transcutaneous pressure occurring during fast carangiform swimming."

Bilateral infusion of the GABA antagonists in the MRF-DLSC elicits compulsive gnawing and biting but not licking or sniffing. Infusion of GABA-receptor agonists (muscimol, THIP) in the MRF-DLSC while producing only minor or no motor or behavioural effects, drastically altered apomorphine effects; thus, unilateral infusion of muscimol resulted i tight, head-to-tail ipsiversive circling while bilateral infusion of muscimol converted the apomorphine-syndrome from stereotypy of high-intensity into pure compulsive forward locomotion devoid of sniffing. The results indicate that GABAergic mechanisms in the MRF-DLSC are of primary importance in the expression of motor and behavioural syndromes arising from the striatum."

The apparent mechanical efficiencies of the work performed with a head and following wind were approximately +0.35 and -1.2. At WV greater than 15 m . s-1 it was more efficient to run against the wind and the corresponding gradient on the treadmill. At high WV the subjects altered their posture and \"leaned\" into the wind, thus possibly converting potential drag into body lift. The energy cost of overcoming air resistance on a calm day outdoor was calculated to be 7.8% for sprinting (10 m . s-1), 4% middle-distance (6 m . s-1), and 2% marathon (5 m . s-1) running."

  "date": "1979 Mar 23",
  "abstract": "The Eshkol-Wachmann movement notation is used to analyze and describe neurological recovery from the akinesia caused by severe bilateral lateral hypothalamic (LH) damage in rats. Exploratory movement recovers along several relatively independent dimensions which appear successively. First, lateral head scanning movements recover. At about the same time or later, longitudinal (backward-forward) head scans appear. After movements along these two dimensions increase in amplitude and involve the whole body, vertical (dorsal-ventral) head scans with snout contact (along vertical surfaces) typically appear, and increase gradually in amplitude. Later, vertical rearing without snout contact emerges. Recovery proceeds cephalocaudally, as more caudal limb and body segments are recruited along each of the above dimensions separately. LH rats show delayed recruitment of caudal limb and body segments ('strait-jacket phenomenon'). Support of the body and management of limb and body segments' contact with the ground also recover relatively independently, in a proximodistal fashion. In recovery, arrests between bouts of activity become shorter. Movement first becomes organized in relation to the animals' own body, and only much later, in relation to the environment. In each sequence of movement after pronounced immobility, the rat recapitulates the process of recovery; and, any time it starts to move, it repeats the movements at a particular amplitude several times until there is an increase to the next larger size movement ('warm-up' phenomenon). These regularities explain the apparently bizarre stereotyped behavior in partial enclosures ('behavioral traps') seen in LH rats recovering from akinesia. They also explain some aspects of exploration in rats and normal social behavior of wild animals, particularly in situations involving fear and conflict."

  "abstract": "In 40 adult patients stabilized on the tilt table, no evidence was found that the amount of activity at rest in spastic muscles depends on the position of the head in space. The influence of postural labyrinthine reflexes (Magnus) was not confirmed. The activity in spastic extensor muscles was significantly higher (t greater than 1%) in the prone position. The activity in spastic flexor muscles was higher (t greater than 1%) in the supine position. Extralabyrinthine forces (tonic stretch reflexes and exteroceptive reflexes) are assumed to be decisive in these changes. In the same group of patients, the symmetric deep neck reflexes were examined. The patient actively flexed his head forwards or backwards. Significant increase in the activity at rest in spastic extensor muscles on dorsal flexion of the head in the prone position was found (t greater than 1%). Significant increase in the activity at rest in spastic flexor muscles on ventral flexion of the head in the supine position was also found (t greater than 5%). The phenomena of irradiation are assumed to be decisive in these changes. In another group of 27 adults the asymmetric deep neck reflexes (Magnus and De Kleijn) were examined. The patient actively turned his head either to the left or to the right, while his arms were raised (Hoff-Schilder maneuver). When the degree of rotation of the head was slight, the trunk and arms deviated in the same direction. When the rotation of the head was extreme, and reached behind the shoulder, the trunk and arms often reversed the direction of deviation. The effect of asymmetric deep neck reflexes was not confirmed. Visual perception and the mechanism of focusing are assumed to be decisive in these changes. The head turns toward the object of interest in the visual field by the mechanism of eye-centering (Bender) and influences the position of the trunk and motor patterns of the upper extremities (motor principle \"eyes-hand\")."

Headache due to faulty muscle pattern (stereotype) resulting in overstrain of the upper fixators of the shoulder girdle (upper part of the m.trapezius and levator scapulae); faulty respiration with the aid of the upper auxillary muscles even at rest is pointed out. 2. A forward drawn head position producing static overstrain in the posterior neck muscles and compensatory retroflexion of the cranio-cervical junction resulting in blockage in this region. 3. Anteflexion and ligament pain mainly due to faulty position at work and jolting. 4. Static disturbance in the frontal plain due to obliquity producing asymmetrical strain in the neck musculature. 5. Increased muscular tension due to psychological stress. 6. Blockage in the regions of the cervical spine, shoulder girdle and upper ribs with reflex muscular spasm. 7. Reflex spasm of the neck musculature in visceral disorders causing in addition blockage of the cervico-thoracic junction (heart, gall bladder). 8. Pain arising from the posterior arch of the atlas (here described for the first time). 9. Headache due to vertebral artery involvement. The type of headache seems to be determined rather by the individual mode of reaction than by the mechanism underlying it. As a rule a combination of mechanisms is actually found."

Preoperatively, patients with rheumatoid arthritis functioned at lower levels than patients with osteoarthritis. Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis improved steadily after surgery, while progress of those with osteoarthritis was often irregular. The group with rheumatoid arthritis improved more than those with osteoarthritis, but they did not generally reach the functional level attained by the patients with osteoarthritis, and neither group reached the lower limits of normal variability 1 year postoperatively. On the average, both groups gained knee extensions, lost knee flexion, and gained isometric knee flexor muscle strength postoperatively. Every patient with osteoarthritis lost extensor muscle strength 1 year after surgery, while most with rheumatoid arthritis gained. During quiet standing, most patients had straighter knees postoperatively and bore a greater percent of body weight on the operated limb. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis improved more than patients with osteoarthritis in the type and amount of force applied to canes and crutches. Most patients walked faster postoperatively, took longer and more rapid steps, improved the pattern of knee motion used, and had smoother forward, lateral and vertical head motion."

When a 60 sec BH or FI was performed while leaning forward, there was a significant linear correlation between the maximal bradycardial response (delta HRmax) and ambient pressure for simple BH (r-0.08, P less than 0.05) and 31 degrees C FI (r = 0.91, P less than 0.01), but not for 27 degrees C FI. A similar trend was seen during 30 sec BH's while seated erect. The facial cold-dependent component of the FI bradycardia was not significantly altered by pressure. In general, there were significant correlations between the initial HR and the initial thoracic conductive volume (TCV; measured by the four-electrode Minnesota impedance cardiograph), and between the initial TCV and delta HRmax observed during seated erect BH's. Since the TCV was generally higher at depth, it is suggested that a mechanical effect due to increased TCV at depth, possibly related to increased gas density, is at least partly responsible for the pressure dependence of BH bradycardia."

  "abstract": "Horizontal and vertical optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) and optokinetic after-nystagmus (OKAN) of squirrel monkeys were compared with those of rabbits, cats and humans that were previously described. Squirrel monkeys showed similar findings to cats, in which vertical optokinetic nystagmus (VOKN) is not as well elicited as horizontal optokinetic nystagmus (HOKN) and down-pursuit OKN is poorer than up-pursuit OKN. As to the reasons that bring about different responses of OKN and OKAN (and vestibular nystagmus) in different planes, we speculated two possibilities: compensatory activation of horizontal eye movement for narrowed visual field accompanied by frontally positioned eyes, and the gravity that restricts and modifies posture and locomotion. Directional difference of VOKN may be caused by a physiological mechanism that makes visual fixation not susceptible to downward movement of the ground surface during forward locomotion."

  "title": "Clinical test for anterolateral rotary instability of the knee",
  "date": "1976 Jul-Aug",
  "abstract": "A simplified test for anterolateral rotary subluxation of the knee is largely based on the concepts described by Galway and McIntosh although performed in a different manner. The examiner places the right hand gently on the lateral side of the knee with the thumb overlying the posterior aspect of the fibula and the index finger palpating the anterolateral aspect of the joint line to determine the the tibiofemoral relationship. The left hand embraces the lateral side of the distal end of the femur with the thumb over the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. With equal pressure on the lateral femoral condyle and fibular head the knee is pushed gently forward into flexion. When anterointernal tibial luxation is present, a reduction phenomenon is felt as the knee passes into the 25 to 40 degree flexion range. This may occur as a sudden palpable and occasionally audible repositioning which is responsible for such terminology as a \"pivot shift\" or \"jerk sign.\" We have experienced many instances where the reduction phenomenon is more subtle and is determined by palpation alone. The pathologic mechanics are determined by observations at surgery in 45 patients with a positive test. This test has improved our diagnositc ability and is easly taught to those unfamiliar with knee joint disorders."

  "title": "Unconsciousness, automatisms, and myoclonic jerks with diffuse rhythmic 9-Hz discharges",
  "date": "1975 Sep",
  "abstract": "A 25-year-old man presented with seizures characterized by unconsciousness, automatic behavior, and myoclonic jerks lasting 0.5 to 8 sec. Videotape analysis of 300 simultaneously recorded electroencephalographic and clinical attacks revealed 8- to 9-Hz 150 to 200 muV sharp waves beginning in both medial temporal areas during eyelid flutters. When discharges spread diffusely on both sides and lasted 2 to 3 sec, 20 degrees forward flexion of the head, unconsciousness, pupil dilation, and staring became evident. Asymmetrical myoclonic jerks invariably appeared. When paroxysms were greater than 3 sec, automatisms and tonic posturing occurred. The electroencephalographic and clinical seizures appeared during the awake and relaxed states, i.e., with normal alpha rhythm. They were suppressed during physical and mental activities and during sleep, i.e., in the absence of alpha rhythm. Our studies suggest that these seizures associated with diffuse electroencephalographic alpha-like activities are subcortical in origin and should be tested in their responsivity to alpha suppressants and inducers."

  "title": "[Topographical radiological anatomy of the extra-hepatic biliary system seen in lateral view. Tone and projecting movements of the hepatic/bile ducts (author's transl)]",
  "date": "1975 Apr",
  "abstract": "This study is based essentially on lateral views of 244 examinations of the biliary tract by non-operative trans-hepato-cholecystographic radiomanometry and on some lateral views of cholecystograms. Despite the classical conception (Lutkens) of gall bladders invariably oblique, it showed that some are vertical, horizontal or even descending. Contrary to this classical conception which describes the infundibulum and cystic ducts as being oblique from the front backwards in the same direction as the long axis of an oblique gall bladder, these lateral views showed that, whilst the infundibulum may continue in the same direction as the long axis of the gall bladder, the same does not apply to the neck and cystic duct. They run from behind forwards and almost always in the direction of feet to head of the subject. Very rarely the neck is directed from head to foot. In addition, and once again contrary to Lukens description, the common bile duct is not the most posterior of the parts of the biliary tree. It is the infundibulocervical region which is the most inclined, regardless of the type of gall bladder. These lateral views also made it possible to demonstrate the pathognomic appearances of hypotonic and hypertonix hepatic/bile ducts and the antero-posterior projecting movements of the main bile duct."

  "abstract": "A transistor radio activated by a mercury switch was used to reinforce head posture in two retarded children with severe cerebral palsy. Under the contingent music condition dropping the head forward automatically terminated the broadcast (music). A comparison of baseline and treatment phases showed that head orientation was strongly controlled by contingent music."

  "title": "Influence of head orientation on visually induced pitch and roll sensation",
  "date": "1975 Mar",
  "abstract": "Observers viewing rotating scenes in their periphery frequently experience self-motion in the opposite direction. A full field (360 degrees) flight simulator projection system was used to investigate the sensations resulting from pitch, roll, and yaw stimuli at various head orientations. Steady yaw rate (circularvection) and development of a constant roll tilt angle, for the head erect and constant velocity yaw and roll stimuli, confirmed previous reports. Pitch stimuli also were found to produce a sensation of tilting to a steady pitch angle, which was much stronger for pitch forward than backward. Pitch and roll effects were strongly dependent on head position, increasing for the head rolled 90 degrees to the side or inverted, and decreasing for the head pitched 25 degrees forward. These results support a hypothesis that visually induced tilt is limited by conflict with otolith information."

  "date": "1975 Feb",
  "abstract": "The hypothesis is put forward that the disturbance of gait seen with tumours of the posterior fossa is largely due to subacute dilatation of the ventricular system and not to the involvement of midline cerebellar structures concerned with balance or the coordination of truncal muscles, as is widely taught. This hypothesis is examined in the light of the clinical evidence provided by the symptomatology and treatment of 19 consecutive cases of intracranial mass lesions exhibiting truncal ataxia."

  "abstract": "The clinical picture, radiological findings and treatment of 22 patients with atlantoaxial subluxation and rheumatoid arthritis are described. This lesion, untreated, may result in damage to the spinal cord, paresis or sudden death. Occipital headache, present in 13 of 22 patients, was often aggravated by working with the head in forward flexion. Paresthesias were present in six patients. The spine of the axis was often prominent. In three patients there was objective evidence of cord compression with sensory and/or pyramidal signs. In eight the lesion was asymptomatic and discovered by routine lateral radiography in flexion, the position of maximum subluxation.Conservative treatment involved the continuous use of a cervical collar to limit neck flexion. This usually relieved subjective symptoms including headaches. Successful surgical fixation was performed in two individuals. Surgical indications included acute or chronic cord compression or severe symptoms unrelieved by a collar."

  "title": "Postural vertigo and positional nystagmus",
  "date": "1952 Dec",
  "abstract": "Oscillation of the eyes of a patient when the head is placed in a certain position is objective evidence to support a complaint of postural vertigo-dizziness when the head is tilted forward or upward or turned to one side or the other. Since positional nystagmus may be difficult to evoke and may be elicited at one time and not at another, it is important to make repeated tests, lest a causative lesion be overlooked. Vertigo in such cases may be caused by pathologic change in the eighth peripheral nerve or in the central vestibular pathways. Sometimes no organic disease is observable even though positional nystagmus validates a complaint of vertigo. In such instances the patient should be assured that he does not have a progressive disease and be advised against activity in which dizziness would be hazardous."
